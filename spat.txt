read spat wieners
i think that i might be feeling a tickle of inspiration to write more spat stuff soon
gotta up those server numbers
it's rude you fucking wiener
are you being a fucking ass again
of FUCKING COURSE
i love the young people
what's happening in here
you just lost the game, by the way
you sound delirious, have you had your daily dose of soda
it's because you deserve suffering, nat
gremlin
thanks woc
i have 100% faith in woc actually
i pinged woc and nat and told them to fix their bot so it'll happen randomly in the future
woc and nat made the best bot in the world
arquius is actually the shit
so this basically reads my messages to post them later right
does this go through my message history
or recent messages
woc i agree that sometimes your official tone is hard to distinguish from your joking one
woc, don't do that
i like to think that woc's comments are always relevant
nat you literally drink soda as often as most people drink water
nat don't you have a soda bottle to suck or something
i would pay a lot of money to listen to an audiobook of nat reading the iliad
that's because you deserve nothing but cruelty, nat
you fucking wiener
wiener
you're all wieners
nat banned for being a dirty soda gremlin
nat is a weapon of pure sarcastic hostility
the only thing makin is in charge of now is clowns
funnily, that's only because makin kicked me one day as a joke
i have to admit, i'm really surprised that makin enjoyed it at all
guess i'll wait to release until tomorrow when makin can determine if there's any commentary he wants to add or if there's important shit i missed
is makin still alive today
how about freddy got fingered tomorrow afternoon, after makin's community stream
a game that's more about being a game or a game that wants to tell a story
thanks nat
which is good because a game CAN have a complicated story, but people can get lost in that and make it get in the way of the game when it's not really supposed to

you fucking wiener

you're all wieners
but tensei, homestuck is all about being meta now
thanks woc
i haven't felt so strongly about homestuck content in over half a year
i don't usually make it a habit to listen to homestuck music, but a couple of these tracks i'm gonna have to add to my rotation
i didn't really take in the homestuck 2 update to be honest
the parts of homestuck 2 that reference internet culture feel just like references, and not really a commentary
like, i think it's been said a million times that homestuck is a deconstruction/commentary on internet culture
i need to reread homestuck proper to get a better handle on this, but i feel like it there's a fundamental difference in how internet culture is being treated now versus then
A final 4/13 project to announce before the day closes out: another reanimation, this time for [S] Collide! The team, headed by jujube(taasteMe), worked on it for over a year. There are some really great sections in here, so check it out! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdFdXOdfcrc&feature=youtu.be>
i havent sifted dirt in years
eat dirt wieners
thanks woc

why does homestuck 2 have to be so unmemorable
i specifically do not donate to the homestuck patreon for a reason
if you enjoy homestuck, i think that there's a lot of cultural context in there that's easier to appreciate if you like
i guess i should take from homestuck 2 stuff for it
because homestuck's fanbase is like 1/1000th of what it used to be, if that
kind of like homestuck
`Homestuck makes me wanna be dead.`
