i fucking love dirt
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
shut up makin
why does the internet have to be so fucking wonderful
<@!257144766901256192> ||get fucked idiot üêî||
GOTTA SCRATCH THAT OLD ITCH
you have no power over me <@!125433170047795200>
read spat wieners
i think that i might be feeling a tickle of inspiration to write more spat stuff soon
gotta up those server numbers
it's rude you fucking wiener
are you being a fucking ass again
of FUCKING COURSE
i love the young people
what's happening in here
you just lost the game, by the way
you sound delirious, have you had your daily dose of soda
it's because you deserve suffering, nat
gremlin
thanks woc
i have 100% faith in woc actually
i pinged woc and nat and told them to fix their bot so it'll happen randomly in the future
woc and nat made the best bot in the world
arquius is actually the shit
so this basically reads my messages to post them later right
does this go through my message history
or recent messages
woc i agree that sometimes your official tone is hard to distinguish from your joking one
woc, don't do that
i like to think that woc's comments are always relevant
nat you literally drink soda as often as most people drink water
nat don't you have a soda bottle to suck or something
i would pay a lot of money to listen to an audiobook of nat reading the iliad
that's because you deserve nothing but cruelty, nat
you fucking wiener
wiener
you're all wieners
nat banned for being a dirty soda gremlin
nat is a weapon of pure sarcastic hostility
the only thing makin is in charge of now is clowns
funnily, that's only because makin kicked me one day as a joke
i have to admit, i'm really surprised that makin enjoyed it at all
guess i'll wait to release until tomorrow when makin can determine if there's any commentary he wants to add or if there's important shit i missed
is makin still alive today
how about freddy got fingered tomorrow afternoon, after makin's community stream
a game that's more about being a game or a game that wants to tell a story
thanks nat
which is good because a game CAN have a complicated story, but people can get lost in that and make it get in the way of the game when it's not really supposed to
wiener
wieners
WIENER
you fucking wiener
wiener
you're all wieners
but tensei, homestuck is all about being meta now
thanks woc
i haven't felt so strongly about homestuck content in over half a year
i don't usually make it a habit to listen to homestuck music, but a couple of these tracks i'm gonna have to add to my rotation
i didn't really take in the homestuck 2 update to be honest
the parts of homestuck 2 that reference internet culture feel just like references, and not really a commentary
like, i think it's been said a million times that homestuck is a deconstruction/commentary on internet culture
i need to reread homestuck proper to get a better handle on this, but i feel like it there's a fundamental difference in how internet culture is being treated now versus then
A final 4/13 project to announce before the day closes out: another reanimation, this time for [S] Collide! The team, headed by jujube(taasteMe), worked on it for over a year. There are some really great sections in here, so check it out! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdFdXOdfcrc&feature=youtu.be>
i havent sifted dirt in years
eat dirt wieners
thanks woc
wiener
wieners
why does homestuck 2 have to be so unmemorable
i specifically do not donate to the homestuck patreon for a reason
if you enjoy homestuck, i think that there's a lot of cultural context in there that's easier to appreciate if you like
i guess i should take from homestuck 2 stuff for it
because homestuck's fanbase is like 1/1000th of what it used to be, if that
kind of like homestuck
`Homestuck makes me wanna be dead.`

did we already talk about the genesis project update today
<https://genesis-project-news.tumblr.com/post/615381598740873216/happy-4-13>
if not, look at it and tell me if this is worthy of an announcement
even though the multiplayer was a nightmare last time, it was still pretty neat
because i know less about this stuff than you do, and technically you work for me now
you're getting rikered
For those of you interested, The Genesis Project pushed out an update for 4 13~~(PM in the Congo)~~. Adds some cool stuff and has a working version for Mac users! https://genesis-project-news.tumblr.com/post/615381598740873216/happy-4-13
Part of the reee crowd
I took this for granted but then stepped back for a second and really considered it, and what it means
You ever have those moments of clarity where you realize just how far you've gone down a particular rabbithole
I'm just amazed at how niche and esoteric internet culture can become
There are several trees of culture whose branches reach far, and become quite small
Every so often i remember that realization and it's pretty fun
<:becomeBaby:530114746918240298>
i agree with tensei
it's easy to dismiss that meme because it's less visually obstructed
but if you really look at it from an outsider perspective, it's almost completely undiscernible what's going on
like, it's not just what you're looking at, but what the meaning is beneath it
sure, on the surface it's just a like/dislike meme
but what is actually being compared here
why is the fat husky there, so different from the pieces that came before it?
for that matter, what is a fat husky?
a deep fried meme's meaning is instantly apparent because there is nothing underneath the surface
there's no culture in it
although i would argue that the visual style is itself the source of obfuscation, for obvious reasons
it's like sensory overload, but for fun
it gets old if you see it too often
but if you go for a while not seeing one, having it pop up on your screen is somewhat disorienting
like, the intense discoloration and warping catches me off guard sometimes
<:BOOMER:576174394720911400>
ah yes, good
15 pages of my thesis today <:ree:475542526791516170>

POWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
swontch ploc
nat how many times have you called me an ogre
if i'm an ogre then you're a fucking goblin
nothing pure about you so don't even start
<@!164754340999856128> i went back and checked the vod for the community stream
if you're looking to rip it from somewhere, i did manage to catch Turnabout/Interlude
i don't know if that's kosher to say or not, i just remember you were interested
real <a:TenseiWrithe:525966655222972418> energy
really feeling this energy today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5umdIJzYgE
back to writing i go
no, for my thesis piss baby
get outa
advanced brapposting
one might even call it... shitposting
i would be wary of that
not just for reasons of vanity, but just
the gag gets old real fast

fee yaht
what happened
okay
oh hey i was listening to that earlier
sledgehammer rocks my fucking socks
took you long enough son
i got my corvette in the time it took you to start slogging your ass back to the bubble
did you find anything good
get fucked idiot
that was for you
you know who you are
also that's fair woc
i've felt pretty dispirited after the FC announcement made it seem like a big pile of shit
i wonder if frontier has responded to the enormous backlash against them
there's supposed to be some kind of statement now that the beta has been out for a bit, but i haven't been paying attention
i decided to squander a few hundred million credits on a corvette and outfitting it
initially i turned it into a fucking weapon of mass destruction, and it made me feel like a god blasting pirates into tiny pieces
but i initially pursued the ship because i wanted a better mining vessel, so i sold the weapons and kitted it properly
i've now turned to a life of humble workmanship, making hundreds of millions of credits in a single run mining low temp diamonds
truly a life of peasantry and struggle
do you wish to die, nat
i can make that happen
_in your dreams_
that sounds pretty nice
share some with me
fucking HELL i can't stop listening to god damn sledgehammer
it's got such an addicting sound to it
peter gabriel's voice is really interesting
YOU COULD HAVE A BIG DIPPER
like, at certain points it doesn't sound very clear, like he's got a bit of throatiness to him
but it fits the sound of the song perfectly
i don't often care for music but i'm completely enamored with this
that constant rhythm guitar is so good, it slaps directly into my _brain_
and the big band coming in with the blast
what's his fursona, a lemon?
i know that's lame but i have nothing, i don't actually care about neil cicierega the person too much
i think i'm kind of over caring about content creators to be honest
death of the author gang unite
wat
i was writing in my personal journal
what do you fuckers WANT
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
FUCKING NORMIES
oh, the fish
christ on a cracker
i didn't watch this last night, i saw it in my pings when i woke up
let me go check outside, i think it's snowing somehow
and then i'll look at this piece of shit
yep, middle of april and there's a little snow accumulating on the hood of my car
unbelievable
shut
i might join in, but i might not
i've suddenly found myself on a wave of energy and motivation to get shit done
i kind of want to seize it and ride it as long as i possibly can, but i also want to do whatever the fuck i feel like
so i'll probably pop in for the relevant episode
but if you try to fool me into staying for more, i will end you
aight
checking this fish shit out now cy
LET THERE BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
no i was just quoting sledgehammer again
but that having been said, i'm watching now and i do enjoy it so far
oh god
they're so creepy
wowwow... woW
holy fucking crap what IS this
wow, what
this came out on 4/13 this year?/
this gives me serious 2010 vibes
fuck, this crab is getting me
that was pretty good, thanks cy
melt that shit and inject it directly into my veins
<:jerry:568521849714245665>

COME ON, COME ON, HELP ME DO
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YOU
is that all you people care about now
linky bot
i'm right here, the _real_ linky
üò¶
nature is cruel and vicious
thank you billy herrington
a brief break from my writing so i can eat dinner
i get automatically pinged with the stats for each day thanks to the valiant efforts of woc and nat
today looks like a fucking doozy, for no reason i can tell at a glance
i'll report back with the official numbers in a bit, i need to adjust one figure
<@!131650004606648320> yes actually, both from a personal interest standpoint and from a professional one
although after a certain period of time the usefulness of the exercise drops off due to natural loss of memory
specific instances that come to mind basically all come from the molecular techniques lab class i had in my final year
where we had to conduct dna extraction and analysis
fucking pcr amplification
fucking NCBI database crawling
lab reports are basically the entirety of being a scientist
like, what i'm doing now is basically a glorified lab report
where i'm just extensively, exhaustively writing down what it is i've done and learned over the course of my graduate career
lab reports as individual things are petty and dumb
writing lab reports as a skill is extremely valuable, and you better get used to it real fucking quick
i mean, i guess i agree with that
more useful by far was writing in a notebook, like just normal everyday procedure and occurrences
although i'm honestly pretty shit at that
oh, yeah
i forgot about that
rephrasing what's on the instruction sheet is just bureaucratic inflation
more often in grad school has just been straight copying of the procedure from one source to another
>no data interpretation
what are they, animals?
i think that's a problem in most places, to be honest
even here, "experimental design" is exclusively a graduate school class
there might be an undergrad version, but let's face it
undergrad courses are piss easy comparatively speaking
i could eat an undergraduate course for fucking breakfast
graduate courses make me want to be dead
i'm lazy so i prefer it, but i also understand it's not optimal
oh, lmao
for sure
are you a teaching assistant
truly a landmark achievement
man
so i like disco, alright
it's nice and bouncy
i heard a song on the radio called "Get Up and Boogie" the other day, by Silver Convention
and i like the sound a lot
it feels like it's in a key i don't often hear with stuff on the radio
and passively it's like, "yeah, this is nice"
so i put it on to listen while i'm making dinner
i watched the video of the group dancing while performing the song, and it's
really, really simplistic and repetitive
i always knew disco was like that in the back of my mind, but this song in particular is really distinct in that regard
it's emblematic of the more empty side of disco, where it sounds good but it has very little substance underneath it
like, watch this and tell me you don't feel bored
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKGrfC1860o
fuck you woc
fuck you for making that and fuck me for seeing it
yeah, of course
i'm just pointing out this out as an example of what people mean when they disco is bad
you deserve death
the audience is completely unmoving, my god
performing in front of a crowd like this must be terrifying
there is just NOTHING
this is a far cry from the bright, pulsating dance floors i've been led to believe were ubiquitous in the 70s
but what about sequin dance outfits, and white afros
they were real, r-right
>37,000 MESSAGES TODAY
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
jesus fucking christ
we're at half a million messages for april and we're only at the halfway point

already done
let me whip it out babe
oh damn, i haven't updated the chart since march of last year
this'll be good

what do you mean
also let me do a chart for daily message count
<@!167020115143950336> i was going to include a couple of notes about highest and lowest activity days, but excel gets weird when you try to handle datasets that are too large
it's making dates have wrong message counts and shit, i cannot abide
so just have the data by itself
most active day, i believe, is 4/13/2019 with 76,483 messages sent
second most active day was this fapril at 75985 or so
also yes tera
4/13 this year was good but indeed was lower at 47,000 messages
you mean like officially sein? music album, homestuck 2 update
that's about it
which fuckin huge spike there's like ten of them
if you mean 4/13/2019 it was the epilogues announcement
there are two massive spikes, one for april fool's day (the biggest one) and then 4/13
it took me a bit but then it was like, "oh"
"this is bait"
specifically that first soygument <:howHigh:475542577362239498>
"i like objectively good movies over cheap garbage"
wow, such a soy position to take
i was going to say, this sort of stuff is fun to fuck with people over, because it is pretty ridiculous
but some people go too far with it
and then of course, the main problem is what moon said
people unironically, wholly believing in logic like that
it just makes you take a step back and reassess humanity
"are these people simpletons?
oh no
you should probably get rid of that, yes
i'm late to this but i've broadcast my feelings on art before
art doesn't need to fit a mold in order to be good, but i do maintain that art can be designated as good or bad depending on a variety of factors, inherent or otherwise
a child's scribbles are not equivalent to a painting by someone who's been practicing for years
and anyone who says otherwise is full of shit
thanks linky bot
anyway, i think it's valuable to find new artforms and means of expression
stuff doesn't need to be able to fit into a preexisting category to be interesting or """good"""
however, just because something is unprecedented doesn't mean it's automatically good
the new thing needs to be novel in a way that's striking or inspirational to other people
i'm sure there are a shit ton of things that are totally and wholly unique but are not interesting for whatever reason
also i want to clarify that i'm accounting for cultural factors here
i've had this discussion enough times that i know to point out that someone's understanding of what "good and bad art" means necessarily hinges on various possible axioms
shut up mines
stop enabling shitty artists
make them improve or perish
see, but sbahj has that almost ineffable quality to it that make it so that it's not actually bad, but i guess that depends on who you are and what kind of experiences you've had
so i guess maybe there's some threshold of common appreciation that can be described? maybe
also not to detract from this topic but man, i'm worried about this steak
it smells rich and savory but my lease precludes grilling things properly, so i have to panfry shit all the time
that's strike one
strike two is that i changed up the temperature this time and i'm not sure how that'll come out taste wise
hell, stephen king's the dark tower series is very heavily meta, although it might be kind of a strange case rather than just "YOU, THE READER, ARE INVOLVED"
i disagree cheeze
or rather
i think you're phrasing that weirdly
of course it's the job of a community to discourage harassment like that
but the problem is people like that exist regardless of encouragement
and if they want to cause a problem, they'll do it no matter what
minimizing the problem as much as possible is prudent, but eliminating it entirely is impossible
yes, and i think we do a pretty good job all things considered
if we see it happen, it gets shot down
the problem is when we aren't around to catch it
i've entertained the idea of expanding the mod team and kind of succeeded with the janitorial staff
but it's hard finding good help
short of using the search function, which has a high likelihood of missing instances of harassment cuz you need to use the right wording
yeah of course barkley
my point is we do that
i don't even know what boom is trying to say at this point
i kind of tune out when they start being more heated about shit
i looked down and saw "Several people are typing..." for a second and it made me irrationally happy
this place has changed a lot over the years but i'm still very glad it exists
i think that meme needs a little more to it to be pin worthy
not sure what though
some people view it as petty asshole hour
other people view it as "i'm disappointed with the quality of the comic" hour
i tend to see people who like the comic getting really upset with people who don't
some people take their disappointment and criticism too far, but those who like it get a little too defensive
nah
it's not as serious as you're suggesting
or prevalent i mean
wat
hm
wait, so like
a fighting game in the tradition of something like street fighter?
i'm not sure what you mean by fighting game precisely
i mean, i don't see any reason with asking
<@!257144766901256192> settle down, bulldog
i don't see what's so bad about their post history besides asking people to fill out the form too much
<@!201345607275773952> you shouldn't ask people over and over to fill something out, they'll be interested or not and you'll have to live with the number of recipients you get
now, really, what is the issue
they want feedback on something they're working on
regardless of optimism/pessimism about their project, i think that's fine
get over it soda gremlin
we will never have <#667831984479010826>
yeah, this channel isn't actually for shilling
at least, not for personal projects
we talk about literature and recommend shit to each other
well, we talk about anything really
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
i don't really know anything about it
what phase of development are you at
have you just started or do you have a working model yet
i made a comment in the survey, that having a proof of concept is the most important thing
a lot of projects i've seen or participated in got really ahead in how what they were doing looked without any attention paid to how it actually functioned
all of the projects that went that direction failed
that seems like a reasonable balance
i don't know, i'm going to reserve judgment until i see the actual results you guys come up with
it's a neat concept, i hope it goes somewhere
that would be good, sure
good luck with the development
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
we've lost so many good souls over the years
i mean, how long have you been working on it already
a level 100 anything can trash NPCs in combat
the problem is not having restoration items
like, if you could heal it as much as you wanted, you could stomp the elite 4 with a caterpie
without healing items, not really
you'd eventually get worn down, probably two or three fights in
or less depending on the pokemon
member when legendaries were completely optional encounters?
i 'member
three minutes until god bot arquius pings me with the stats for today
i'm interested to see what it turns up
that's right bitch
there it is, right on schedule
this is the greatest fucking bot in existence
stats aren't quite as crazy as yesterday but still pretty ridiculous
let me see
yeah, fucking christ
30k messages today for literally no reason i can tell
someone wake me up
not sure if that's asking me why i'm nervous or if it's a portent of disaster
fuck, that got me good
<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
sometimes the sound the floppotron makes is fucking excellent https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTtR6ZpUOo
i mean, it helps that the sound quality is appropriate for this track, but there's something really attractive in how rough this is
i mean, i saw THIS one
what are you talking about
tera i'm lazy right now
link me or suffer
oh yeah, i did see that
i was considering whether or not to pin it
it's a quality may may
DOH

so let's get-- so _let's_ ü¶Ü get underway
<@!168980988477702145> you're goin surfin on the jello net
in steven jewniverse i've always found the random included shots of a cheese factory peculiar
```"Is this heaven?"
And then came Jesus.
"Go to hell, Steven."```
this is unacceptable
i'm very disappointed in you
are you at least aware of fesh pince
it's practically required viewing material in this channel
there are so many in-jokes and references here that rely on knowledge from that guy's videos
go watch fesh pince 1 and 2, then all three steven jewniverses
i command it
here i'll even link it to make it easy for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeIkk6Yo0s8
yeah, it's only fesh pince that really matters
steven jewniverse is just a mish mash of high quality edits that all more or less have to do with steven universe
although i have to admit by the third one, it's like
"how much toy story did you watch prior to making this"
there are multiple jokes about it, with the hat on the mecha godzilla and bringing up the art director credit
the mind of krobo is obscure indeed
anyway fesh pince is a ytp on such a level that i think i genuinely consider it art
it exemplifies the genre
although i guess you could subdivide ytps into different genres, really
there are a lot of distinct styles out there
uncle phil, you got to kick that man's BUTT
god, that recreation is just
1) how many times must this guy have watched fesh pince to sufficiently memorize everything like that
2) how many tries did it take him to do this
3) where is his family
```that's B E A E N K E S. no E.```
rewatching it, it also makes me wonder just how much effort went into making the original video
this easily had to be several weeks of editing
if not more
also never noticed before, the credits that come up after the funeral for carlton are all for the my little pony tv show
there are so many fucking layers to this
<a:anumbersNUMBERS:394370289036820480>
we've often talked about watching through fesh pince
maybe we should do that once makin and whoever else stop making people watch other series
didn't they film in front a of a live studio audience most of the time
"No."
"The correct answer is... no."
üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè
`SPLERPS`
HAAAAAAAAAAAAALLELUJAH
i know ada
it's fucking outrageous
anyway, instead of watching ALL of fresh prince, we can just watch the episodes featured in the ytps
i think that would be way less of a commitment
i think between 2-4
most of fesh pince 1 takes place in i believe two episodes
if i'm not mistake there are three or four eps in fesh pince 2
hard to say
i'll do some research
like, i'm not exactly a fresh prince aficionado, i don't know off the top of my head
but i know that the election to become judge and geoffrey winning the lottery are two different episodes
then will getting shot; meeting his dad; the pool house
ah yes, thank you
<:howHigh:354512283038121984> HOW ADROIT
i'll get to community at some point
it's probably a show i watch while i play something passively in the background
no, i mean personally
i can't just do one thing at a time, it doesn't hold my attention
funniest shit i've ever seen
typically i have it on my laptop and i cook lunch/dinner while watching
perfect combination honestly, very cozy
well, except for when it gets violent
fuck you, the show is enjoyable if you aren't a stuck up wiener
that tears it, we're watching those episodes at some point soon
maybe this weekend
i'm going to find the main episodes used in the ytps and upload them tonight
or else üî™
shootin' some ball ball outside of my neighborhood
yeah, it's very snappy humor from the episodes i saw
niklink on suicide watch
mr firth could you please sit down
hey carlton... man, you ever feel like THIS? üëè
me irl
it will please you sadistic fucks to know that i am once again working with soil
no, i mean i'm conducting another experiment with dirt
measuring pH to validate an idea i had
someone posted 2B from nier automata on the subreddit today
i just got modmail from them

false alarm
tera told me the update had dropped
it was WRONG
SHAME
i just got done doing an experiment for six hours straight
which i was doing while watching/listening to LOST, mind you
ree ree, etc
so should i say there was a chili update for the channel name or do we not care enough about that
then perish
who?
i
pulled
UP to the cabin and i YELLED to the cabin
```AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA```
i'm glad to be back in the throes of fesh pince
it feels good
no
i do not
hot damn, maybe i'm not as shitty of a scientist as i thought
i'll explain in science-math like a good boy
so, we had an unexpected result in my experiments
my project is about observing the changes in soil microbial communities (specifically bacteria) based on the application of composted chicken litter
which necessarily means adding a ton of material and bacteria from inside the chicken gut microbiome
in particular, the class *Clostridiales* represents about 40% of all bacterial species inside the chicken gut
however, the results of our experiments told us that the class *Bacilli* was seeing a two-fold increase, and everything else was not increasing at all
this was really befuddling at first, but i thought about it for a while and had a breakthrough
chicken litter tends to raise the pH level of the soil due to the urea cycle, where uric acid decomposes into ammonia, which is converted into ammonium when it reacts with water
the byproduct of that reaction is hydroxide
so the pH of the soil where chicken litter is freshly added tends to go up as high as about 9.0
the optimum growth range of *Bacillus* species is... 7-8.5
so the increase in *Bacilli* species is actually reasonable
today i conducted an experiment that told me the pH value of all of our soils
unamended soil had an average pH of 5.67, and amended soil had an average pH of 5.91
due to how logarithmic scaling works...

it's a 173% increase in the concentration of hydroxide ions
or almost 2 times
which means that the two-fold increase of *Bacilli* is completely accurate
and i feel fucking great for being able to deduce and confirm this
sorry, i was letting my professor know about the data
also i was just about to look up information about the ideal growth conditions for the other phyla/classes i was seeing
i don't know about the metabolics of it, i've transitioned from less of a cellular/molecular biologist into a microbial ecologist with some genetics work on the side
silence, fool
let me check

and what do you fucking know
it seems *Clostridium* species prefer lower pH for growth than *Bacillius*
trying to figure that out, but the lower bound is about 4
why is it so fucking hard to find this info
hm
okay, i was mistaken
```pH range: 5-9 ```
so it has a lower bound than bacillus, but it can still grow in that range too
so logically it should have seen a two-fold increase as well
suddenly less convinced about this
actually
no, because the temperature range for clostridium to grow is much, much higher
it needs a temperature between 43-47C to grow properly
average internal temperature of poultry? 40.6-41.7C
average temperature of soil is typically 18-24 C
growth range for *Bacillus* temperature wise is...
25-35 C
so that might explain the discrepancy
this is the weirdest fucking source i've ever seen
i needed to know the body temperature of chickens, and literally the only source i could find that gave a straight answer was this document called the poultry production manual
produced by the university of kentucky
i've looked up and down this thing and i literally cannot find who wrote it or what year it was published
i feel dirty including this source in my works cited
holy shit
barring any suggestions from my PI or committee, i'm done with my thesis
60 pages of scientific nonsense
I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE* for the most part
i'm free to join tomorrow
why not
also nothing's official until my committee approves it
and once my thesis is approved, i need to actually defend it
that's the last hurdle, and if i pass i'll get my master's
no idea
i mean, i guess they can let me try again or i just go home with nothing
but the thing is, the person who's in charge of you generally won't let you defend if they think you're going to fail
so it depends on what he thinks, and then what my committee thinks
perpetually i have zero confidence in myself or my work, despite the fact that everyone says it's fine
my PI actually looked at a draft of my thesis a couple of days ago and said it looked fine, it just needed a bit more discussion
i added the whole experiment from today and what it meant to the discussion, so i think i'm fine
yeah, i'm not truly free until like the middle or end of may
so the tour is probably going to suffer
but we'll see what happens
bah
classic
did you guys know that there is no fucking listing for all of the episodes that are featured in fesh pince
i looked high and low and could not find one
so i compiled my own list instead
```Episode 6 - "Mistaken Identity" - Jail cell
Episode 59 - "Asses to Ashes" - Judge Robertson
Episode 63 - "Winner Takes Off" - Lottery
Episode 79 - "Will Goes a Courtin'" - Pool house, 'Opening statement'
Episode 83 - "Home is Where the Heart Attack is" - 'I'm having a heart attack'
Episode 95 - "M is for the Many Things She Gave Me" - Janice Robertson seduction
Episode 97 - "Papa's Got a Brand New Excuse" - Father episode
Episode 114 - "Bullets over Bel-Air" - Gun episode, 'I'm not carrying all of this wood'```
probably nowhere
like, who cares about fesh pince or fresh prince anymore
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
yeah, i was talking about streaming the episodes in fesh pince for context
but looking through this list, we'd probably only do
four, maybe five
the jail cell episode, the election, the lottery, pool house, and then maybe "i'm having a heart attack"
those all seem funny and not serious, which is kind of what you want from this
the gun episode and will's father are both super heavy and not suited for a group stream
also there is literally one scene taken from an episode, the clip where will is screaming?
that episode is about a woman named Janice Robertson who unkle fill went to college with
she's an "old flame" who comes to visit and then seduces will against his will
i always thought that was super fucking creepy
and weird for a syndicated tv show
but also nahg
tera, putnam, andrew and i all watched the entirety of king of the hill
it did in fact help our appreciation for the YTPs
maybe fresh prince is a different story though
like, this is a really different tone
hard to remember, i think it was inspired by the YTPs
one day we just said "fuck it, let's watch the entire series"
and then we'd do a couple hours every night for a few weeks
very fun
also now that i think about it i'm sure i'm missing some episodes
i think "You sell fish" might be from the episode with his father
but there's the one where "we've gotta attack him"
i have no idea where that one is from
either way i'm downloading all of fresh prince and reencoding those five episodes
"we've gotta attack him" is indeed from one of the episodes i already listed
good shit
tell me which one it is then
you're looking it up, disqualified
fucking HELL
every single time i hear this part
https://youtu.be/HeIkk6Yo0s8?t=669
the fucking sound gets me so good
thanks for making this masterpiece krobo
damn, the sound mixing is pretty good
"if anything i could say this is my b-ball
that was near perfect
https://i.redd.it/9cy747qu9it41.jpg
oh shit
i just rediscovered a classic
alienmyth64 had a lot of great shit and then they just fell off the face of the earth
this one is from fucking 2009 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmw-d-qB6wA
this was back when it was exceedingly common to use the hotel mario shit and other stuff in that general category
```Oooh, shit-shit-shit--eh, shit.```
i've posted this one before, same guy and same time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvXpsTCQ_-0
yeah, it just smacks of early YTP
or, well
it's not super early
it's in that phase where people were just beginning to innovate their editing
yeah
at the beginning it was just people taking straight up clips of stuff and mashing them together
maybe a token reversal
one of the earliest youtube poops i ever saw had the scene from hotel mario where he goes "where there's smoke, there's fire"
and the extent of the edit was
"where there's smoke"
then the picture rotated at 90 degree angles _very slowly_
like 1 rotation per second
and then when it came back to the original position mario said "there's smoke"
i wonder if that video is somehow still up, i'm going to look for it
holy _shit_
this is not the same video i was talking about
but this is precisely what i was talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWvzwUgEOoU
all it's missing is the fucking "where there's smoke they pinch back" opening
<:howHigh:354512283038121984> jesus fucking christ
mario says "where there's smoke" eighty billion times in this video
this was like the height of comedy back then
the spongebob one right
where she was just constantly mixing and remixing stuff on the fly
i've "watched" that one a couple times
it's like squeezing my brain through a tube
whoa, i found a LOST ytp
i didn't realize those exist
hm
it has been so long that i genuinely can't remember anymore, but i think this was one of the first YTPs i ever saw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXvBdd5DPgQ
back at the tender age of 13
dear christ
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
youtube vidsmiths passing away is always really unexpected and sad
oh thank god
big beat mario is still a classic as well, god damn
it seems really repetitive now, but this shit was groundbreaking back then
how strange it is to be nostalgic for stuff like this
i wonder what the equivalent would be in previous generations
sort of like the whole wall of vesuvius thing
dat roman graffiti
do you think people who got old in rome looked back on really degenerate shit fondly
"ah, that time flavius smeared his own feces on the wall when he drank too much wine... things aren't the same anymore"
yeah, that's been posted in here a few times
it's quality
shitposting is a time honored tradition
and i wouldn't have it any other way
holy shit <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
this is great
whenever i get around to it
spat is no longer a centerpiece of my time or effort i'm afraid
oh yeah, if you haven't seen that one
yeah, go check it out
<:annoyedpepe:309825259820023809>
WIN THE RACE
JUST WIN THE RACE
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT TAKES
cuil, you need to talk more if you want to get mentioned
them's the rules of the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQlg5aDY3c
hm
cuil, didn't you join with a different name first
i'm pretty sure i mentioned you more than that one time
ah well, i can't remember shit anymore
remember: you're here forever
unless you leave, in which case you're dead to us

i member
holy _shit_
that's a name that sears into my eyeballs
the first spongebob movie is great except for the fact that they made king neptune a fat, bald schlub instead of keeping the original design where he's literally poseidon
what the hell is this
<:kek:230307022598438912>
yes
that episode is great
it's from the first four seasons of the show, which is how you know it's quality
good ol' hillenburg still working on the show at that point
rip the big man
why on earth does sonic need a car
cuil come on
we've been jonesing for avatar for like three years
i can't remember the last time i saw it
probably before i started college
hey, don't you be knocking what we do in the shadows
the show fits that description but the movie is kino
yeah, we're like
literally about to finish LOST
you should have joined us for that when we started a couple months ago
makin don't be a prick
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
supamaketu
we still need to do ed edd n eddy at some point too
why must there be so much good shit
i highly, highly disagree
eene is carried heavily by its sound design
like, completely masterful use of stock sounds
CLASSISMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
weirdly enough i don't feel like watching breaking bad at all
i watched that show soon after it ended and i loved it
but the idea of watching it again is just repulsive
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
steven universe would be fun maybe in like a few years
once steven universe future has drained from everyone's minds
i've rewatched steven universe a couple of times and there are bits and pieces of it i appreciated more on the rewatch
it has pretty good foreshadowing
what even is early edition
i've never heard of this
reminds me of a young adult book i read in middle school once
where they had a special TV that was a day ahead of time, so they bet a shit ton of money on a horse race
makin that was over a year ago
i can barely remember what i did an hour ago, you expect me to remember this shit
need i remind you that i wrote 700 pages of bullshit so i wouldn' be able to forget it
i need a fuckin nap
no carl
they fucked it up due to hubris
it is not
for whatever reason i do remember that i never talked about this
yes, itoan is deep lore
very upsetting
27th of march 2019: late edition
makin and other people talked about some fufckin piece of shit show
nothing more for today
fuuuuuuck there's still an hour on this fesh pince download
i'll just let it run while i nap
i'm a mish mash of different things at this point
the dirt part is soil microbial ecology
i'm also somewhat knowledgeable in cellular/molecular biology and genetics
people who were born after 9/11 are almost able to legally drink in america now
there we go
i am no longer a shambling mess
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
good
the last season of samurai jack was overall pretty good
with a few of the episodes reaching true kino
the last episode is really divisive obviously
i'm in the camp of "it's not as good as it should be, but given the constraints at the time it's better than it could have been"
How Samurai Jack should have ended: "Listen, this is never easy to say. You and I both knew what we had couldn't last. I _do_ love you. But the love of my life is a lady named 'Ramblin' On'."
i'm not sure that the other people really understood the implications of what they were doing
maybe not even jack
like, the goal was always "stop aku"
and i'm not sure they thought past that
which is stupid, but let's face it
none of these people are exactly experts in time travel
yeah, aku likes large-sized pizzas
extra thicc
he can't be all that bad
woc didn't even comment on the xra reference <:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
all of those 15 seconds of effort spent double checking the quote
holy shit
i have NEVER seen any feline do that
this is some kind of anomaly
```Best stay away from that weirdo! You'll catch the feline AIDS!```
WALK AWAY... walk away... _walk away..._
`FORESHADOWING`
yeah, there are a few areas on cats you shouldn't scratch, like near the base of the tail
but the back is pretty universally good
that's what i realized about malibu
i still hate the taste of alcohol but it was much harder for me to deal with when i first started drinking with friends
malibu masked that flavor almost completely if i had it with cream soda
unfortunately, malibu is practically coconut syrup so it's fucking disgusting
ree ree
sometimes
why
i've never heard of any personally
like, it would make sense for them to exist because the mitochondria has its own distinct set of DNA
but mitochondria are also not typically found outside of their parent cell anymore
the thing is that the mitochondria doesn't have any machinery for DNA replication now
which makes it basically useless for viral purposes
that doesn't necessarily eliminate the possibility of mitochondrial viruses existing _anywaY_
i'm sure there's a possible framework for mitochondrial viruses in the sense that they simply insert themselves into that specific section of our genome
you know, hiding in critical organelles and such
but like i said, i've never heard of it
<a:pensiveWobble:530000479401279490>
this column is bad
not because the opinion is wrong, but because it's expressed like shit
like, even just this one paragraph
```This is not a personal attack. I know and respect many people who love this stupid baby game.```
```If it makes you feel that way, please, do not let me spoil your soma. But thus far, my time on the game's sandy beaches has left me with far more complaints than compliments.```
at least stick to one or the other
"don't let me ruin your enjoyment of this stupid baby game for stupid babies"
i bet this guy abuses women
okay, let me take a step back
i have no idea why i said that, it sounded funny in my head
but let me state for the record: jack crosbie of business insider is (probably) not an abuser of women
he's just a wiener
that is all
in the future you can add <> around your link to get rid of the embed
i have to admit that i don't really see the appeal either
i think people enjoy seeing how it breaks
actually i found that kind of funny
"A few hours pass by and you begin to get sleep" describes my past experiences with AI dungeon, except it's more like a few minutes
"What will you do?"
>become murderhobo
those episodes of fresh prince are ready by the way, in case we wanted to put those on
sure ifnar
i've seen this before
it's good
i just think it's neat
ooh, baby, a triple?
alright, let's DO THIS
LEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY
_JEEEEEEEEEENKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINS_
but nah who's up for fresh prince of bel air
just a few episodes
it's happening
<@&693935623966425219> we're doing a few episodes of fresh prince, specifically ones featured in fesh pince https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight
dude
watching the real episodes is so fucking weird already
FUCK
i can't believe this shit
get in here it's amazing https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight
it was spur of the moment
but i gotta tell you, this has been so fucking surreal and way funnier than i expected
"poop economy"
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
what the hell is that
<@!274676805372215297> <a:blair:424571787372658708>
wow
it was totally and completely worth it to see those original eps
i have a newfound appreciation for fesh pince, which i didn't even think was possible
if you want episode links i gottem
hot damn
this is pretty neat in a way
i might contribute some work to this even
when this first got brought up a few weeks ago, i went to the coordinates that corresponded with the house i grew up in
it would be nice to contribute the actual buildings for that
i mean, i agree it's kind of hoity toity but it's still a really neat idea
if they can't make it happen to any significant degree, then cool
oh, this last 3 minutes or so is getting really fucking out there
it's a map in minecraft, it's not like a virtual reality tour of the earth
i have no idea what i should do tonight
no, sorry
i ended up looking at my thesis again
got some comments back from my PI
also it's been over a year since i 100%ed hollow knight
i am feeling an increasing urge to stream a no-practice steel soul run
i remember the broad strokes of the game's progression but not the details
also i'm sure some of it would be challenging but i bet you i would do pretty well, if not succeed on my first try
you guys ever have that dream where captain jean luc picard of the starship enterprise who is also gwyn the lord of sunlight for some reason asks you how you're doing, and then when you say you have some stuff on your mind he invites you to a Zoom meeting with himself and his top officials, and then it turns out his top officials are just the mod team from the homestuck discord, and you _are_ captain gwyn luc picard of the lordran discord server
sounds like a pretty beta lifestyle if i'm being honest
you should probably check your prices and vaules
alright can somebody bury this
`if i were a truant boy out for a good time i'd be right here, the springfield natural history museum`
i'm down for that
i thought the whole idea was ||the man in black lost his power when the island was turned off, so lockemonster couldn't turn into the smoke again||
||he was allowed to leave but it cost him his supernatural advantage||
chomsky is a wordy guy so it works out either way
LOST streams being done feels like it has left a hole in my life
shia labeouf's HOLES, if you will
can't wait until the next big stream
but i don't like eazy cheez
and i'm trying to be healthier
i'll fill it with apple juice instead
the power of `dog` compels you
wait
what are you talking about interro
oh dear christ
this is the worst shitting thing i've ever seen
the rest of season six is like whatever to me
i've mentioned a few times that generally a work needs to stick an ending in order to have a lasting impact
i'm still processing whether or not i feel like the ending did the show justice
i'm leaning towards "yes with some minor reservations"
and those reservations are less related to any kind of deeper lore and more just about execution
||in particular, the transition in the finale to everyone being like "we're dead dude" felt pretty jarring in some respects||
i had specific details in mind last night
oh, right
one of the specific things i was thinking of was ||hurley and ben becoming the protectors of the island for an unseen amount of time and developing some kind of friendly relationship before they die||
||like, logically it makes sense but the way it ended up on screen was really awkward and didn't feel right||
dumb
THEY ALL DESERVE TO SUFFER FOREVER
<:howSmush:359301099758551053>
wait a second
i'm carlton
this is why you hire a dedicated PR person
oh, i hadn't checked those
<@&670674702821490691> and everyone else: this weekend you can join us in selecting a new show to watch, ask me or a moderator to give you the Main Show stream role if you're interested! See lovely attached image made by Makin for details, hope to see you there!
how would you have done it ifnar
give me your best shot
be the meme you want to see in the world
but if it's too shitposty then do it in altgen
i am here to serve this place, by improving its cultural quality
one meaningless platitude at a time
let's play brainstorm
let's see what happened on my island today
fuck
the god damn german clown ram moved in
i forgot about this
his name is pietro
he is a male sheep that wears clown makeup and speaks in german sometimes
also my island is named pytho
D--> will i ever find true love
lmao, i fucked up the command
let's try this again
thanks
we watched the tartakovsky clone wars
not the 3D one
yeah, we have seen xra recently-ish
the second season kind of washed over our brains but it was within the last  like
year or two
misha when did you get here
ugh
making me do WORK
For some context: we have small community streams every weekend in <#184908151185866752> based on whatever we happen to feel like watching at the time, and for the last few months we've started watching full-length TV series. The streams typically start at 3 PM EST and go on for a few hours. Hope that clears up any confusion!
man, it's been over a year since you joined
you must be feeling emotions
tides come in, tides go out
we can always count on you llf
<:drewlinkaS:404057200622043137>
you can't hide the truth
we all saw it
<:HUSKYSMUSH:464549935187230720>
i've got a hole in me pocket
does someone feel like playing through halo campaign on heroic
i played solo legendary and it felt like my brain was being squeezed through my eyeballs
but coop heroic could be fun
not possible to do four peeps on 1
we tried
i'm not sure how many of the games have 4 player coop
three and reach
yeah
god i can't wait for 2 and 3 to be released
i've never gotten to play 2 anniversary, i'm excited for it
misha, that only made me laugh because i heard it in your voice
misha's a br, yeah
the accent is obvious but for some weird reason my brain places it as slightly british
i'm gonna DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
i'm actually going to do the ripatorium real fast before i get to work
the ripatorium is the greatest idea ever
i want to play some doom but not an entire level's worth? just enter the ripatorium
BFG division is right next to the entrance too
the devs knew precisely what they were doing
honestly it's kind of hard to say
before i solidly earn my degree i'm tempted to say i don't have any free time
that's not true realistically speaking
about a month from now probably
but also i do kind of want to finish that lotro tour, especially now that we're tlaking about making it faster instead of doing a bunch of dumb SHIT\
oh hey that's great
i've been looking forward to it
i want to make my time wizard more stronk
i kind of like its base form but that being a setting would be great, yeah
see how far you make it before dying
every time i see alex jones i just want to deck his stupid face
what an awful human being
kissinger still isn't dead? god damn
the dude is 96 years old
pure evil energy must be keeping him alive at this point
i find no enjoyment in his rants
like, on some level i can appreciate that they're funny through their ridiculousness
but they just depress me
knowing that there's a not insignificant number of people who actually believe the stuff he peddles
and also the fact that he was a huge reason for doubt in the sandy hook shootings
like, regardless of his entertainment factor, the dude is obviously a piece of shit and i have no desire to give him any of my time ironically or unironically
whenever this topic comes up i remember a conversation i had with a moderate colleague
this was back earlier in the primaries when biden and sanders were the clear frontrunners but the field hadn't been winnowed yet
i don't think it is jamie
i think democrat voters are either uninformed and unattached to the process in any meaningful way, or they're holding their nose to try and avoid 2016 again
i'm sure there are some people who are loosely enthusiastic about joe biden for ~some reason~ but i can't imagine they're paying much attention
we need the bull moose party back
someone resurrect teddy roosevelt's dead fucking body
we're in hell now, tarty
no one can have anything good ever again
trump increasingly has poo brain, but after watching both him and biden, i'm hard pressed to say who has it worse at this point
i think biden may be losing control of his mind _faster_
yeah
i think trump is just a chronic moron
and that'll get worse as his brain deteriorates
biden on the other hand is literally senile
that dude is going to be dead within the next three years
a lot of trump's mistakes in speaking stem from the fact that he's extremely uneducated and is a professional braggart
like, he's made his way in life by lying about his position and esteem
so he's just doing the same thing that he's always done
to anyone who pays attention this makes him an obvious piece of shit
the mental deterioration is starting to show but not that badly, it's sort of masked by his overall incompetence
biden on the other hand is like
_clearly_ suffering from cognitive decline
intense mood swings are a sign of alzheimers
krato
i've seen you bring up that rhetoric before
i was a bernie supporter and now i'm voting for biden in the general
but you are fucking _delusional_
if you can't see how badly biden's mind is slipping
oh sure, with respect to accelerationist mindsets
i'm not surprised you have doubts
potus is landing; eyes on breen
the expectation is that you're electing a president for their full term in office
you don't want to elect someone that you only expect to live for half of a term
that would be stupid
ifnar is a kinky german
i mean, i don't personally agree with that idea, i'm just saying it's an argument htat's common in a lot of americans' minds
hence why you get the elections you see now
i don't know, it's not exactly relevant
considering he dropped out of the race
i've heard a lot of talk from relatives and acquaintances back home that biden not picking sanders as his running mate would be a death sentence
i don't even know if picking an opponent as your running mate is feasible, my political memory doesn't run that deep
oh boy, kamala harris
ah, okay
thanks for clearing that up
it's a nice conversational bent but it's just depressing
as much shit as i give him, biden has had a hard life
ifnar have you ever had cancer or a loved one with cancer
are you being purposefully dense for comedic effect or what
it's really fucking hard to deal with on multiple levels
my grandmother had thyroidal cancer when i was young, and i remember her crying a lot because the chemotherapy and radiotreatment for it had a lot of side effects that were completely miserable
she was so tired that she slept for a majority of the day, and when she wasn't sleeping she was vomiting constantly for a few days afterwards, bruised at the slightest touch, was constantly aching all over, got bacterial infections
it was a _terrible_ time for her, and i'm pretty sure thyroidal cancer is less intense than fucking _brain_ cancer
because he was so worried about it that he couldn't handle additional stress
again, are you being purposefully dense
this is completely understandable stuff
ifnar, someone doesn't stop being a person just because they're running for president
okay, you're baiting
i'm withdrawing from this conversation
this doesn't have to do with rational or irrational
you asked why joe biden wouldn't want to run for president when his son was dying from brain cancer
the answer is that a loved one dying from any kind of cancer is a horrible and emotionally taxing experience
and joe biden probably didn't want the stress of running for president on top of his son dying
that's completely reasonable
ifnar took too many rationality pills today
we need to detox him
isn't that like cowboy bebop or something
wait, is samurai cowboy a distinct thing
like, an actual existing properties
also i don't know the first thing about cowboy bebop, i don't know why my mind leapt to it
i don't think it's bait at this point, i'm pretty sure something got lost in translation at some point
yes, and we thought it was perfectly evident why someone's son dying would make them unstable
yeah, what the fuck
why would someone not be emotionally wrecked over the death of their own child
like, barring specific extenuating circumstances, that's the normal response
dude, some people _never_ get over the death of family members
ifnar irl: "alright my dad's in the ground, i will spend a few seconds in quiet contemplation.

now that that's out of the way, let's get back to casually flirting with strangers on the internet"
i mean, i guess that's just ifnar's personal attitude about death
which is completely fine as a personal thing
"i'm not personally affected by death as much as other people" is completely reasonable
the thing about this that's wtf is assuming everyone else is like that
most people get destroyed by the death of someone close to them, and the amount of time spent recovering from it can last a very long time, if indeed it stops bothering them ever
also ifnar irl: "Little boy, why do you cry. Your mother passed a week ago now. It is time to dry your tears and move on. No dillydallying  young one, or I shall have to get the belt."
i'm gonna be honest, there are little to no moments in LOST that i would consider memeable
at least not in today's cultural climate
i think that memes are more the result of common interaction over something rather than the raw quality of whatever's being memed
that's why the only homestuck memes that matter are from 2012-2014
everything else was made at times where people cared less so it's more easily forgotten
that's also why i don't give a shit about LOST memes, i wasn't around when the show was popular so none of that stuff had a real cultural impact on me
how many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man
i'll believe it when i see it
i hope not
i hope yiffy remains some kind of mcguffin that we never see
or hear what it is
that single thing would elevate this comic into greatness for me, personally
swiffer no swiffing
a lot of people were upset with jade becoming a slut in the epilogues
i can't even finish the joke i was going to make because typing that out made me laugh too hard
i guess what i want to say is that i really have no problem with it
it's not exactly in contrast with any of her established personality traits, it's just A Thing
and why not have one of the gods of the new universe be like a bacchus figure
uncontrollable rage
what we really need is the iliad and the odyssey of homestuck
the alpha and beta kids and the trolls to some extent are like the pantheon of olympus
we need some demigods that fight and kill the shit out of each other down on the ground
i'm implying that the trojan war--yes
yes, i read it last autumn
i was actually really enjoying that
nah, it's great
or, well
i think i just managed to pick a translation that did a really good job of making it clear what was happening while retaining some style
i've seen some other editions of the iliad that are fucking impenetrable
well yeah, the iliad is basically the super smash brothers of ancient greece
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
you know what that means
it's time to buy some really long calls on oil
i wonder when oil will hit the bottom
seems kind of hard to get lower than one center per barrel
oh <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i didn't realize that was the implication
that's fucking incredible
guess i'll wait a while longer before i buy stocks
actually, it's highly possible that oil never recovers from this
given the push towards renewable energy
damn, who knew it would take a global disaster to initiate this kind of cultural paradigm shift
```So my initial thought was, "Ouch, don't do that. Movie theaters are something that's dying." And then today I thought... "Let them die."```
i went to a drive in movie one summer before i came back to graduate school
or wait, let me see when it was exactly
yeah, it was for spider-man homecoming, so it was summer of 2017
something was wrong with the projector so the movie was really dark and some of the color was distorted to hell
the audio was kind of tinny coming in through the radio speakers
it was the best fucking movie experience i've had, it was just me and the other person in the car, and we didn't have to worry about people farting or coughing or using their phones next to us
fuck movie theaters
lord of the rings movies are weird when i really stop and think about them
they are so devoid of like cynicism, if that makes any sense
i guess that's the strength of the story, is that it's fantasy distilled to some really base but strong elements
at least in what we see, obviously the tolkeinian universe is more complicated
but it has features of a fantasy story that i really like, which is a very clear and obvious villain
the villainy is made obvious because evil is a concrete, tangible force
i've talked about it before in here but that idea is fascinating to me
i get caught up a lot in weighing certain ethical views and moral constraints against each other, so it's really neat to visualize it in a way that it's completely unmistakeable in nature
yeah of course, there was absolutely no literature before tolkien that was remotely like fantasy at al
how could i forget
you are a moron
go back to your ratfics
are you forgetting the concept of folklore and cultural legends
both of those ideas existed for hundreds to thousands of years before tolkien you complete wiener
lord of the rings is basically an assemblage of those ideas into a cohesive narrative
tolkien did not invent fantasy, but he definitely depicted it in a form that other people have been trying to ape for decades
what we really need is another hesiod
that would be nice
god, every time mike screams it's gold
i'm watching the quarantine catch up and the pitch of his voice skyrockets when he says the fence keeps out coronavirus
it's amazing
wow, really
even fucking drewlinky.com is secured, i'm pretty sure
and don't read a comic called homestuck
i didn't think it was possible, but i feel like my lifestyle has gotten _worse_
like for most people that's a given, staying inside for extended periods of time is no bueno
but i already did that, and now i'm just doing it more
i can almost feel myself liquifying and turning into a puddle of non-productive goo
holy shit, what
i've seen the animated movie before but i was really young, i have no recollection of this at all
i know what we're watching someday
the song does slap, yeah
i could use some fried chicken right about now
WE DON'T WANNA GO TO WAR _TODAY_
holy shit
okay, hold on, i need to manipulate an audio file
uh
okay, i went to open this in audacity and it's only playing in one ear
what the fuck
or no, it's playing in both, but it's severely panned left
this is bizarre
NOW ALL MY AUDIO IS DOING IT
WHAT
restarting it fixed it
if it happens again, audacity is a fuck
alright, just a super weird audio issue for no reason in particular i guess
now to do the edit i wanted
i mean, who  am i kidding
i'm just slowing a track down
<:loss_jpg:354791933375152129>

HE REALLY WAS HERE, RIGHT?
no ||get fucked idiot|| under my roof, children
exploitation is commonly an end result for the sort of stories we read, but that's because if you're running a narrative that's trying to be coherent and logical, you would expect a smart protagonist to break the system as much as possible in their favor
so it's more that exploitation of a system is possible and even common in such stories, but it's not a basal requirement
it's min-max porn
on a side note, i paused randomly on an rlm video and found a perfect depiction of this channel
CAPTAIN AMERICAAAAAAAAAAAAA

i never noticed this before, but after tayne there are two additional programs in celery man, they just aren't called out by name
"Cinco ID" and "Mozza-Rell"
i don't know why but this is really funny to me
misha's just weirdly knowledgeable about a lot of different things
also that's not true

it's almost enough to make me want to believe that linky bot is a real conscious entity
how do you think i was able to gain control of the server
i ripped it from makin's soul
it's like horcrux logic or something
i swear i'm not doing it on purpose
like, at one point i was afraid i was saying weirder things than usual just to give the bot more exotic lines, but i really am just this stupid all the time
https://twitter.com/RiegerReport/status/1252368438971871234
"We've been trying to take liability away for that."
jesus fucking christ
i don't know
i'm sincerely caught between not being sure how stupid he is versus how malevolent, or whatever combination of both
no reason he can't exemplify both qualities
i don't know how anyone can reasonably look at stuff like this and not be offended
"Yeah, despite the fact that there's a global pandemic happening where people die horribly from this disease, we're going to send you back to work. Also if you get sick at work, the company can't be held liable for it."
in fairness i've always been critical of the capitalist framework america revolves around, but how can anyone NOT feel that this is completely insane
well said
get with the pogrom???? holy shit nat racist
that's a big facet of this that bothers me woc
these people are protesting so they can go back to work making subpar wages for companies that literally dont' care whether they live or die
at what point do we call it brainwashing
no, i'm not
i'm not obsessed with numbers go up at the cost of other things
like, i still care about conversational quality to SOME degree at least, and i try to make sure that the people we already have feel safe and are having a good time
if i was truly capitalistic about this i would toss everything out except what makes those numbers go up as much as possible
i'm sure there's some optimal arrangement of this server where i could get the number of people joining to skyrocket
but it would also make people fucking miserable, so it's not worth it
i guess a more realistic example would be increasing activity in this channel
which would easily be achieved by removing our standards and moving it up to the top next to gen and altgen
we would experience a deluge of new users that immediately drop the quality of the place like a rock
not worth it
so tell me
would you like to go to dinner tonight
"my father just lost `a ratfic`"
OUCH
star wars posting has declined enough that i don't think that function is necessary anymore
no
they were smart and specifically made it not do that

DOES linkybot have a recency bias?
i have no idea what a mersenne twister is
you fucking kook
you mean the oot randomizer
i'll upload them tonight, i think i'm like 99% done with my thesis
if not, don't care because i'm so tired of working on it
moon, settle down
the rest of the world except maybe china has been much more effective at handling this than the US
if a country has sufficiently tamped down on emergent cases, then it might be okay to reopen for business as long as certain social measures are put in place
the united states is obviously a different case, the genie is kind of out of the bottle here
italy was pretty bad and the US is far worse
no, even per capita
states that are seeing these closedown protests are going to witness an immense uptick of cases and deaths in the coming month
moonjail the line going up is cumulative, the little bars on the bottom are daily
unfortunately, there's still plenty of potential for spread in areas that aren't new york city
they're predicting a second wave of infections in, i think, late summer/
as soon as people start opening up cases are going to skyrocket is the overall point
the problem is you guys are viewing this as a one and done thing, and both the graph that moonjail posted as well as krato describes that we're going to see numerous rises and falls in emergent cases
by "second wave" i meant the second big wave, like this initial shock of cases that we had at the beginning of the month
for what it's worth, i think that it IS something that's worth discussion, because in raw terms of "how many lives will be lost with this specific course of action," it's probably prudent to figure that out
but i also haven't heard any of this before tensei brought it up
why
yes, i was about to comment on that
most deaths during the great depression weren't from starvation, they were from malnutrition
which sounds like a pedantic distinction but it's actually pretty important
and for the purposes of this conversation, that's a highly unlikely scenario now given the nature of global food supply
i don't know anything about people starving to death in south africa
jesus fucking christ moonjail
do i need to draw on this with a fucking crayon so you understand what part of the graph we're pointing to
then how on earth can you say that it's linear
the cumulative curve basically doesn't matter, it's an accounting of total cases so far
the important part is the rate of spread, ie how many new cases each day
i am with you in saying that the rate of emergent cases isn't actually going to slow down or stop for the foreseeable future
but you are expressing your view in a confusing way by saying that the rate of _growth_ is still linear
it's not
you people need a fucking scientific education
part of science is also being able to express yourself succinctly and accurately
and from what i see that's not happening in this discussion
i keep seeing really weird and misdirecting/inaccurate assessments being thrown around and it's kind of tiresome
there is a deeper truth to this discussion but you guys need to be better at conversing with each other about it
repeatedly and viciously asking questions or asserting random pieces of information in service of your point does not help
adding new dimensions to the discussion apropos of little or nothing does not add to the discussion
moon, no one thinks you're a retard, people are confused because you're expressing your point incorrectly
like, i know what you fucking mean
but you keep saying the wrong thing
i already explained up above
the rate of _growth_ is not linear
the rate of total cases is linear growth
again, fine distinction, but important
actually i think it's pretty heavily indicated at this point, but it's hard to say because the disease has only been around for a while
if you're talking about long term health implications, then i think that logic can also be extended to what you were describing earlier with an increase in suicides
<@!131650004606648320> you really need to fucking calm down, you're getting worked up about this and i understand why but it's not really okay
go take a break if you need to
no, i don't think they're okay either
but i'm addressing you first because you are approaching histrionics
i'll kill it when i think it's beyond recovery
as it is i think this conversation is fine except for moonjail getting excessively pissed off
and tensei loosely slinging insults at people
i don't think it matters _what_ it is, you're trying to undercut an argument by casually tossing out something derogatory
in this specific case i agree that pointing out logical fallacies is a dumb move that doesn't really add much
but it really doesn't help the discussion along when you decide to mock them for it
would THAT be a whataboutism? <:thinkLoss:534542697634201600>
see <@!195290352838508544> that's how you point out a logical fallacy
yeah yeah, i'm just trying to bring the heat down a little bit
people are getting worked up and it's bothersome
mines, it's fine most of the time
this is just a really contentious topic
and as history shows us, tensei is eerily good at getting a rise out of people
it's like a refined skill practically
yeah, but now you're contributing to the being not chill factor
so take a break my dude
i break this principle all the time but none of this stuff is worth truly getting mondo upset over
being annoyed that you're not being taken seriously makes sense
that wasn't praise, that was an observatio
i have complained about him doing that pretty often in the past
you're still acting heated, can you please sit down
your grandchildren are going to need grandchildren lawyers
i need to get ketchup for my borglar
if i get back and you guys aren't being civil again, i'm freezing the channel
fix it in the next 30 seconds or else
tensei, when you have no issue with or even enjoy hacking people off as a side effect of your arguments, you are being a dick
this is me officially telling you to knock it off
<@!87363246360649728> i've only had burgers from the place once before but it was very good back then, they had free delivery and i haven't today so i figured i would indulge
i've never really liked it either, it just hasn't happened in a while
and also yeah, i was really hoping this topic could develop
i think that it's just too contentious in general
bringing up the idea of utilitarianism with regard to coronavirus is going to piss _someone_ off no matter what
because the merest hint of opening up too soon will make people angry due to causing a lot more deaths from the virus to spike
it's prime territory for people to get angery
wait, sh
what's that i hear
it sounds
wait, let me check this out first
oh it was a meme
anyway where was i
oh yes
DO YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?
IT SOUNDS LIKE
someone was at the door
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
yeah this is sucking up too much of my attention
we're gonna take a ten minute break
go have a drink of water or something you fucking wieners
take some deep breaths, stick an ice cube up your ass
whatever it takes to get your blood to cool down
this burger is great
one might even say that the ass was fat
if that doesn't make any sense, fuck you
dreeb can you split yourself into six guys so we can beat the five guys at making borglars
`yes`
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJtrHIMmMy4

https://i.redd.it/59iwm5sijcu41.png
yeah, it's kind of weird in retrospect
cel shading was deemed way too cartoonish and ugly
but wind waker is easily one of the better zelda games from a hindsight perspective
well yeah, it has the exact same kind of progression
BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
i think twilight princess was fine, it just didn't really innovate that much
the only thing about it that's truly new or different is the wolf link thing
and even that is debatable, because majora's mask did transformations
and it had more of them with variable function
OOT itself was basically link to the past but with an actual story threaded through it instead of just serving as a backpiece: it has the same overall progression, gain three pendants/spiritual stones to unlock master sword, gain crystals (amulets) to gain access to ganondorf
i highly disagree with regard to flow and music
but my POINT with this
was to say that twilight princess is basically just ocarina of time 2.0
get three pendants/spiritual stones/TWILIGHT MASK FRAGMENTS, unlock master sword (even though it's kind of tangential in TP?) and then collect crystals/amulets/MIRROR SHARDS
no, but that specific layout
like, obviously wind waker does that too but it's done in a somewhat different fashion
you collect two pearls, then go through this weird story progression that doesn't even involve a dungeon to get the third
i don't know, i would need time to properly word what i mean about the difference in gameplay progression
the overall point is that the patterns in story progression are basically identical in lttp/oot/tp
i don't remember skyward sword because i only played that offensive piece of shit once
then of course breath of the wild is really different
i really need to play through it again but that would require me to get a wii or wii u, which i have zero desire to do
i see screenshots of it now and i think it looks kind of ugly actually
i still don't like groose very much, but i think i'm coming around to him through meme value alone
the rest of my disappointment i think was with the gameplay obviously, and then especially the story
i'm kind of bizarrely obsessed with zelda lore, or at least i was at the time, so i was really looking forward to how each new game expanded the universe or fleshed out stuff
skyward sword basically took a massive dump on existing lore, basically ruined it in my opinion
the introduction of another goddess was not only unnecessary but kind of antithetical to the golden three
so like, fuck you, whoever directed that game
damn, must have missed most of those
but no, i swear there was someone else in charge of that decision
let me look it up
shut up
YEAH SEE
YOU FUCK
it was some fucker named fujibayashi
and to be fair, he also directed breath of the wild, which is great
but the lore is just less bad
skyward sword actively turned me off because of its story and how it just completely shat on existing lore
breath of the wild also does that to some extent but it's way less problematic, and because of when it's set it can and does properly pay homage to elements from the other games
i agree with that
***YOU FOUND ME****
`you got a korok seed`
do you want your shiny golden turd? FIND ALL 9 BILLION OF US
yeah, barkely
i think that's what it comes down to for me
gameplay loop of breath of the wild? completely fine
needs more distinctive areas or things to do though
i enjoy the environments, but you need some sort of _structure_
breath of the wild 2 i am insanely excited for
like
the one direct sequel for a zelda game we've gotten so far has been stellar
majora's mask is easily at the top of the list
you know what i was going to meme about phantom hourglass but i guess zelda has had a lot of direct sequels
for some reason my brain completely skated over zelda II and link's awakening
anyway, i really, really hope that botw2 turns out well
do we have literally any new information about it since that trailer
no wheals let me link the trailer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fr1Z07AV00
i wonder if making crusty ganondorf was a response to criticism about the mindlessness of the villain in botw
because like, calamity ganon is neat and all
but i miss dorfy
i mostly mean neat from an aesthetic sense
giant glowing boar was kinda cool
yeah, the english dub was super bad
the voice acting and the change in text are two separate issues, both suck
wat <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
oh, revali
i was like... "kass?"
but nah, revali was the only one of the champions who i felt wasn't awkward or embarrassing from a voice acting perspective
OOOOOHHHHHHH
OH MY GOD
***DARUK'S PROTECTION IS READY TO ROLL***
i mean, voice acting is something that had been talked about since like ocarina of time
i thought maybe twilight princess would have it before it came out, but now that we have it...
put it back in the box
why couldn't they put it back in the box?
we got jokes here folks
i was actually just fine with the voice acting once they updated it so you could switch from english to japanese
i don't have a problem with reading english text to a japanese voice
kind of nice even
but the voice acting is just.... so fucking bad
almost universally
i don't know how they fucked up that hard
"i have prepared a 108 page response to your so-called phantom menace review"
riju is the gerudo princess right
i'm pretty sure she's like a teenager or something
i guess conceptually it is a pretty weird character, but i didn't have any problem with her
it's perverts on the internet who are to blame
shut up nerd
we're talking about video games for kids
the world is too big for someone to NOT be weird about stuff
SEX
SELLS
this is borderline harassment
is that the soldier from TF2
what is this
no
i'm not into TF2
nope
i don't play TF2
okay, i didn't know that because i pay zero attention to TF2 related shit
now that i know the comics are good i will probably make an attempt to read them
t
not anymore, we basically finished up
i'm more than happy to keep talking about zelda but it feels like we've moved on
i'll get to it eventually
i mean
it's not exactly a good time right now
i'm literally in the last stages of completing my master's program
why are you always yelling at me
i was minding my DAMN business eating some DAMN fruit
the twilight princess zelda is definitely the most overtly hot i think
but i don't find her to be the most attractive
the meme answer here is "BOTW ZELDA HOOH BOY SHE THICC"
yeah, see what i mean
<:annoyedpepe:309825259820023809>
we didn't need an IMAGE
you sick fuck
but in seriousness, nintendo had to have known
like, there's no possible way they animated this and didn't realize how it looked
i have never played a splatoon game so i wouldn't know
aren't they all like kids
nah, doesn't work like that woc
reading homestuck is like a stain
it's a scar on your soul
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
```i'm not gay so whatever makes my dick hard is a woman```
when did homosexuality first start getting oppressed like we saw in the last few centuries
because we know that a lot of greek and roman societies practiced shit like pederasty
so was it like after the dark ages or
that's what you get when you take your eyes off chat nik
you gotta keep up
well yeah, that's fine
but i'm saying in general
STOOPIT STOOPIT UNCLE FILL
you don't talk to my wife like that
no. no!
"Sir, since we are now carnally involved, does this mean, perhaps... might I begin referring to you as... dare I say it, 'Heavy P'?"
really early and dangerous electrical designs are more interesting
there was one movie i saw where there was a small blimp that acted like an aerial ship with a crew and everything, and they went around in storms and "harvested electricity" using these giant metal nets
i always thought that was fucking awesome
so yeah, steampunk = tired
earlier electricpunk = wired, literally
teslacoils and shit everywhere
i'm not an expert obviously but WWI just seems like an extremely strange transitory period for the world
like, a huge mishmash of different technological competencies and cultures
i still think about FMA sometimes
there was a brief period of my life in middle and high school where that show made me interested in the history of alchemy as a pseudoscience
those seals look really neat
also i find conqueror of shambala interesting and kind of fun to watch, but after seeing FMAB a couple years ago it is indisputably better in so many ways
which is only to be expected because the manga was
you know
done by that point
i really, really hate anime or any show that starts too early and runs out of source material
so they have to guess or make shit up
negima did that TWICE
in the first negima show the asuka-lookalike is like
possessed by the fucking devil
in the second show i don't even REMEMBER what the deal was
<:bigHuskyForYou:599354144834453514>
i have discovered that hip hop tracks generally aren't suited for vaporwave
lofi yes
time to try dan hartman's i can dream about you
silence, fool
is it?
it's a song by diana ross
it's soft rock/pop rock
you fuck
"hip hop"
get the fuck outta here
also hearing the actual song after hearing floral shoppe so much is like, jarring
i like it though
she got a nice voice
andrew just has ~~SHIT TASTE~~ a different opinion
anyway, the point is you're wrong
floral shoppe is not hip hop you stank ass bitch
i'm trying to find an ideal sample
i don't even plan to do any real mixing
i just like how stuff sounds when it's slowed and pitched down
i did that last night with something from hall and oates, let me find it

i can easily envision taking like the middle two minutes of this and doing some loops or some shit
jesus, this is horrifying
saw this and immediately laughed
`this is the soundtrack to carbon monoxide poisoning`
these comments are fucking great
i mean, yeah, but the result is interesting
jesus, i didn't even think of that

the concept of the northern caves is really attractive but the execution leaves a lot to be desired
mostly the end i feel
i found myself getting bored when they were all trying drugs for fun, but the end especially is just like "what the fuck is happening"
and not in a surreal way like with modern cannibals
where i was confused about what was happening but there was clear dream-like logic happening
the northern caves is just a garbled mess
oh yeah, i definitely agree with that
the idea of getting this story that practically comes out of the ether
and it just makes NO sense whatsoever, but there are underlying patterns to it
that's fucking great
like i said, the concept is nice, i like the idea of a group of dedicated people getting together to look at this and getting sucked into some weird young adult novel plot or something
but then what even happens, it's been so long and i have a hard time remembering

yeah, at this point i'm way more concerned with discord as a service

reddit doesn't force you to use the app at all
oh, you're talking about looking at the website on a phone
i still don't understand how people can do that
it makes me want to bleed from my eyeballs when i use my phone for anything except basic stuff and discord
and even discord is stretching it

perfectionism is one thing
basic ability to convey an idea properly is another
only dicks give other people grief over minor errors or typos in a post
most of the hostility i see is when someone is using ridiculously illogical arguments or blatant lies
no, it doesn't
twitter by its very nature is prohibitive towards making good arguments because it forces you to either condense everything down into a really tight character limit or expend effort on breaking your argument into multiple pieces
which is _stupid_
what twitter does is force you to employ rhetoric that _sounds_ good because you managed to fit it in 240 characters
but is actually devoid of any reason or logic
or rather, i mean that it encourages that
this is why the idea of twitter clout is so integral to that platform
the people who have the biggest followings either start out that way with real life influence or they accrue it by being good at crafting what are essentially soundbites
i'm pretty sure that i would have run out of space if i had tried to tweet my previous message by itself
twitter is fucking garbage for anything except jabs and one shots

very wise answer
zeldablog
also have this delightful post https://i.redd.it/1rbxflrsbeu41.png
corvivivivivivivivivivivd
that is correct
btfo has always meant "banned the fuck out" to me
i think i'm just wrong
fuck
i'm done with my thesis for now
it is time
to do a steel soul run
it's about changes in soil microbial communities
basically, soil is really complicated
it's highly heterogeneous and the species that live in it make that complexity even worse
nah, it's a very specific set of conditions
application of composted chicken litter to pasture soils
this study was done on a large scale using metagenomic statistical analysis
the long and short of it is that there's a specific range of bacteria living in the poultry gut microbiome
so if you amend the soil with composted chicken litter, you should see those species increase in the soil too
also i wrote the thesis by myself but i did have help from a few colleagues
a phd candidate helped me establish the data pipeline we used to analyze our DNA sequences and run statistical tests on them
i also had an undergraduate helper who was fucking amazing at doing a lot of the wet work
yeah
because soil is complex it's hard to know how certain things will affect it
to the point that we weren't even sure if it's possible to consistently and repeatedly see the same shifts in soil based on what you do to it
thankfully this study shed some light on that
<@!133121291833049090> also yes
i mean, we didn't
we sampled soil from farms in northern georgia
field samples are always more complicated than stuff you do in-house anyway, was probably the most appropriate arrangement for it
ehhh
it's different depending on who you talk to
in casual use dirt and soil are the same shit, i guess dirt is just more derogatory
in scientific terms dirt is just loose dust and pebbles and sand and clay and shit
where soil has organic matter in it too
more or less
i should point out that dirt is called "regolith" in scientific contexts, not dirt
also yes andrew
i'm getting the stream set up
silence
streamlabs updating, fucking pain in the ass
yeah, go ahead and ask me anything you want to know about soil microbial communities
i won't be able to answer everything but i'm more or less an expert at this point
god damn it andrew shut up
wwhat borglars cy
that sounds uniquely terrible
cy, i wish you could have seen the look of pain on my face as that image popped up on my screen
it wasn't even like obvious pain, it was more just like my face started to cartoonishly droop

i'm going to post an example of stuff i see on reddit that's mildly annoying

the problem with this post is that it's a braindead take for most people
both "accusing someone of having a small penis" and especially because you don't like them is a categorically scumbag thing to do
i don't think that's an unpopular opinion
but by posting this on the subreddit /r/unpopularopinion, this dude is making it seem like they're in the minority
this is the sort of stuff i'm referring to when i say people blow stuff out of proportion or draw more attention to a topic than it needs
and i think it's one of my most hated internet behaviors
people manufacturing controversy in order to legitimize/broadcast their opinions
"I AM BRAVE FOR TALKING ABOUT THIS THING WHICH IS EITHER ALREADY COMMONLY ACCEPTED OR IS OUTRIGHT FALSE"
mission accompsiehdd
it's just tiresome
it makes me want to crawl into a hole and never come out
i'm not sure why this happens outside of people trying to farm karma or who are massively insecure about themselves and their ideas
or maybe they're taking an opinion of someone they disagree with and falsely suggesting that it's more common than it really is
thanks for the words of wisdom
the best faith interpretation of this i can think of is people who are severely underexposed to the ideas they're talking about
there's a distinction to be made here
porn in general is not seen as a problem
porn addiction is universally seen as a problem
the difference is in what people consider porn vs porn addiction
that difference seems obvious if you know literally anything about both of them
but to some people, any watching of porn constitutes porn addiction, and to some people none of it does
posts like that just serve as a sort of confirmation bias
really makes you think doesn't it <a:pensiveWobble:530000479401279490>

i'll try it out

PTU was one of my favorite ttrpg experiences
it's a shame it ended, especially right where we were
every single time PTU gets brought up i find myself frustrated with the lack of depth pokemon has versus what it COULD have

pokemon would be so great if there was more to it than the same shit it's been for the last 25 years

christ
will smith is a personality
all his best performances are when he's just being himself
sometimes literally
i'm reminded of the movie planet earth where he and his son go back and his son has to do everything
and there's one moment in the movie where he gets angry and starts shouting like will smith
and that moment is kind of fun? but then the rest of it he's a boring asshole
i think jaden has mellowed out significantly in the last few years, hasn't he
that's unfortunate
jesus fucking christ vappy is gone?
that's insane

thanks for showing it to me
we should watch the brave little toaster this weekend
all three movies
the video of the guy with all the charms on wasn't actually as interesting as i thought it would be
sad!
also, i got fucking tricked today
just now actually
usually i don't fall for these but someone came up with a fake trump quote and i wholly, sincerely believed it was real at first
```"And nuclear, we're gonna look into it, right? Nuclear with the atoms? It's amazing how much power those little things have. Much more than a teeny tiny little virus. People don't believe me. It's true. My uncle John worked with nuclear at MIT. Anyway, we're looking at it all including blowing it up. It's probably a cure, but we'll see. We'll see."```
```

    A question that probably some of you are thinking of if you‚Äôre totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs ultraviolet or very powerful light. And I think you said that hasn‚Äôt been checked, but you‚Äôre going test it. Supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way.

    And I think you said you‚Äôre going test that too. Sounds interesting. And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number in the lungs. It would be interesting to check you‚Äôre going have to use medical doctors with that, but it sounds interesting to me. And so we‚Äôll see. But the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute, that‚Äôs pretty powerful.```
you know the fucked up part? that one is real
i think it might be worse for the fact that it suggests people should drink disinfectant, which people will almost certainly do
started rereading wtc
enjoying it more quickly than i expected
swell of her tits is literally the worst part and it's gone really quickly
a small price to pay for salvation
why
is it because wtc is an outrageously complicated setting where any small collection of its elements would make for a dense tabletop session by themselves
maybe
for now i think i should stay away from games
i'm still not done with my degree, even if i'm close
i gave a short, casual version of my defense to my lab on wednesday
over zoom of course
my PI hasn't said anything overtly telling like "you're gonna get through this with no issue whatsoever"
but he talked about publishing the work when we have a little more data, and he said that he's really pleased with the information i've gathered
so i mean, obviously it's not shit
i also don't feel as dreadfully anxious as i have in the past about this, all of the information is coherent, internally consistent, and logical
oh shit
that's fucking terrible
oh, i see
you got saddled with one of those kinds of PIs
i feel for you, i've seen a couple of those around
yeahhh
as much as i complain/feel bad about this line of work, at least my boss is decent
you deserve better
dude that's straight up unethical
did you save any of that evidence
you could bring it to like a designated whistleblowing office or to a news source
that's super fucked up

i want to know what he thought of it
whether he thought it was stupid or if his part made him laugh
like, i just imagine zach hadel reaching out to mike and being like "hey would you like to voice a character in this short cartoon i'm making"
mike is like "sure, what's the character"

well, that's probably for the best
i don't imagine he would say anything that'd get him in trouble but at the same time, can never be too safe

the xylophone is so jovial
i need more of it in my life
i started my reread of wtc last night and this morning i was thinking about if it got popular and someone approached alexander wales about making a video game of it
and then i wondered if they would keep the same overall awareness of the story
because like
i would play that game in a heartbeat
shut up
you can't just speak the truth like that
i can feel my lifeblood seeping from my body
LURKING IN THE SHADOOOOOOOOOOOWS
you know, i've always felt like shia labeouf's tendency to be really extreme when he does public stunts was kind of dumb
but i have to give him credit
at least he's not afraid to go out on a limb
it's just too bad that along with his more artistic tendencies he's also kind of an asshole
<:SHIALABEOUF:532559243270946816>
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR CAR BUT YOU'RE ALL TURNED AROUND
i don't mean to be rude but i don't think you could capture the WTC universe with the same kind of tone that wales does
like, obviously
but it would tinge the campaign if you tried
make an original setting while using the same kind of system, imo
nah, the system is fine
or, well
it's mostly fine, obviously you can't get all of it yourself
but you also don't really need to, wales has provided enough information already
the setting is the more important point of contention
crunchy is a good word for them
the first and second chapters in particular are really rough
once you become more familiar with the overall premise, wtc is great
really consistently well written
yeah, that too
wales' writing noticeably improves over time
also yes, the last few batches have been fucking _insane_

this stuff is like transcendent madness
i can't fucking believe the sequence of events in human history that has led us to the existence of fesh pince
i think it was the my little pony part in particular that just made me feel like i was ascending into rapture
like, when you really, really take a step back and just think about what you're watching

in order to get the full breadth of that realization, imagine showing this to ANYONE in your personal life who doesn't use the internet regularly

oh, sorry, i was trying to rewind the video ten seconds
i know tera, that's how i find the best screengrabs
this doesn't count because i didn't use those keys but have it as an example anyway
pizza hut in the garage?
YOU BIG EARED _FREARF_
mint are you familiar with the majesty of fesh pince
ugh
the episodes with his father and will in the hospital from the gunshot are like
super serious
and there's value to that
but i don't know if it suits the overall vibe of fesh pince
like, we watched the lottery episode
also here you go mint
once you watch this, you will be successfully matriculated into our society
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeIkk6Yo0s8
don't worry if you can't get through it, it's all for fun
WAIT
IS THAT THE FUCKING JOKE?
BECAUSE I JUST HEAR MADNESS EVERY TIME
dude the gunshot one ends on a scene with him crying
it's fucking depressing
i've seen it on tv
there are so many little details in this video that just blow my mind when i really think about them
oh, then have no doubt
you are in for a time
but really
like, look at this

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM
IT'S IN THE VIDEO FOR LESS THAN 2 SECONDS
i am gobsmacked trying to wrap my mind around this
anyway mint, once you finish that there's a sequel
and then there's a few more ytps
if you're interested, let me know and i'll hook you up
a couple of them are standalone but then there's a large series of them based on king of the hill
integral HSD youtube poop list: fesh pince 1 and 2, RIGHT HERE AT YOUR FINGERTITS, prisoner 24601 makes a sandwich, then hank of the hill
that's actually pretty funny
what a fucking world we live in where people are impersonating youtuve poops in real life
i'm unironically stunned
what's that one spongebob youtube poop that's just completely unrestrained batshit insanity for 14 minutes
it's been brought up in here a few times
there are so many YTPs i haven't seen
ping me with videos, i'm going to go take a shower real fast
i'll watch when i get back
youtube poops that are over 3 minutes in length are 100% guaranteed to be either amazing or shit
nice
what are your initial impressions
that is a magnificent head of thinning hair
also mint unless you've started the second one already, here's a shift for you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7WtkdLQ6PM
i mean honestly, where YTPs are concerned we could go all night really
there's so many great ones
rimjoj kukacrack is great so far
SUUUUUUUUUUS
this is like borderline experimental
i liked the very end
good shit
spingebill is like a fucking nightmare
i enjoy it from an existential dread standpoin
this has gotta be by the same person who did the one i'm thinking of
i think my entire life has been waiting for the next thing that makes me laugh so hard that i have tears coming out of my eyes
that is what i desire
oh man, i haven't even thought about that
maybe i should buy some puts on chuck e cheese
is it even publicly traded
it used to be called something different
something something pizza palace
and was created by the same guy who owned atari
i want to
sometime
do not FORGET my name
heaven's like a cross between a dikekike video
and a
CHICKEN 'N WINNEGASH
<a:anumbersNUMBERS:394370289036820480>
we have plenty more YTPs if you're interested, but fesh pince is a lot ot take in
i'm just revisiting all of the ones we love so much
RIGHT HERE AT YOUR FINGERTITS in particular is a work of art
then i guess make it this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7WtkdLQ6PM
we can show you prisoner 24601 and the hank of the hill series another time
hm
i don't think so
oh, god
i can't stand those
they make the hair on the back of my neck stand up
fuck you
i forbid it
`their curiosity for learning has skyrocketed`
weak.
i was going to say, it's like
past 1 AM
i wouldn't object but i really shouldn't encourage myself to stay up so late
damn, you're in virginia too
this cursed land
i'm finishing up my master's degree at virginia tech this semester
BAH
of course you're on the coast
you and woc are so far away
i've been able to visit woc twice since i moved here
it's such a long drive
i'm from missouri so distance is all kinds of fucked up for me really
twice a year i go home to visit family, at a certain point driving distances just warp your mind into paste
got it in one
nope, you're right
it's a 14 hour drive from here to kansas city
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
you're going to need this after it's done https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoXu6QmxpJE
good god i am just losing my mind over here
jamming out to wang chung
this is the perfect night, really
YTPs, wang chung, alcohol
why can't life always be like this
YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER but yeah you're proabably rtight
cy where eve nare you
like
bah
i've met like ten people from here in real life
it's been a very pleasant experience every time
but that doesn't make it feasible to visit everyone
very sad
coronavirus shat on everything anyway, yeah
i'll visit venezuela when i'm dead
actually, i wonder if the conversion rate between USD and venezeualan money would mean i can afford a lot
money works like that right
well
i'm going to be here until the end of may
so if any of you in the area want to get a last minute meetup out of the way, be my guest
otherwise, i'm going back to kansas city to eat a shit load of bbq
that is ABSOLUTELY FALSE
virginia bbq has been sub par with exactly one exception since i moved here
there's a neat place in pembrooke called blue grass bbq that has had the only decent beef i've had since i got here 3 years ago
there's a place here called bottom of the stairs that sells """"""""""""""""""""""""""burnt ends""""""""""""""""""""""""""
they are like fat cubes with a little beef on the side
first time i ate them i wanted to throw up
these people wouldn't know proper bbq if it bit them in the testicles
maybe it's just the new river valley region of virginia that sucks
but like, the first thing i do when i get home is going to arthur bryants
the sauce is the biggest difference
virginia sauce is very thin and has low viscosity
because it's vinegar based
kansas city sauce is sweeter and thicker cuz it's ketchup based
and to be fair, i don't really like that
the bbq sauce is prefer is arthur bryants, which is thick but is very tangy and sour
it's so fucking good
yeah, that's good shit
arthur bryant was known as "The Rib King" when he was still alive
his sauce is emblematic of kansas city, the sweeter stuff is fake ass bullshit
it's tradition on my birthday to go to the original arthur bryant restaurant and get brisket
their french fries are hit and miss to be honest, and i don't think i remember what their burnt ends are like, which is a bad sign
but there's a wonderful place just west of kansas city that has the most magnificent burnt ends i've ever eaten
good god almighty i miss quality KC bbq
PINKIE PIE TIME
<a:ravecat:697287557272043561>
have a good night mint
glad we could exchange culture <:ree:475542526791516170>
i am down like sassy slamanders
as long as i don't have to drive
good god i'll have plenty of that to do
that is the worst fucking thing i have ever heard
i'm so sorry
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
i wonder how many things have died out that way mety
i think i could swing bella luna, assuming it's still open
my defense is scheduled for the 11th
so if it takes place after that, i'm sure i'll be down
THINK ABOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUT IT
<:dabeegMayahn:679423476268007424>
THE VOOOOOOOOOICE
THE VOICE
OF THE PEOPLE
it has tortured us for years
scarring the mind for life
Just a reminder about the track art anthology project: Unofficial MSPA Fans are taking applications to make fan art for each individual track on the new Homestuck album "Beyond Canon." Check it out here if you're interested! https://hsfanmusic.skaia.net/post/615587305515843584/beyond-canon-track-art-anthology-project-the-new
hey mint would you make me a sandwich
get viv some _cookies_
if anyone has an especially warm memory of carlton

```.... sex```
even at level 100 i don't think a single swinub can get through the elite 4 unfortunately
oh christ
is ben garrison still popular on a wide level or has interest in him waned at all
yeah, sounds about right
bill gates and his wife run a foundation that's dedicated to the eradication of a large variety of diseases across the world
which usually necessitates vaccines
anti-vaccine sentiment is rapidly becoming a mainstay of conservative policy, so naturally that means bill gates is their enemy
i'm still not sure if ben garrison actually fully and totally agrees with the stuff he draws or if he's self-aware and is just doing it for cash
actually i'm not even sure those are mutually exclusive
keeping an eye on the chat this morning, there are more people i want to talk about in SPAT than who i covered last night
man, is it possible
do i
feel my desire to write coming back
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
probably not, but maybe a little inkling
yeah it went up last night
just a couple of short entries
check the changelog
that command would be dead most of the time, i'm afraid
either way, just thinking of this story is making my skin crawl
you've brought this plague upon our houses
i guess i should get back to reading WTC again
only a few chapters in, i probably won't make it to the update
although a lot of these chapters feel much shorter than recent wtc
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
it's so easy to lose my faith in humanity these days
sexy times
whenever terrible things get said in here, this is exactly how i look
yeah but he's only bearded because of the CORONAVIRUS
GET THE FUCK AWAY WITH YOUR DEATH DISEASE
THE WALL EXISTS FOR A REASON
can you believe they're all like 40 years old now
they don't look it

the males are raised as humans because they're the only ones that deserve rights in this fucked up story
jesus CHRIST
why did this person write this
i wonder how many stories like this have been written throughout human history and were just lost/unknown because the internet didn't exist
how did you even find this
also like, is this for _sale?_ somehow?
`Self-published fiction makes me want to be dead.`
did you laugh to yourself when writing that ifnar
<:punctuation:473648526220591114>
i think this conversation might be in the top 5 worst subjects we've ever talked about
which is impressive
i mean, first of all
they all looked weird
second i didn't like having debatably sexual encounters forced on me, at least not while streaming
if i had been playing on my own i probably wouldn't have felt that weird about it
jesus
that was fast
yeah, sounds like it
i'll have dero get that update downloaded, hopefully
<@!146014279529791488> in fact i'm pinging you now, get that planetside 2 update downloaded so you can join us in the ship of death
i feel like i should put a moratorium on this topic soon
it's too weird for my tastes
also <@!120187484863856640> does wales want people to take note of typos or other errors in chapters he's already published or does he not care
oh
makin is caught in a game of tf2
fool that he is
somehow i don't feel like bothering him personally
i'm fucking astonished at how much i enjoyed misfits
kate from lost was constantly shat on by us for being uninteresting
those properties aren't mutually exclusive
BAD
ON
PURPOSE
i don't know, as long as the dialogue remains as weirdly funny as it was in the pilot, i would be more than fine with misfits as our next stream
that or farscape really
i liked them way more than babylon 5
well, i'm casting my vote for misfits then
contingent on tomorrow
i decide your _existence_
misha, when the show started i literally said "i already don't like this"
and then when they got their superpowers i said "i think i hate this show"
but then as it developed it just kept getting funnier
i think part of it is my absolute fascination with chav girl's accent
JOKE OF THE DAY TO MAKIN PORING
misha, you're being weird about this
simmer down my chad
that's fine, but you're being a cock
don't make me get the belt, youngster
fucking hell
i've got tears in my eyes from this conversation
today is a good day
tipsy, you've been to britain right
that's the joke you fuck heads
tipsy your response to it seemed kind of ambiguous now that i think about it, what did you think about the misfits pilot
<:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984> <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
misha's argument btfo
i'm losing my fucking shit
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT
i have to admit there's some value to this
you are just mad because you are angery
but nah, in seriousness, i'm just having a laugh
mate
wait, time out
flag on the play
traveling
misha are you genuinely angry right now
man, come on
that doesn't seem fair, we've had this go-about several times where you're making fun of me for being irritated
i've made my peace with it
nevermind, i retract my olive branch
you deserve destruction
i guess that's the very meaning of the word "taste"
it's possible to enjoy different things from each other
and you like the taste of sweat and dirt
i don't know why, that's all that came to mind first
anyway, we still have the shows for tomorrow to watch
we'll just have to see how much we like them
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
YOU GET
WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE
i wonder if seinfeld would be a good stream show
probably not
i'm vetoing parks and rec
i like that show just fine but it's too recent and mainstream, and everyone already knows about it
or has seen it i mean
agreed
that just makes me want to watch it more
no, like
in an ironic way
it's kind of like how i enjoy freddy got fingered
which can be watched on multiple different levels
that movie is fucking terrible on a basal level
but i can freely enjoy it because a lot of its entertainment value is in looking at it and going "how is this a studio produced movie"
there's at least degree of separation from you and the movie/show
similarly, from the pilot episode i wouldn't watch misfits and go "I UNIRONICALLY LOVE THIS SHOW, IT IS A WORK OF ART"
i would probably be laughing to myself at how fucking ridiculous it is
ifnar there's no reason to be a cock
people have shit that takes up their attention outside of this place
misha may be angery but he's not a loose cannon
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
viewers i think
which is kind of dumb
i was going to say
the weirdness comes from being alive for many thousands of years
at a certain point anyone is bound to go crazy from nostalgia alone
tolkien's elves are functionally immortal, right
nice
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
well, i can appreciate that
everything is alright, just don't do it again
<:kek:230307022598438912>
<@!213413608732884994> bitch i love you
ü•™
this leads to a point i've tried talking about with regard to fantasy in general
ie how common is that trope of having the main events of a story take place after some sort of cataclysm or slow decline
most fantasy stuff i can name off the top of my head has that
regardless of how emphasized it is
that's not really what i mean, i think
it's kind of like how in dark souls, the main events of the game take place after a significant period of decay where the great exploits and achievements of civilization are still visibly apparent, but all of the major players who made that happen are dead or dying
lord of the rings also largely takes place after the deterioration of men, where their race has become kind of low
yeah, sure
it's just kind of like the greek mythology set up
where the further you go back, the greater the people who lived were
the golden age -> the silver age -> the bronze age -> the age of demigods -> the iron age
and then i guess in the fantasy story, it's about overcoming a great and ancient evil even though you're in a worse position than them
actually with regard to lord of the rings i guess that's not true
the scale of power and military force that the forces of evil had were much greater in earlier ages too
melkor and sauron's physical forms have always looked really similar to me though
no, i know that sauron's armies were still in a better position than the fellowship and their allies
i'm just saying that it's reduced from how it used to be
and that's true of both sides
the forces of good and evil have both experienced a huge downscale in the amount of power available to them, like a natural deterioration
it's just that sauron did a better job of producing/collecting his troops
thanks doc
lmao, is that dr. manhattan <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
that's a great picture
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
this has been a wonderful day
manhattan's presence in the watchmen has always been really weird to me
i guess that's kind of the point, he's this huge fucking thing that complicates matters
fucking shorties
god
veli i find myself hoping often, fervently, that we learn some stuff about like minoan crete or any of the other bronze age civiliations in the mediterranean
i doubt the pottery shards we have now would really offer much besides accountings of livestock or grain or whatever
but i would do anything to learn real, concrete details about those civilizations
palace politics
it was just that the palace was the main shrine, so to speak, where the leader of the country or kingdom lived and ruled from
brap
i don't know anything about ancient civilizations and how chaste people might have been
i do know that rape was a much bigger problem back then
oh, lmao
yes, the farm effect
i already knew about that
i've also often thought about what kinds of neolithic civilizations and conflicts we will just NEVER know about ever ever ever
like do you think that at some point we had the equivalent of the gallic wars but with stone age civilizations
a highly underrepresented genre, sadly
i still need to read the bellum gallicum at some point
i need more ancient conflict crack
the quarantines have been weird in that my daily lifestyle hasn't actually changed all that much
i did go out a bit before but not too much
now it's just like
mandated
and i'm more or less fine with that
probably not
but it depends on a few things
first of all, i fully recognize and admit that my sedentary lifestyle is the result of some systematic problems in my life, and then externally it's because i hate where i am right now
second of all
i really enjoy staying inside
but i would probably go outside more if i was back home
because the people i love and care about are back there, and my gf especially is very good about getting me to go outside and do more things
being by myself out here, fuck it
no, i'm 14 hours away by car for graduate school
that'll be over in about a month though
thanks
my own personal enjoyment of the quarantine aside, i hope that other people have been able to handle it alright
shit sucks
doesn't sound sad to me, that's just how you prefer things
that's the biggest part of it all for me
is having the option to _choose_ what your preferred work environment is, or how much you want to work
i view a lot of jobs as a waste of time and energy
like, a theft of my time so that i can survive
but other people enjoy working
i'm not gonna begrudge people for liking being in an environment that requires them to put effort into stuff, sometimes that's necessary for them to function and feel happy
i do not feel that way is all
if universal basic income was a thing, i would probably never work a day in my life again
unless i got bored, which is a real possiiblity
what days in particular again
27th or 28th?
because i can put off moving until the very end of the month, just gotta know for sure
did woc say anything
man, you've got a long drive
you're not planning on going home the same day, right
you need lodging?
i've got a shitty pullout couch if that's up your alley
otherwise i could put some money towards a hotel for the night
solid
it's the first HSD sleepover guys
we're gonna make blanket forts, watch movies, and order pizza
that's a surprise tool that'll help us later
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
what about your moonshoes
<@!125433170047795200> don't just stare, say good morning
i won a bet against woc back in 2017 or 2018, and the prize was that he had to give me a hat that says "WOC is a loser"
it's my only hat
well, my only cap
i have a couple winter hats but that's my only baseball cap
sometimes
it is a badge of honor
this server has an illustrious history
that picture is old, just let me take a new one
DON'T JUST STARE
SAY GOOD MORNING
i don't think so nostalgic
mark the 27th of may woc
we're all meeting up to do
something
like, pizza maybe, i don't know
no you dipshits
cy would be staying over because it's a long fucking drive where they live
woc would just be over for a bit i presume
but yeah, cy brought up the idea of a hangout before i depart virginia for good
cy'll be spending the night at my place so they don't have to drive 13 hours in one day
they are
wait, why isn't cy on the sidebar
that's bizarre
die, filth
anyway, bella luna sounds good, but you still need to come to blacksburg
üî™
benny marzano's is great
you are fake and gay
bella luna is two hours away from both of us
which makes the plan automatically null and void
if that wasn't just a rumor, i read that china has sent three medical professionals over to north korea to advise
we talk a lot in here about deathism and how it's unethical to wish death upon any other human being, without exception
at a certain point though, i feel like you have to really look at who you're talking about
kim jong un is at the top of a large, complicated organization that causes untold suffering and dispenses death to anyone under their grasp who doesn't follow their orders
do you think it's ethical or appropriate to hope that he dies even with the aforementioned principle
i doubt that kim jong un is that thoroughly unaware of himself
he received top level schooling in europe
yeah, i don't recall that detail
inb4 tiny clone hitler
i don't know cy
personally speaking, at a certain point i think there's like a certifiable point where someone's existence is too much of a threat to the welfare and safety of other people in order to say you can't wish harm upon them
i don't know exactly where that point is, but
really, it's mathematical
on one hand you have the life of a single individual
on the other hand you have the lives of hundreds of millions of people
this isn't the whole deal where the suffering/death of the one person would lead to a utopic paradise for everyone else
it's a matter of "this one person is a menace and will actively make everyone else's lives worse for their own gain and pleasure"
in a situation like that, i think it's okay to wish death on that person
that's gonna be a yikes from me dawg
tankies, christ
<a:HyperNotLikeThis:520455961069223940>
i don't think that factors into the particular argument i put forth at all
i'm not saying that these people deserve some kind of karmic justice delivered to them
i'm speaking in very real, immediate terms of human suffering
vague and nebulous crimes do not need to have external observers say "this person deserves punishment"
but actively pursuing the death or torture of other people, especially a lot of them, is something that should probably be addressed or judged in a very real, tangible sense
like, should you just let a mass murderer continue in their activities unabated
no, that's ridiculous
north korea is a relatively undeveloped area with a shit ton of natural resources, i wouldn't doubt that idea
but i don't actually know about any real things concerning that
i'm approaching this from a different perspective i think, and if i stop to try and understand what you mean, i can get it
like, you're saying that even though this person would die, not a lot would actually change
and to some extent that's true, at a certain level we aren't talking about individual actions anymore and are instead talking about huge, complicated institutions
i was approaching it more from the idea of
"actions specific to a person that negatively affect other people"
and if i'm being charitable, then that's faulty reasoning when you get on a large scale
the example i mentioned of like a mass murderer is way more appropriate for the conditions i'm describing
where it's one person and not an institution who is responsible for the suffering of others
in such cases i think it's way more obvious what's right or wrong, although it's still complicated
with kim jong un though
i don't know
some of the things i've heard from survivors and defectors
reminds me a lot of world war II, after the surrender of germany
when soldiers from a variety of nation were going around and liberating places like auschwitz or buchenwald
and they ended up performing extrajudicial killings of the people who were in charge of them
which, yeah, that's legally inappropriate, but no one gave them grief for it afterwards
at a certain point you're dealing with human suffering and despair on a scale that is almost impossible to fathom
i guess i shouldn't talk about it, because there's no possible way i can understand how those people must have felt
i'm fairly uneducated when it comes to putin and the true extent of his power
is he being propped up by oligarchs or does he actually have control
that's completely reasonable cy
speaking of reasonable
woc's input earlier was valuable
it's unfortunate that we likely won't get another opportunity unless i'm out that way, but maybe we shouldn't have the visit
fucking covid-19
what are you talking about, i can speak russian
cyka blyat, that's all you need to know
right
oh fuck
i forgot to share the picture of "woc is a loser"
it's an ugly picture but whatever

oh no, i'm turning into rich evans
yeah
this is a basement repurposed into an apartment (i know, the jokes write themselves) so my head is like half a foot away from hitting the ceiling at all times
i can't jump in my own house or i put a hole in it
there's actually a dent in my ceiling in the kitchen, where i forgot not to do that
i was dancing when drunk
being tall is powerful
but with great power comes great responsibility
yes
no
yes
the long game, so to speak
also tipsy what you need is a tall strong and self confident man to lift you up on their shoulders and let YOU be tall and self-confident
strength can come later
the curse of your genes
it is kind of bullshit that testosterone makes us so strong
snaaaake eyyyyyeeeeeessssss
obese people who use those motorized wheelchairs to get around are the true failures
is shaq still physically active
depending on the level of exercise he does he might be eating WAY more than 3,500 calories a day
bodybuilders are going for looks, not actual strength
actually strong people just look kind of chunky
god, i can't fucking get over this doom crossing: eternal horizons music video
it perfectly encapsulates this crossover and how awesome it is
booooooo barkley, booooooooooo
what's the intended outcome
like, are you literally just trying to lose as much weight as possible
or do you need to lose weight while retaining muscle
because if losing weight is the end goal at the cost of everything else, then reducing calorie intake as a whole should be the focus
you could eat complete crap, and as long as you only eat so much of it you'll lose weight
but if you want to stay stronk then chicken is great
high in protein, low in the other stuff
<@!168980988477702145> hey friendo, we're starting on our way to rivendell finally
have you thought about joining or would you like to stay out

eternal horizons is easily one of the best crossover ideas to ever exist
but yeah, there's something viscerally satisfying about it
i really, really dig new DOOM
like, there's something innate to it that just speaks to me
i know rip and tear until it's done is a huge meme but like
yes
everything about new doom is designed to get your blood pumping, and it works on me like a charm
i have a good feeling about tonight
we're gonna make actual progress and break this rut
i'm getting more vodka
i've been tipsy this entire time
i told you i can function just fine like this
and yet you don't believe me
Sad!
i don't intend to get off my face
it's clearly inappropriate
i just like maintaining that warm, fuzzy feeling
barkley i actually kept my crystal skull
i named it bromeos
i pour my drinks into it
bromeos is an epithet of dionysus
it means "roaring," and refers to the boisterousness of people who get too drunk
which i felt was perfect for me, really
you got it
the fact that "bro" is in the name is just icing on the cake, really
i'm conducting a census of mspa-lit regulars for the next three days or so
as according to my personal, arbitrary standards
yeah
if someone comments that i feel is sufficiently active/old in their membership here, i put them in a list
as of today that list has almost 50 people
i don't think it'll get much higher, but that's pretty neat shit in my opinion
no, i'm not
i have a cut off of 1,000 messages sent in here though, and i roughly gauge if someone is active enough on a general basis to count
nothing's being asked, i'm just recording what i see
hm
i think i'll continue recording this until the end of the month, and then after that i believe i'll be able to establish some more objective parameters for who i can consider a regular or not
this doesn't really change anything, it's more for my own interest than anything else
WE NEED TO BUILD A WALL
man, sometimes i remember about how shakespeare is designated as a true master of the english language
and that washes over me, but when i read any of these passages it's like "yeah, that actually makes sense"
<:fatHusky:565631925935669248>
i just hope people keep coming here and talking tbh
aside from relatives and people close to me irl, this place is probably the most important aspect of my free time
nah
i'm just stating a fact
uh
reasons why i'm a lit reg: bepis
a) baaaaaaaah i make the borglar but then there's the five guys that open up and they make the better burglor. so i have to make six guys. gene, canju split yourself into five other people so that we can have six guys? `yes.` gene, if you split yourself into six people, what would it sound like? `AlLoW mE tO tElL yOu FaThEr. I hAvE sPlIt.  I hAvE sPlIt InTo FiVe OtHeR pEoPlE fAtHeR, nOw We CaN mAkE tHe BeSt BoRgLaR.` spare no expense, gene.
b) we are the burg. welcome. six guys, we are the burg. we shall... assimilate your flavor. resistance is futile. ***SPARE NO EXPENSE, DREEB.*** ```AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH``` hey, jake. do you believe in... in fate, or do you believe in free will? `i don't know father, i make the burgers. you ask me to make the burgers and therefore i make the burgers. in that case it must be destiny.` very good. that's my son. very pleased to hear that, drink. 

yours will be a life of servitude. you will never leave the borglar restaurant. for i am your god. you will not be fed. i will take you out of school, so that i have a free employee for the rest of eternity. `yes father.` tell your sister matilda to get in the kitchen and make some borglars with you, jeep. we need more employees. `yes, father.` me and linda are having another child so we have more borglar employees. how do you feel about this--okay, you know? ***BWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***

the song, for those who want it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ODKKILZiYY
plok is a shitty game with a soundtrack that is WAY better than it deserves to be
IT'S DESTINY, JACK
plok is basically a prototype of rayman
no limbs, only extremities
shut up,butch
no, really
in the game proper, you throw your limbs as an attack
each hand and foot
they just come off your body
i'm familiar with this track tera
it's quality
oh hey kitten
how you doin
glad to hear it
plok for next shill;
god, same
time for my annual viewing of tunak tunak tun
2013????????????????????????????????????????
jesus christ
when did plok first come out, the early 90s?
that's just how it is on this bitch of an earth
me and the gang playing lotro like
hm
i wonder
what in the actual fuck is this

apparently it's a "premium domain" so its value is much higher than others
i don't like the sound of that, but i can't actually find a listed price
it's probably thousands of dollars a year
"i will buy this domain for six dollars"
LOL
how the fuck does that even work
like, i don't understand how a domain name is owned and sold
that's because it's not a gag
i'm sorry to be the bearer of weird news
i already SAID THAAAAAAAAAT

internet culture is so fucking batshit insane nonsense
there's a significantly increased chance i think
i've never bothered to find out
except for one case, where i uploaded the entirety of the legend of zelda tv series
that hasn't been taken down yet
but i mean
i doubt anyone cares
so don't take that as evidence
that's fucking insane

it's not done processing
show me a screenshot
of the video as it appears in your google drive folder
not when you click on it, just in a list
it needs to be like a youtube video where it shows a thumbnail

like so
yep, it's not done processing
leave it be for about an hour or more
at least until it shows a thumbnail
it's advisable to prepare videos the night before, precisely because of this
you will know better for the future
that's all that matters
if you properly reencoded it, it should get done processing it within a few hours
i've never had a video that took more than a couple hours anyway
andrew's internet is just dumb
i'm making fun of you, idiot
uh
i think i'll join, but very, very passively
i probably won't even watch, but i'll be in the room
i;m not exactly in a very collected state of mind
i've been variously drunk for like 10 hours
sunday is my rest day, where i recover
```good god almighty. like back in the old days, you know, years ago they had, uh, A&R men that tell you what to play, how to play it, you know, whether it was disco or rock. but uh, we just told bruce that, uh, we want a straight edge jazz album, so we got all the fellas togethah. we had champagne in the studio of course, y'know, compliments of the, uh, the company. and we just laid back and did it.```
https://youtu.be/pYSrlygyhi4?t=2383
```jazz is the only thing that's gonna last. all that other bullshit, it's here today and gone tomorrow. but jazz... was, is, and always will be. we may not do this sort of recording again, and maybe not get the fellas again--george, uh, ron, greater taight, stanner turntene. so we hope you enjoyed listening to this album HALF as much as we enjoyed playing it for you, cuz we had a ball.```
god damn i love music
i am trying my hardest to find the original audio
spoken words by a fellow named matthew brenner
or dr. dreg
there's a profile on youtube who matches that name, but only two videos
and neither of them in the beginning or end match that line of text
which is fucking bizarre
take a spit on the internet
where were you ten years ago
i would rather die
i haven't typed out a full url since i was a young lad
internet
it's the nature of the internet spiral
acceptance of subcultures is way more prevalent here
than in real life, anyway
this sort of thing would have been beaten out of people in more typical communities if you went back 50-70 years ago
but nerd and then online culture especially not only made it acceptable, but common
it's a tradeoff, so to speak
the weird and unusual have become more prevalent
which makes it a strange environment for people in general, but it makes you think about how common this sort of behavior must have been throughout human history
woc, your continual presence confounds me
how have you not been slain by the forces of the universe by now
to be clear, i am extremely drunk by now
that should tell you all you need to know
oh god

<@!120187484863856640> Giddy Up!
bustin' rhymes and dispensin' infinite wisdom unto the people
barkley is correct
healthcare workers can and should be expected to do their jobs, but they're also people who have material needs that they have to take care of
expecting them to do their jobs at total risk to their overall health through inadequate supply of materials AND you don't pay them adequately?
that's a one way ticket to crumbling medical infrastructure
asking for them to continue working under conditions like that is basically slavery by proxy
if you don't get paid for your work, you're having wages stolen from you and you can't reasonably be told to work in those conditions
some people have no choice, but that's a different story
yeah, it's fucking mind boggling makin
the risk of infection is much higher, the actual deadliness of the virus is much higher than conventional diseases like the flu
that is incorrect
average deaths from the flu in the US per year is about 50,000, with 50 million cases annually
deaths from covid-19 starting from march 1st are already at 50,000, and the number of cases are orders of magnitude lower
yes
and also this is putting aside the intensity of the symptoms themselves
because half of the people are still going to get really sick, and a lot of people have no idea if they're infected or not
i haven't been able to take a test, both because they're severely limited in number and they're _expensive_
if i have the disease and don't know it, then going outside will result in me spreading it to everyone i come in contact with
yeah, that'
i think that accounting for the effectiveness of infrastructure is fair
or, well
that's a complicated idea, let me use a different example
south korea was able to completely halt the virus in its tracks and a death count ranging in like the hundreds
because they were proactive and took it seriously
i guess my point is that underestimating the virus has the effect of making its effects far more devastating
the actual mortality rate of the virus may not be much worse than the flu, if worse at all, but the other aspects of the disease make it much worse
disregarding specific cultural norms that affect how this stuff works, the genie is out of the bottle for america
especially when you have non-compliant morons in red states who are actively defying lockdown because they have non-essential stuff they're angery about not being able to do anymore
and also something about selling their souls to capitalism

wow
georgia, florida
texas
it's going to be very bad
i'm really hoping that their medical professionals don't just up and quit
because if that happens, a lot more people are going to die than were already
wat
teens can be and are affected by it, just at a lesser rate
there are plenty of symptomatic infections of people who are below the age of 50
i mean, potentially?
you'd still see a glut of people who need hospitalization
maybe significantly less, but also as said before it's unenforceable to specifically keep over 50s at home
and i'm sure many of them would still get infected anyway due to passive interaction with other people
we have to reopen sometime, but not this early
uh
why can't i access the ripatorium
i want to RIP AND TEAR
but i cannot rip and tear
i cannot rip and tear, father
yes
i didn't use the ripatorium for the most part while i was going through the campaign
so i played in there like six times in a row
yep, straight up can't use the ripatorium anymore
B3TH3SD4, F1X TH1S
yeah, true
this is extremely annoying but it's also not exactly gamebreaking
i just hope they put a patch out for it, i liked being able to go into the ripatorium for a few minutes a day and just destroy shit
this feels like a really dumb oversight
oh, hey
"restarting mission" when you're still in the fortress of DOOM resets the thing, so you can keep using the ripatorium
what a weird setup

the first part of the misfits pilot was not good, but it quickly increased in value after it started getting ridiculous
thath aving been said, if the show doesn't ever evolve, then that's not good
i mean, really
i didn't enjoy fringe as much as i did misfits, but it was a fine pilot
people shouldn't be angee if the show they like doesn't get chosen
the more important part of all this is just enjoying a show together
i think it's more than possible for me to enjoy fringe in a group setting, more than i would if i was by myself
ree ree, etc
it's going to be fringe
you probably should have had it as like ranked voting
so that everyone can vote for whatever they'd want to watch, and then you just go with the one that has the most votes
as it is you have it so people cna only choose one, which makes it harder to figure out what the MOST people want to watch
misha isn't actually being a sore loser/winner, he's just memeing
he's memeing like a turd, but still
because it's about eliminating losers each round
in the first round you have three choices
the one with the least votes is pushed out, then you have the second round
i don't know why there's a third round in this one though
done
no, i kind of agree with makin in a way
like, attention to detail wouldn't make or break that show
but it reveals what kind of mindset the creators had when they were making it
attention to some details over others for convenience's sake doesn't bode well for the overall quality and progression of a show
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i'm more than fine with fringe winning
a lot of people enjoyed it
we'll get to farscape and misfits eventually
but not expanse
because fruck expanse
misfits, dingus
anyway, did you watch it iwth a group or by yourself misha
because i can't imagine watching misfits on my own, personally
ah, okay
no
don't
half the fun of misfits was being completely caught off guard by some of the shit they were saying and being unable to understand their thick ass fuck accents
i was fine with nathan's performance, but only because it was able to maintain that level of separation between myself and the show
it's kind of like gord in freddy got fingered, like i said yesterday
it's just that nathan is less immediately outrageous
no he's not you fucking idiot <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
we're probably going to watch it at some point, and you can't stop that
you're free to not watch it with us
okay, ifnar
that's it
you went way too far
yes, you've gotten good at pushing the line in the past but that was WAY, WAY out of line
mspa ban for the rest of the evening, think about what you've done
SHAME
i think that altercation whipped me out of like a reverie
this entire day has felt kind of cloudy
and then reading that was like emerging out of the surface of a pool
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
makin, it was a fine pilot
i wasn't enjoying it but it had its attractive qualities
i'm pretty sure that our total viewership was around 30-35 unique individuals
how many participants are in the poll

SOUNDS LIKE

see, i was going to say
spears sound highly underutilized in general
a very point thing you can attack people from a distance with?? what's not to like
sorry, wrong word
i mean that they're underrepresented
in modern fiction
who needs sharpness? just defeat your enemies with sheer blunt force alone
cave their armor in
i have a dumb soft spot for the kind of curved blades that vin deisel uses in the riddick universe
the ulaks?
they look so fucking impractical but also pretty neat
escape from butcher bay and assault on dark athena are genuinely decent games, all the more miraculous based on how dumb their source material is
i've played them both like two or three times
the only good movie is the first one
chronicles of riddick and then riddick are both fucking terrible
the last one in particular is like offensively bad
also before anyone yells at me i'm using the word "good" liberally, pitch black is a kind of mediocre movie with a few elements that are pretty fun
no, it's definitely not as bad as the doom movie
but that's not a very high bar
sometimes i'm not sure how much of a meathead vin deisel is
i wouldn't even say he's a bad actor, i think it's more that he can only be typecasted properly
he doesn't have the range or charisma that the rock does
fucking christ, the pacifier
<:punctuation:473648526220591114>
:sial
fuck
whatever
but yeah, i have a softspot for the riddick universe
the animated movie that takes place between pitch black and chronicles of riddick is also really fun
wait a second, what
tarty the fuck are you talking about
***ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?***
john cena is really self aware even if he would be counted as a bad actor
and he also seems like a really good guy
SIAL
tarty i'm still confused what you were talking about with that paragraph up there
yes
i'm intrigued
is the chronicles of riddick even available on VHS
when did that movie come out
holy fucking crap
i didn't realize the movie was that old
it feels like something that came out in the early 2010s
yep, you can totally get it on VHS
i think i've heard of this sort of thing, but only vaguely
probably a shame thing, yeah

me trying to wrap my mind around this cartoon
yeah i'm watching code lyoko
we're on episode 39
season 1 had a lot more filler, it was frankly outrageous
i like it when there's actually some sense of progression
a lot of season 2 has been interesting
i'm not watching it with anyone here
earlier
started airing in 2003
ended its run in 2007
hell no
i can't stomach even looking at it
did they ever give up on that live action crap
thank goodness
CANNOT

<@!125433170047795200> update on the fleet carriers in case you haven't seen it https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fleet-carriers-beta-1-feedback-changes.542193/
they're also adding universal cartographics
tritium is 2x more effective as fuel
prep time for jump is now 15 minutes, and cool down is only 5 minutes
frontier addressed all of my concerns
i am fully back on the fleet carrier train
and dero brought up something very interesting that a fleet carrier will allow us to look at
```Cygni X-3 is an unreachable x-ray source located in the Cygnus constellation. It is a dual black hole system with a B class star, and the B class star is being eaten by one of the black holes. This system has beyond fascinated me and my journey has stopped at anything to do with this constellation. Ky Cygni, Cygni X-1, you name it, I am going to it, or getting as close as we can.```
38,000 LY from the bubble
literally only going to be reachable with fleet carrier jump range, as it's a bit over 400 LY from the nearest reachable star
so i don't know about you, but i know where i'm taking my ship
10 mil a day _base cost_
er, 10 mil a week
with all upgrades purchased it was 144 million a week
now it's like 15 million a week with all upgrades purchased
which is still rather exorbitant and kind of stupid, because these should ostensibly make you money instead of being a money sink
but that is WAY WAY more manageable
yearly upkeep of a fully upgraded fleet carrier is approximately 1.123 billion credits
which is pretty steep, but if you're willing to put in a bit of grind then you can make that work without issue
a year is a long time, even if you plan to take a huge break from it
```If we have the ability to get a ship out here in the future that can jump 417 light years, then we can reach it. For now, I am among 8 others who have put their name on a body in this system, and I begin my long trek home...
And hopefully have enough FSD boost materials to do it. This little Diamondback Explorer has seen so much. She didn't make it back from Sag A*, but I am determined this time I will get home.```

damn, you know what that means

i've heard of it but not bothered to watch it
horrid
it instills a sense of fear and dread
boy do i feel that
everyone in here knows my real name already so it's not that big of a deal
but i always worry about malicious people out there
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
there's always that one filthy mcrotten dude out there
i'm not saying i'll likely be targeted but i'm not exactly going to make it easier
i need to get back to reading wtc
i've figured out my mining strategy from here on out
yeah i'm bred man
in baguette we trust, etc
i wonder if i still have the original pic laying around
would you look at that https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/310692219348713472/374398198011396100/disgusting.jpg
for those who might still be unfamiliar: i was visiting a friend in canada and stayed at their apartment for a couple weeks
at some point i thoroughly lost my mind and reverted into a feral animal
not only am i ripping into a baguette, in the other hand i have a plate of homemade french fries my friend made
that was a really weird time in retrospect, i barely counted as a human for a couple days
god, i fucking hate that clip so much
i really do
it's probably the least funny one
no, it's terrible
i'm never drinking heavily on stream again
what's the other one
oh, that one is less bad
i just hate the other one because my voice gets so shrill and it's just overdone
but
did you not?
i watched that stream
having the OSTs of completely unrelated games in the background of silent games is something i need to utilize more often
when i stream anyway, i think i'm going to end up taking a break from that for a while so i can focus on my own stuff
there are like four things i want to accomplish and i'm making little progress on all of them
i really need to try writing more for SPAT especially
there are enough things that happen here that it deserves mention, but i'm just so unmotivated
i've always been a lazy piece of shit but quarantine has somehow made it worse
which is impressive, really
nah, i'll have to get to that tomorrow or sometime this week or sometime in may
i would rather implode on myself and cease all external functions forever
nedroid is a valuable treasure, especially in these dark times
i'm sorry to hear about your dad mines
hopefully he and you will all be alright
welcome to our humble abode, who are you
ah, nice to meet you
also, lots of people necessitates lots of places for people to talk about specific stuff they want
if you crowded everyone in the server into one or two channels, it would be a complete madhouse
i take offense to that
i'm a weeb gamer loser, get it right
yep
hopefully regular episodes are shorter, but i don't know the total length of the series
probably fucking huge since makin likes watching us suffer
is this explanation inspired by me saying "mem" earlier
haha robots go whirrrrrrrrrr
we should watch that new cats movie
i want to be traumatized by poor CGI feline butthole
oh, it's not even funny bad? that's a shame
are you absolutely sure
that's really a shame
woc how could you utter such slander
shrek the musical is a priceless work of cultural art
it deserves to be enshrined forever
people in the rest of the band being off key or especially off beat always made me want to die
i hated it so much
part of why i couldn't really stand being part of band after high shcool
i'll find you one later, remind me tomorrow if i forget
also woc i fucking love this corvette dude
there are few things as satisfying as dropping into a ring to mine as usual, then pirates show up to harass you
and usually i have to let them go because my mining rigs aren't big enough to carry weapons
but in addition to the full complement of mining gear, i also have two size 4 multicannons and a size 3 pulse beam
so i just fucking instantly waste them if they're below like dangerous level
elite dangerous is fun
there's typically a third pass, from what i remember
the secrets of the universe have been laid bare before us
what were you going to send
if it's too bad send it to me in a DM or something

I FUCKING this joke is tired
no way, it's great
i'm rereading it now, on chapter 15
why is mike so memeable
do you think it's because he's acted in homemade movies for an untold number of years
and he knows how to specifically manipulate his face into a particular expression

i was thinking about it just now tera
but there's a not-insignificant chance that red letter media is the reason fingertits exists
also THAT'S FUCKING CURSED GET IT OOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
anyway, the best of the worst where they got "family guide to the internet" came out in 2013
fingertits was made less than a year later, in the middle of 2014
it's not a 100% thing but the timing is auspicious
DON'T ANSWER
`JUST KIDDING GEEZ`
oh no?
my opinion is worthless here, so i abstain from the conversation
i actually really, really hate the kim yo jong memes
or i guess it's less the memes, though they definitely suck, and more the people who are openly praising her for probably mantling the title of supreme ruler of north korea
like, taking her rise to power as empowerment of all women? what the fuck is wrong with people?
improper usage, you're right
mantle as a verb is what i was going for
it's weird english, nevermind
not worth hashing out
either way, she fucking sucks too and people unironically supporting her just because she's female deserve to be shamed
i don't know how common a behavior it is, but let me find an example of what i'm talking about
this is surprisingly hard because i don't use twitter, so navigating this nightmare of a shit fuck website is kind of irritating
oh yeah, you wanted something from me
i'll get to it later
anyway i'm mostly talking about the kind of people who are posting pictures of yo jong and saying shit like "queen üî•" "slaaaay" unironically
thankfully it seems that there's been backlash against it in the time since i first checked, so i'm mollified somewhat

Fringe won the <#184908151185866752> battle to become our next stream show, so starting this Friday we'll be watching the entire series each weekend. If you're interested and want to watch along with us in a big ol' group, ask me or one of the mods for the Fringe stream role and we'll slap it on. I highly recommend joining in, it can be a lot of fun!
it's kind of like if someone had a dakimakura of adolf hitler and they called him "hitler-kun"
it's not quite that level but it's in that direction of fucked-upness
i mean, it would be funny if it was done explicitly as a joke
but these people are being serious
it's not to be encouraged or tolerated
this is making my eye twitch
i was going to ask another question about wtc but we have a discord so i'll just go there
wow
tomato, i think you may have accomplished the opposite effect on me that you intended
i went into this expecting the worst shit fuck thing i've ever seen in my life
and then ||all of the dialogue i saw with john was acceptable bordering on actually entertaining|| and i was like "wow, this update is actually pretty decent once you get past the start of it
but then
but then
this update felt like descending into a waking nightmare
it's kind of like how everyone was super angry about the epilogues and how they took a huge dump on existing stuff, but i just found it kind of amusing in a perverse way
except it's ten times more perverse now and i'm no longer amused
if they were trying to emulate the feeling of how fucked up the candy timeline is they succeeded handily
cheese knife
that is kind of the function of the prattles, yes
reading this update was like descending into a nightmare
i enjoyed a lot of the dialogue that involved john
the stuff before meeting up with john on the tower was tiresome and gave me uncomfortable "vriska back in the spotlight AGAIN" vibes
everything after it just filled me with a sense of abject horror
keep the dog dick memes to a bare minimum, or even better don't say them at all. people who are being overly crass or edge into offensive territory will be banned

benny, we're being punished for liking something
this is what it means to suffer
man, like
the dialogue between john and harry anderson was actually great? i found myself thinking it was cute and enjoyable
then rose and kanaya showed up and i wanted to die
i don't really care about yiffy aside from the name
it's entirely likely that jade and rose having a secret daughter was in the works from the beginning
i mostly hate the name, which is absolutely shitfuckingly ridiculous
and i especially hate how this information was conveyed to us
i just feel dead inside
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
this is my face irl
fuller, i think that it's a very real possibility they'll rely on prattles for imagery that's particularly intense or difficult to draw
is the reaction to this update comparable to reactions to updates back in homestuck's heyday
like, i know that they could be controversial and intense
but this is like
surely the nature of this content makes it different
yeah
i think i might actually be done guys
i think i've officially given up on the possibility of homestuck 2 becoming good
"All Cops Are Bastards"
yes
`Homestuck 2 makes me want to be dead.`
i think i've completely abandoned all semblance of care for its quality
i've primarily been sticking around for this community as it is, so that's not a huge change
but now i just want to see how big the dumpster fire can get
or some kind of fucked up dog human hybrid
presumably the doggy dick is all dog
i regret encouraging this
stop talking about jade's doggy dick
yiffy is real
bye everyone
nah, i'm not that wacky zany
yet
that's what i said earlier carl, yeah
the actual existence of an illicit daughter between rose and jade doesn't actually bother me by itself
the problems i have with it are the name and the way they executed the idea
both of which are categorically awful
proceed
because i've lost control of my life
i guess this is what people mean when they say nothing is sacred

someone is reporting all of these guys comments in the update thread and flagging them as disrespectful
but with a couple of snarky exceptions, they're fine
SOMEONE is taking this too seriously
i'm amazed at how thoroughly this sapped the energy out of my body
i just want to take a legendary nap
zent, the update itself was not fun at all
i got all of my enjoyment talking about it with people
the reactions were 100 times more entertaining than the content itself, which while not unexpected is kind of a problem
you ever just feel your lifeforce draining from your body
viz apparently fucked up music
and they aren't updating the website
so viz isn't really good either
oh god, right dingus
more evidence in the flanderization pile
fuck, i hope dero downloaded that updat
e
Ree Ree, etc
fuck, i wouldn't even mind vriska being brought back to the fore for the third time, if there was even the slightest indication of a change in her mindset
a tiny eensy weensy nudge of doubt perhaps about how sure a thing her relevance really is
but there's no subtlety here
because she's been put on the sidelines, effectively out of relevance, no less than twice across two realities
you'd think she would have learned ANYTHING because of that
anyone who says that authors can't become out of touch with their stories and characters is full of shit
death of the author gang for life
funniest shit i've ever seen
got me good
my consideration for that idea is unironically more than zero
stop talking about horny, christ
i don't want to get it, either
stop talking about it
STOP TALKING ABOUT IT IN HERE
i'm pretty sure that was after the update where we first heard of "yiffy" moon
the... one where jade says "they took yiffy"
i don't really get it either tera
i was willing to _accept_ that people liked her so much, but it's getting in the way of quality
get rid of her already
she's narrative deadweight
i mean that in general too
yes, i was kind of waiting for it
like
"did they just actually get her"
nope, it was the prelude to a vriska is badass scene
you know what would have been a really neat way to distinguish vrissy's character? have her be _appalled_ by the violence and resolve to be less like vriska
that would be interesting AND make her have a more unique character
yeah, if i don't take this seriously at all, then sure i can enjoy it
but that's not something you should aspire to for your story
homestuck had and should have the capacity to be taken seriously
no, cy isn't necessarily correct
they're just the person who wins the most
the rest of us are suffering because we actually kind of care
important difference
it's correct if your angle is just to get maximal enjoyment, you fucking stooge
that's kind of what i'm saying
the rest of us are trying to give a shit about the integrity and quality of the story
holy fucking shit negadrew
that singlehandedly made me fucking cackle
just thinking of <:CursedTav:296445435386658817> showing up totally unedited, no one comments on their appearance
accepted without question in-story
fucking got me good
in the way that cyrene suggested, yes
i'm straddling that line where i think homestuck 2 literally can't be good good at this point
but i think that homestuck 2 could possibly be bad good
like, funny and entertaining
if i switch to that mindset, then absolutely yes it would redeem this update
but i don't really want to give up that last vestige of the idea that homestuck 2 could be a quality work of fiction
jade, stupid question
fucking christ
the more i think about it, the more willing i am to give up homestuck 2 as long as i find its progressive updates funny
if this could somehow turn into the The Room of webcomics i would be completely fine with that
shut up fat husky
yeah, what in the actual fuck is this person on
how pants on head stupid do you have to be
how did politics get involved here
i'm not sanctioning this today
<@!343831026373623808> knock it off
don't drag politics into this discussion
i also want to point out the formatting
where in the first half of that prattle it's centered and then the second half it's left oriented
which is a minor complaint but still
fleegle
of all the words of pen and tongue, none are sad as these: woc was right again
have things slowed down enough that i can disable slow mode or reduce it at least
or is this place still hell
i'l leave it at 10 seconds between messages for a bit then
i don't necessarily think that's a _better_ way to approach enjoyment of a story
but i do recognize that's a valid way to approach stuff
i prefer stuff that actually like
tries its best though?
well, that's putting it rudely
i prefer stuff that tries to take itself seriously
that goes both for genuinely good stuff and so bad it's good stuff
that's different from a commercially produced story, qweq
or a fanfic even
i don't enjoy stuff that's purposefully silly unless that fits its genre
god, hold on
i'm not explaining myself adeqautely
i'm playing a game
sever
anyway
let me try and explain what i mean coherently
i don't think i actually have real expectations for something except that it does whatever it's trying to do well
WITH THE EXCEPTION of so bad it's good shit
because that's a totally separate deal
but a story or whatever can be good no matter what it decides to do, it's just a matter of the details in the execution
the thing that's aggravating here is that i can kind of tell what homestuck 2 is going for but i don't think it does it well
and even if i'm wrong about that, it's not well executed in general so it doesn't really matter
and by well executed i specifically mean that i don't find it entertaining or enjoyable in a lot of respects, and all i can do is try to explain why i feel that way
does that make sense
<@!348596696797806594> trust me, i understand the irony
done
yeah, and like i said before, that's completely fine cy
i'm not trying to imply the reasons you enjoy it are invalid
but due to what you said too, where homestuck has huge analytical potential, that's the part that i really liked about it, as well as like
some general entertainment factors, like having really great multimedia components
and the ability to elicit really specific emotional impacts
i think a good example i've used before is uh
those moments of "epicness"
which really commonly come through in flashes
homestuck was A class in giving me the feeling of frisson, y'know
or even just feelings of great sadness and inspiration
homestuck 2 hasn't hit any of that for me at all, so right off the bat i'm worried
it's been pointed out that the comic is fairly early in its story, but we've been at this for like half a year
yeah, that's fair
i think the story in homestuck is fine, but the thing is that it's actually pretty multilayered
and i don't mean that there are several different pieces to focus on, because that's true of homestuck 2
but like, homestuck proper had lots of different levels to its story you could look at
where you have not just john and the rest of the beta kids, then the trolls have a fully contained story, then there's the conflict between the two kingdoms, and all of these things have elements that directly impact each other AND are self-contained
it's a wonderful mish mash of stuff that all works on individual levels but still meshes together quite nicely
homestuck 2's parts, so far, are all pretty separated from each other
i assume that'll change, but still
john, i'll get to it in a bit, i'm almost done with this game
why am i not surprised to see revlar still spewing vitriolic garbage
at least he had the decency to remove himself and spare us the trouble of banning him
rosemary fans being upset about this solely because it ruins their ship is on par with people getting supremely upset with the epilogues because dirk turned out to be the villain
it's kind of a weird avenue for discussion and i don't really want to entertain it
the thing with rose, jade, and kanaya in this update is like
you need your characters to behave with some internal consistency or else they're not relatable
this update had them do/say stuff that is just not within the expected behavioral set for them
and that can be fine
BUT
you need to justify it in one of two ways
1) you need to provide some reason IN THE STORY that explains why they're suddenly deviating from expected behavior
2) i forgot what i was going to say
yes, barkley, precisely
even just a single throwaway line justifying the behavior
because otherwise it's fucking confusing
anyway, like i said earlier today, i think i'm teetering on the edge between "try to analyze homestuck 2 seriously" and "fuck it, just accept it as dumb schlock and try to extract some joy out of it"
maybe if i read this latest update again with that latter mindset then it'll slap differently
same barkley
it's a peanut gallery experience
which is why this place is great, it's way easier to share in that
but it doesn't bode well for the future of homestuck or its adjacent propertie
i don't want to just make fun of homestuck
i want it to be successful
i don't exactly like dispensing harsh criticism, it's not something i gain some kind of perverse glee from
but fuck
what else am i supposed to do
i call people fake and gay anyway but only my friends
so they know it's cool homie
welcome back gnawms
good to see you
turn it up

just don't talk about snakes in any capacity and you should be fine

stop talking about being scalies, i command it
do you regret coming back yet
time to start reading the WTC update finally
man
mines, was it you who mentioned wtc earlier
specifically with regard to how alexander wales is writing it out of a love for RPGS
who said that shit
because the more i analyze this stuff from that angle, the more i agree with it
the dude has obviously put an insane amount of time into thinking about tabletop games and how to make them as fun as possible, or as interesting
a lot of the concepts he throws out at times i have never even thought of
no yeah, i owuld unironically be interested in a tabletop RPG of this
but it would have to be DMed by the right kind of person
why the fuck is this good news
i think that's also why WTC is one of the better rational fiction stories out there
is because it's coming from a place of genuine passion and understanding, rather than veiled pretentiousness
something like HPMOR is also made because of appreciation for the setting and material, but it's also a way for the author to flex their smartness muscles
also true john
i mean, ratfic in and of itself isn't a pretentious medium
it's just that it attracts the kind of person who is very full of themselves
and it shows in the quality of their writing, should they make any
that's why WTC is good, it doesn't have any of that pretentiousness
it's literally that joke about how running a tabletop session with yourself is just writing a story, except he actually did it and he's doing it _well_

what is there to do a disservice to anymore
everything is already ruined forever
no, andrew is correct
the other people on the homestuck 2 team may very well like the epilogues too, but aysha is the only one who contributed to it in any concrete fashion
wait, fuck
lalo wrote for the epilogues too?
nevermind, i'm completely full of shit then
get fucked nat

<:squinting:538174601146925066>
i will answer one (1) question, young one
i think he's a fine joke character, or at least as fine as any of the other dancestors who saw no narrative time after meenahquest
that having been said, i don't think i enjoyed anything about himself necessarily
most of my enjoyment from meenahquest came from seeing interactions between characters, but those characters don't really have much going for them individually
that's not to say they don't have the _potential_ for that kind of thing
it was just never developed beyond a basic concept
and that's fine really
injecting more characters into the comic at that point was asking for death
jane didn't suck as a person but now she does
and she's _always_ sucked as a character
like, literally, sucks all of the interest and fun out of whatever situation she's in
jane turning into an evil dictator would be perfectly fine IF it had been built up to properly
like, interacting with one or both nannasprites would be a great example
let's say that jane starts having niggling doubts about what to do with certain problems
she doesn't go straight for troll genocide right off the bat
then she starts teetering in that direction, but nannasprite(s) is like
"young crocker, this is quite improper, hoo hoo! you shouldn't subjugate an entire species because of inborn prejudices and false conceptions of leadership!"
and jane is like, "of course wise grandmother egbert, that makes total sense"
but then something forces her hand, and she does it ANYWAY
and nannasprite(s) is disappointed and withdraws from her younger self, and jane steams ahead with confidence
except for one tiny part of her brain that still recognizes what she's doing is wrong
that's called "depth" and jane doesn't have any of that right now
yeah, that's probably why nannasprite would try to talk jane out of becoming a condesce figure
they tried to give jake a little depth before the comic ended but it wasn't very well developed
i think the reasoning for it was fine, this kid who grew up in isolation suddenly thrust around a shit ton of people he doesn't know at all
but we didn't see enough of it
and also jake's underlying personality has always been YEEHAW PARDNER GIDDYUP BUCKAROO ***BOOOOY HOWDY***
anyway i take my leave from injecting my bad takes into this channel, have fun talking
terrible
just terrible
that's actually down from last night
it was around 2,180 just after the update dropped
not a substantial decrease, but usually that number only goes up after an update
it's worth it, and wales deserves it
i'll start freezing the channel if i see furry shit too much
which we have admittedly been getting very close to
not gnawms' fault either
so shut the fuck up y'all
i mean
i saw it on reddit
oh, do you mean to my fuck huge forum style post
i think cy might mean ethically
oh jesus christ
over 13,000 messages in the homestuck channel today
that update riled a lot of people up
in:homestuck
oh
god damn it, sorry
i'm taking stats
so like 1 2 and 3
no other soulsborne games
depends on what they're looking for
dark souls 1 has the best treatment of the story and geography
but its combat has become very clunky and rough due to age
like, it has obvious problems both in design and coding
dark souls 3 has the best combat but the story is basically a worse rehash of 1
just tell them to go with dark souls 1
start off with the OG, see if they like it
if they find the combat too slow or frustrating for whatever reason, then tell them to go with 3 instead
i don't follow this logic
dark souls 3 bosses all having a second form doesn't deprive the second forms of adding another dimension to each fight
it sounds like you're asking for only some of the bosses to have second forms, which is just weird and pointless
sekiro is the best out of miyazaki's games, easily
also yes, what barkley said
when i said its combat is better i don't mean that the fights themselves are better, which is arguable for DS3 vanilla but definitely true for the DLC
what i meant is that the combat flows more effectively in general, with tighter mechanics, a more varied amount of tools at your disposal, greater depth to each weapon type, etc
gael is up there with the better sekiro bosses, top notch boss
i have to admit, i can't remember that soundtrack at all
it's not necessarily trash but it's certainly not good
definitely an oddity among most dark souls tracks
that having been said, there are four or five themes in dark souls 3 that fucking slap but most of them are forgettable
dark souls 1 music is generally a bit more distinctive and has better quality overall
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY
that got me good, hoo
i don't actually care for sulyvhan's track that much
it's good but didn't get me
gael, midir, abyss watchers, gundyr, and armour though
all quality tracks
this is not related to the ongoing conversation, but reminder that genndy tartakovsky's Primal is a cartoon that exists, and it is fucking incredible
how long did it take genndy to make season 1
holy shit <:POGGERS:408627094277455884>
i really hope that bloodborne gets brought to PC someday, i still haven't gotten to play it
that would be fucking cool
well, we don't know how eldenring will turn out yet
after my doubts and complete surprise at how fucking good sekiro was, i'm way more inclined to believe in him
but you never know
sekiro DLC is, i believe, confirmed not happening

started from 3.6 billion today, did three runs
i am getting that fucking fleet carrier for the beta on thursday SO HELP ME
homestuck had plenty of stupid in it, but that stupid was in service of actual jokes that were themselves not stupid
it's like the difference between making racist jokes and making jokes that make fun of racists
it's weirdly hard for people to distinguish between those things
homestuck also did have plenty of silly, but it was braced with a backbone of stuff that was treated with the proper amount of seriousness
you gotta have a good balance to get as good as it was
what's the difference
i don't think i really understood what you're trying to say there
oh, no, i see now
yeah, i guess that's what i was going for earlier
i want to see kanaya snap at jade in private later
her casual acceptance of this shit is frankly stunning
rose didn't just cheat on kanaya
she had an entire child with another member of their group and they both kept it a secret for 15 years
that's some next level shit
the fact that kanaya didn't know what the fuck yiffy is makes the update before this one feel really weird actually
where jade stormed into presumably their headquarters and screamed it at both of them
you'd think that would be something she would take rose aside and be like "we have a huge fucking problem"
they actually reference that in this update or a recent one, but i don't think it really did the thing justice
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
wow jade, maybe you should have used your own isolation as some kind of motivational reasoning to not keep your daughter's existence a secret from everyone else
_abusive_ parent time
what's the over/under on yiffy being a furry
i don't mean someone in a fursuit, but like a fucking dog human hybrid
that's fine andrew, but there are also plenty of people who make those jokes without it being some kind of psychological indication of their coming to terms with being gay
every teenager on the face of the planet makes dick jokes
so taking that as incontrovertible evidence of someone's impending gayness is kind of nonsensical
the thoughts of a koala: `leaf`
holy fucking shit dingus
those are like the noises dero and i make at each other when we're playing games together
or like the noises dero makes in general
yeah i like especially how that looks like an infinitely deep pit
it's time for my semi-annual listen of the enchilada complex
speaking of dero's voice
that's a pretty sick tradition
the enchilada complex is from a time when i was in undergraduate school where our basement flooded with water
dero's guitar got soaked and the neck of it warped to the point that it was hanging by a thin piece of wood
night barkley
the neck of the guitar was just so that dero could push it back and forth and cause the notes to shift in tone at will
so naturally she decided to record like seven songs with this
let me find my favorite
this is canonically the first one and i guess it's the best representative of the sound she was going for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N3xvbmROb8
but i have a particular soft spot in my heart for imnu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1hHR1aXhyA
financial stability is also the last one because she literally broke the guitar recording it, so the song is effectively 3 seconds long
those were good times, all the way back in like 2014
ah, god
i always get a tear in my eye when i listen to these again
enchilada complex is a trip, uncle funkle

as opposed to voting for what we've got now, again
which is not just insane, but also openly hostile to anyone who's currently already suffering because of it
like, don't get me wrong, i kind of hate biden
but at this point i'm being forced to resort to utilitarian logic
will biden be a horrible fuck up in office? yeah
will he be as bad as trump?
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck no
i would trust a dead person over trump at this point
at least dead people can't make a situation even worse

back to rereading wtc

YOU'RE FUCKING FIRED
thankfully for joon, he's growing past it
what on earth are you trying to suck me into
>impediment
the _creation_ of the flashes might be deemed an impediment to the comic, but the end result was usually something so memorable that it practically defined the comic
the best moments of homestuck were the parts that exceeded the bounds of a regular webcomic
and often enough that was a flash or a game
as such this just reads like a super bizarre take to me
the only thing about this that i really find valid is that creating flashes was a huge drain on hussie
i've always said that hussie's work ethic when working on homestuck 1 was completely ridiculous
but for fuck's sake, homestuck 2 is already taking exponentially more time to get anywhere
or like
i guess that the comic's narrative is progressing,  but it really, really doesn't feel that way
that's partially _because_ of the lack of flashes
as well as individually important developments, flashes often acted as bookends to major portions of the story
and so not having any of that in homestuck 2 is really fucking with my perception of the progression of things
<:broFrustration:533447620694114309>
this is the worst shit
that's kind of the thing too, is that i don't think any of us are realistically asking for several-minutes long flashes
unless they count 2-3 minutes as overly long
but a typical flash was like less than a minute long, if that
it's all so tiresome
that's how any skill development can and should work
if it's a matter of learning how to do something, then incorporate that into it by making stuff that suits their skill level
fucking ANYTHING instead of putting out excuses that make no sense
it has a few gifs
one of them i like actually
flashes doesn't literally refer to flashplayer, it's a colloquialism for "animations"
this is just obtuse bullshit
i didn't think i could be more disappointed in homestuck 2's development, but here we are
```It's good to show contempt for your audience.```
HOO boy
they really, really need to find someone who is competent at public relations
i don't want to be mean about it but this type of interactions have almost exclusively been embarrassing
part of storytelling is the presentation, and guess what's a more engaging format for delivering narrative developments especially in the specific context of homestuck? here's a hint: it isn't fucking prose
the odyssey was also written fucking 3000 years ago
this is absurd
<a:HyperNotLikeThis:520455961069223940>
every day we slide deeper into this nightmare reality
who could have thought that homestuck 2 would be made by people who appear to be aligned antithetically to how homestuck works
the thing is that the vriska/bec noir fight took place in an offshoot reality that didn't actually matter
and when we pull back from it, we literally never see it again
so not animating that is completely fine
or showing it even
the events of the last update take place in presumably a main timeline/reality of the story, and is almost explicitly in line with the kind of situation that would be ripe for even a short flash in the original comic
the prioritization and reasoning for this stuff is completely nonsensical
which one dva
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
jesus christ, stop making edits
that's gonna get us yelled at
the other leaders have been made aware of your crimes.
<:drewlinkaS:404057200622043137>
wait, WHAT?
what is this you're describing
my eyes are rapidly glazing over thinking about this update and the controversies around it
HEYT
you don't talk to my wife like that
buddy would you please sit down
i'm henry firth _AUDIENCE SCREAMING_
anyway, obviously this was one of those things that hussie mandated be in the comic
have any of them used that as like
a defense?
"well you guys like hussie's writing so much, why don't you like this" sort of deal?
<:mike:562688080486727694>
i'm officially changing this to an achewood server
homestuck is dead
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
a window into the mind of a deranged being
round what?
that's what happens when reality begins to break down around us
misha deserves death
misha stop being a cock
no one gives a shit
your opinion is invalid because something something inherit the server
lmao
misha still seething about san francisco
i never saw even one bit of human excrement on the sidewalks
although the smell of urine was pretty distinct in the tenderloin district
that part of san francisco was uniquely terrible, but i'm pretty sure every city has That Part of Town
i have to admit, there's basically nothing about southern california that appeals to me
i spent all my time there in northern california
the redwoods were extremely nice
if i could move to northern cali to live in the redwood forests, i would do it
those are some fucking amazing trees
i can see the appeal of living in a desert, if you enjoy heat and dryness
i like cold, wet weather
i tried to go to google in order to find a height converter, but i typed "h" by mistake and it brought me to homestuck
my immediate, visceral reaction was disgust
not a good sign
shame!
i didn't want to interrupt the conversation before, but i think i've already fucked it up
in which case
i want to say that i think some of my absolute favorite moments in RLM content are when rich evans fucking screams as he's impersonating something
this being a key example https://youtu.be/m2IV0BajqAk?t=2130
it fucking kills me every time
yeah, definitely
i wonder exactly how much experience they've had working with actual producers or directors who are like that
they've made a few comments over the years that indicate to me that they've got their fair share of experiences with that
i remember specifically in their ReView for Joe versus the Volcano
jim was appearing as a guest talker and he said something like "we've all worked for people like that, especially in this business"
deep rlm lore
what have mike and jay even done professionally, outside of their own projects
i read at some point that they have a couple decades experience working in film between the two of them
but was it practical effects stuff
that's kind of the impression i got from all of the technical explanations we've gotten from mike and jay
i'm sure rich has been in charge of handling set design and construction
given how much he's involved with plinkett's house
holy shit
that's definitely news to me
big mcthankies from mcspankies
in return, have a video of a couple of tank puppies making adorable noises

why couldn't hippos be the one that grew tusks
leave elephants and rhinos alone, go for hippos
they're literally an invasive species in the americas now
that bouncing seal video reminds me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96vnlEMbscs
five flipper rolls! `one two three four one` huh, HAH
moai and table tennis are by far the hardest ones, and i'm not sure that's strictly due to the beat
i think there's a lot of weirdness with the Ds game
DOO WOP DOO WOP DOOOOOOOOOOOOO WOP
froot
ddddddddd
yeah, precisely
that single notion of "if you don't like it don't read it" pisses me off the most about this recent discourse
it's such a vapid, unhelpful statement for basically everyone involved
it's just people being angry that other people don't like the things they like
and you know, in total fairness, there are a lot of people who are unnecessarily rude about it
but in general i see more people just genuinely trying to put forward their opinion about how they feel about this thing
wada, people trying to critically review things that they don't like is arguably more important than people reviewing things that they do like
it's someone trying to gain attention by manufacturing controversy, ignore the bisexuality thing
but wada, what do you mean about people "falling out" over this
uh
i think "staying informed" is a perfectly good reason to want to keep watching the news
i don't see your point
what the fuck are you talking about
the very reason that people keep reading homestuck and criticizing it is _because_ they care
that's literally the entire point
i mean, sure wadapan, you can have that take
i just think it's a bad take
and kind of hypocritical, actually?
aren't you the one who is ardently supportive of that transformers essay
what makes caring overly much about the cinematography of the transformers movies more valid than caring about homestuck
is it because that essay is positive in nature and the criticism that people offer homestuck 2 tends to be negative?
well TOUGH SHIT
i was going to say, please explain
wada, i guess my thing is that i don't feel like i'm "trapped" per se
although strictly speaking i kind of am, i can't just abandon this place if i up and decide i hate homestuck now
but more to the point, i don't think _most_ people feel that way
they may really dislike an update but "it makes me feel bad" is like a shorthand for more complicated feelings
although i would say that if someone is genuinely driven to depression by a mere story then they should probably stop reading it
that's getting into different territory than what's actually happening here though
that's usually the stuff that succeeds the most too
it's a bit difficult to really comment on because i haven't read MC in a while, but i believe i described the ending as a confusing, kind of uncomfortable thing because of the fact that the narrator is openly unreliable at that point
but i do think it's important to remember that literature being uncomfortable doesn't mean it's bad
however, most people can't handle that
so it's kind of unfortunately put aside most of the time
i'm not sure i properly understand what "lowbrow" means
oh, so the kinds of discussions that revolve around whether video games can be art or are just entertainment
i've always found that kind of thing pretentious
specifically, asserting that certain things cannot be art for arbitrary reasons
"anything can be art" is, at this point in this group, a cold take i think
the more controversial argument is about whether art can be good or not
as opposed to all art being "good" by someone's definition
yeah, but where do you start is the problem misha
how does one apply math to art
yeah, kind of
i'm not very educated in art
that's fine, but how
misha, i really hate the way you express yourself sometimes
that's fair
tarty, i don't question the fact that artists have used math in art for a very long time
i'm not talking about the creation of art, i'm talking about the interpretation and assessment of art
how do you apply math to discussing whether art in general is objectively good or not
oh
that is a WAY more reasonable argument than what i thought you were trying to say here
this is basically the thing i've been saying, which is that you can argue about art on an objective basis as long as you're discussing along certain axioms of quality
agreed
why must art be so hard
very exciting
i don't usually read ifnar's comments with an accent but for some reason, that one just
hit me like a sack of bricks
night zent
things are winding down
this is the last night of hsd ever
yeah no,  you're full of shit on this one mines
sorry to say
BIIIIIITCH ARE YOU FOR _REAL_
okay, i wouldn't say that
facebook, twitter, and discord are all social media platforms
but they have specific attributes to each that make them variously worse or better for certain things
wow woc, you shut the fuck up REAL fast
is it because i was actually saying something reasonable and measured instead of being a hack fraud shill
GET THE FUCK BACK IN YOUR HOLE
<:ree:475542526791516170>
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
woc, do you happen to know when frontier typically updates its servers in EST
is it at midnight or is it a different time
fuck
i'll google it
how can you kill a god?
shame on you
anyway, the reason i asked is because i've officially saved up enough credits to fully buy and upgrade a fleet carrier
i'm gonna grind out a couple more runs if i can, but even if i don't make enough that way i can get all the money i need by selling most of my ships
so you and dero and whoever else are gonna have to come checked it out
spread the word yo
i mean, i'm going to defend my thesis in less than two weeks
and unless i catastrophically fuck up, then i'll have earned my master's
so i'd say that's not bad
too bad the job market is irrevocably fucked up though
i'm surprised by how much i enjoy dagothwave
i never got past the first few hours of morrowind so it's a bit lost on me but god damn if it isn't fun
I'M A GOD
HOW CAN YOU KILL A GOOD
WHAT A GRAND AND INTOXICATING INNOCENCE
assassin's creed valhalla officially announced
trailer to come tomorrow
i like exploring old societies even if it's not accurate
i'm worried though, the gameplay loop for origins and odyssey sucks really hard
AC1 has--yeah, it had the advantage of its larger plot being a mystery
yeah, kind of
i mean that "it's the apple of eden" but it's not totally clear what that means
and then the end happens and it's like "whooooaaaa"
shut the fuck up br, you know nothing
you deserve death
it's not impressive writing, it was just fun
AC4 did a lot better because it's not really an assassin's creed game, it's the best pirate simulator in existence
i wish we were able to get more of that
ugh, christ
rogue is honestly fucking terrible
i don't even rememebr why i feel that way
but i've revisited most ac games at least once, and i have never had the desire to touch rogue again
how can you kill a god
how can you kill a god?
no soup for you

don't just stare, say good morning
within the last year, that's easily the meme woc has sent me the most
terrible
say good morning
yeah, i lost this time
<@!125433170047795200>
i'll fuckin do it again
icing on the cake for today: i actually generated a lot of notes for a SPAT entry
is my motivation to write finally coming back? even if just in trickles?
kind of exciting to consider
narrator: he was wrong
but in the meantime it's nice
doas
wat
the meaning of the anthropic principle is that you have to be careful when saying thoroughly established things "need" to work a certain way, because you're necessarily biased to think that given that things did indeed turn out that way
and to be sure, there are plenty of things that do indeed "need" to be a certain way
but there's also plenty of other stuff that turned out a particular way due to random action
tl;dr check yourself before you shrek yourself
i just did something that is honestly fine but felt mildly perverse for some reason
i like to put dry rub on my steaks and let them sit for a few nights
despite that, i haven't been able to get much flavor out of this spice set i got for christmas
so this time i added twice as much of like four different seasonings
but the steak i bought today is also pretty thin, so for good measure i rolled it into like a fucking tube
so i've got a little meat spiral sitting in my fridge, and i can't stop thinking about it
niklink this seasoning is really good, so i don't know why i'm not getting any flavor out of it when i cook
i leave those steaks in the fridge for like two days and then when i get done cooking them, nothing
some foods can be simple, some need to be complex
a steak that's cooked well can exhibit a wide range of flavors, but i like to experiment with different spices and see what compliments the umami
salt and pepper is needed of course, but you can also put other stuff in there as it suits your fancy
a little brown sugar, paprika, oregano, cumin
mix it all up
garlic powder
>cutting board
do you think i'm rich or something
just kidding, let me check this out
i literally said i'm kidding you illiterate fucks
anyway, this guy is like
actually a good cook
i'm merely pretending
this is good to keep in mind though
i can't tell how rare that steak is through this video
i have more to learn about cooking than i thought
<:sadCherub:293980812284657664>
yeah, me neither
there's no steakhouses around here, so i have to cook my own
i'm not very good at it yet
this video does seem pretty neat though
the steak i bought isn't like this though, and i have the hardest time getting the interior cooked evenly throughout
so i'll have to try it in the future
i'm going back to missouri in less than a month though, so chances are i'll just get some fuckin bbq and call it a day
god i miss burnt ends
back to writing spat
i wonder if i should publish this single entry when i'm done or wait until i have a few more done
this entry is rapidly ballooning out into more than i expected
maybe i should wait to publish it until i do a checkover and see how much of it is unnecessary
it feels weird to want to be writing this again after so many weeks
i love it
yes
ooga booga
that's completely perfect, fucking christ
this entry is becoming a monster
i might ask someone who is levelheaded to take a look at it and be like "yeah this is fine" or "you should cut a lot of this shit out"
yeah
you doing alright?
yeah, i feel you
hope you can get it sorted out
fuck it, i'll review the entry tomorrow after a good night's rest, and makin can look at it too
this one entry is fucking 7 pages long
and most of it is talking about the discourse from yesterday's update
MINES GO TO BED

oh god, quktime
what a fucking nightmare of a videoplayer
random question, have we watched Bee Movie yet
we should watch bee movie again
i'm not even sure how entertaining i expect bee movie to be, if at all
i just remember seeing that movie in theaters and then the one meme image where the guy the woman is dating turns around and gives her that look
i just explained above that i ahve, once in the theaters
also i never said eene was a bad stream show, i think
just that i don't have the inclination to stream it right now
makin needs to fuckin quit it with these very long term streams, we already have a lot on our plate so i'm not adding more on top
seen and watch are synonymous in this context
you fuck
we watched a few episodes and stopped
was sometime last year or before
i'm gonna reread it tomorrow to see if i feel differently about what it says, and then have makin check it over for good measure
what can i say, life comes at you fast
when release
i think a few days
uncle fill, you've got to get our air conditioner fixed _today_
i do not have stats for that
it's insanely tedious keeping track of message counts for individual users
i've wanted to automate that for a while but apparently it's an absolute bitch to do
if you people want a list of people i'm arbitrarily assigning the label of "regular" to, then i can provide that information tomorrow
i've listed every name that i've seen talking in here over the last week
i'll average the number of messages each person has sent in the last month or something like that
and then set a threshold for how many messages someone needs to have sent in a given timespan
also makin check the draft for SPAT, i wrote a large entry and i need you to tell me if it's fucking terrible
that's the spirit
yeah, making a new document for every set of entries would be dumb
sign
<:reeeeee:448158307677634561>
in the morning, assuming everything gets handled properly
i might end up massively rewriting it
there's a huge volume of bullshit that might or might not be worth keeping in
i get kind of hesitant describing larger problems or events in the homestuck fandom, as opposed to stuff solely relevant to this server
but like, at this point we could use a public record of more than just this place
if you don't know what SPAT is, check the bottom of the channel description
<:ree:475542526791516170>
oh, fair enough
maybe i should just keep all that shit in then
no, i wouldn't suggest adding revlar
there were fun conversations with him but he's steadily turned into an unmitigated prick, at least on the subreddit
that's an actual edit, weird
pretty sure i explicitly only gave commenting perms
oh well, don't destroy anything
i'm considering removing the bit about identity politics
your comment wondering where i was going with it made me realize that it's probably asking for trouble
"we don't take kindly to ~~FREAKS~~ people who question identity politics 'round these parts"
cyrene, you're a reasonable person who gives way more of a shit about this stuff than i do
would you mind if i sent you that particular excerpt to see what you think of it
it's probably not as bad as i fear, but it's always worth having other people look at shit
oda has been gone for a long while i thought
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
actually i think it won't be edited heavily, if at all
i'm waiting for cy to provide any suggestions, but she didn't really say anything about changing stuff
if she clears it then i'm putting it up tomorrow when i wake up
cy's given the approval
just for this one thing, because i trust her opinion
DARMOK AND JALAD AT TANAGRA
SHAKA, WHEN THE WALLS FELL
i give up, i lose at the sleeping game tonight
time to put up this SPAT entry
i'm staying up, it's time for an all nighter
my sleep schedule needs a reset anyway, it's even worse than usual lately because of this fucking quarantine
i have no idea how i would qualify myself as good or bad at that
what are you looking for in thinking-u-magic-itemsness
ah yes, that's what i was commenting on the other night when i was praising wales for his sheer dedication to tabletop RPGs
in that case i have no idea, i've never tried
his descriptions definitely gave me some room for thought though
really, it's important to keep in mind that the system/descriptions he provided are best suited for his own thing
which is, as i understand it, broadstrokes story while offering a significant degree of freedom in the short term
the first two seasons of TNG get really rough in places, the average writing quality gets better after that
but what the fuck are you talking about
encounter at farpoint is great
it's also like fundamentally integral to the overall arc of the show
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
i'm starting to think you don't actually know what i'm talking about
||the trial with Q as the judge serves as bookends to the entire series. in the final episode, Q reveals that the trial "never ended" and that picard was being tested over the entirety of the series||
YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
i always feel bad
but proceed
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
why do i exist at this moment
yeah probably
like, clinically, not "i actively feel bad right now"
it's been a slow realization over the last three years
i know, i was trying to make light of the situation
it was a good meme
fuck you let me finish this entry so i can publish it
what'll help is moving back near my family
and being done with this nightmare of a shit fuck career
https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/laterentries2020.html#A29 get at it ye wieners
potentially
what the fuck
alright, i'm fixing it
refresh, should be fixed
is this something i should specifically rephrase in the entry, or is it just general discussion about the idea
because i agree that the official team probably wasn't pursuing any kind of rep
thanks moon
it has been literally over a year now, i only read them the one time
also homestuck 2 has been severely demoralizing, so i think the part of my brain that stores homestuck information is slowly necrotizing
you keep changing your name
i've introduced you before i believe, but you used to be called polyphemus
and then something else before that
i can't remember, there's like 700 pages of this shit
tipsy i wrote about you pretty recently
you fuck
oh, damn, i haven't actually
weird, i thought i had mentioned tipsy more recently than that <:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
what, yes it does
don't look at the extra entries, you're in july of 2019 just before the main entries end
i'm not versed at all in nordic history, what time is this supposed to take place? who is that english king, if any in particular
there are so many things i'm ignorant of <:sadCherub:297824511477415938>

**DEADASS**
no multi, it's just a list of people i've observed talking in this channel over the last week
there is an appreciable degree of attention that women get when they play video games and people find out they're women
that's just a simple fact
the exact question is how pronounced this effect is
and it's going to differ wildly based on circumstances like what kind of game it is, and even what the people you're playing with are like
death penalties with due process are extremely costly, and death penalties without due process are extremely unethical
their own feces
over and over again
that's why the swamp is so poisonous
it's infinitely recycled biomatter
when is this fucking beta dropping
i'm getting tired of your shit frontier

"my lifeblood dries without entertainment"
for those who weren't around in the morning, spat update is out
check the changelog
and you take the sun
place feels slow enough, what's the issue
oh god there was a bonus update wasn't there
oh no
okay, slowmode it is
compared to our typical chat volume this is pretty slow, but i'm used to keeping up with like a blistering pace, so it's whatever
either way, have fun discussing the bonus update
i just read the backlog, was the bonus update really that bad
at this point i wouldn't donate my money to the homestuck patreon if my life depended on it
it's good to have contempt for your audience
so let me get this straight
this bonus update is basically insulting the audience straight up
and they're telling people to donate to the comic so they can be insulted?
sounds patently ridiculous
reminds me a little bit of people being told to inject bleach into their veins and then actually doing it, how strange
i can't effectively comment because i haven't actually read the bonus update
the snippets i'm seeing are pretty disappointing though
stop doing the linky function i want to talk about this update
sign, alright
mines i can't really tell what's going on from all of this
fuck it, let me read the whole thing
i need to be informed to describe the depth of my disappointment properly
no, i'm good
<@!260222802471157760> i can see where the confusion comes from but dirk is clearly an audience stand in here
although i have to admit, in a few places it's kind of ambiguous
a couple of times i almost thought he WAS meant to be an author, and in a way he kind of is
but there are parts of the dialogue that are completely unmistakeable as an audience reaction
what the fuck?
for clarity's sake i'm pulling an all-nighter so my brain isn't operating at full capacity
but what you said just sounds like "it's an audience stand in" with an extra step
please explain what you mean
to be honest i think i was primed to expect something that's way worse than it actually is
it's definitely insulting but there's like a thin veneer of subtlety they're going for
it doesn't really work, but they haven't yet descended to outright insults
i mean like
i think people who are outright angry about all of it need to take a chill pill, but i'm increasingly unsure how anyone can look at this content and find it entertaining
yeah, i guess that's the thing cy was talking about
if you don't take it seriously it's fine
but i care a little more than that
i mean, i guess it's ambitious in the sense that they're trying to write things that are pretty solidly out of their ability
a consistently meta narrative that probes deeper layers of that aspect of the story could be good and interesting
this execution is not good though
the words that come to mind are hamfisted and, as was said earlier, insecure
it doesn't matter if this bonus update was written in anticipation of negative reception or in response to it, the fact that it was penned at all is kind of embarrassing
bP, the notion of overthrowing hussie in any capacity was proven to be bullshit like months ago
if he was trying to inspire the audience to overthrow him as the authors/caretakers of the story, he wouldn't have entrusted it to an official team
the members of which then went on to explicitly state that that was a load of horseshit
she said it months ago bP
she explicitly brought up hussie's comments in that pgenpodcast episode where hussie dropped in to talk about putting things in the hands of the fans
and said "this was pretty clearly not what it sounded like"
i'm paraphrasing but you get the idea
she basically said that homestuck's direction was in the hands of the official team and distinctly _not_ the fandom at large
which is pretty much in contrast to the original message, but i'm not sure any of us are surprised by that anymore
bP, what do you think homestuck _is_
homestuck is a collection of properties that revolve around a common story
homestuck 1, homestuck 2, hiveswap, friendsim, pesterquest, paradox space, whatever the fuck
everything else outside of it basically doesn't matter because it's not actually homestuck
people can make derivative projects like vast error but no one gives a shit about them because that's not why we're reading _homestuck_
saying homestuck 2 and vast error are equally relevant is a very, very bad sign for homestuck 2
because vast error has nowhere near the level of influence of the original property, which is kind of what people here are interested in
we want to see a return to the quality and popularity of the original story
all of the things that the authors are doing, and especially how they interact with the fandom, is like antithetical to making something that will attract greater readership
if they don't care about that then more power to them, but it makes you wonder what their standard for "success" is
if they don't care about public reception in the slightest, then they probably wouldn't have a patreon and complain about how little money they make
if they don't care about attracting the widest audience possible, then they should probably just ignore people who don't like what they're making instead of lashing out at them for disliking it
you can't have it both ways
i guess what i'm getting at is that the motivations of the writers are unclear because they behave in contradictory ways, and even if it WAS clear, they're overly hostile towards people who criticize them
it inspires very little confidence about the overall quality and direction of the story
if they don't care what people think about it, then i don't know why they have a patreon or respond with the kind of vitriol we've seen so far
if they just want to make a story, then why the fuck are they publishing it in this manner
you do realize these are inherently conflicting ideals right
if you Just Want to Make a Story without exposing it to criticism, for whatever reason, then why would they bother making the story public
by the very act of publishing their story they're opening it up to being criticied
>they def okay with criticism
i'm sorry have you seen how some of the authors react to people who don't like their work
unintelligible screeching would probably be less aggravated than some of the stuff i've seen
i don't think it's an unreasonable expectation for a sequel work to share some similarities with its predecessor
obviously it shares a setting and characters
but the execution so far is so completely different that it's virtually unrecognizable
if they don't give a shit that's fine, but people are going to be agitated by that
i don't think i actually _do_ understand what kind of story they want to tell
because the product so far has been a garbled mess
i don't know, i feel like flashes were an extremely significant element of the original comic that gave it distinction and added a lot of quality
but strictly speaking, i guess they're not completely integral
so what, is the comic trying to like... insist that death of the author isn't possible? i don't get what that theme is supposed to mean
i mean, we have been occasionally
but the point still stands that homestuck 2 isn't good regardless of whether you're analyzing it as a sequel or a standalone work
i think it's valuable to examine a sequel work BOTH ways, as a sequel and as a standalone work
that's not really the problem here
the problem is that it's not good even just as a standalone thing, and it's especially bad when standing in homestuck's shadow
that's the unfortunate reality here
also that's a good point, analyzing it as a standalone work would probably go better if everything about the old narrative was completely tossed out
but as it is this is a direct continuation from where the epilogues left off
for a sequel work to be able to stand on its own, it needs to solidly establish a premise that either reexplains the details of the original work OR it needs to completely invent its own setting and characters
what does that even mean though
and how does it relate to homestuck 2
it's one thing to say that the epilogues are an off-ramp, but what is that sort of idea supposed to accomplish
is he saying that it's a stopping off point for the original narrative?
then why the fuck does it start off IMMEDIATELY after the end of the epilogues?
if we're treating the epilogues as their own work, then it's basically Homestuck -> Epilogues -> Homestuck 2
and that's completely fine, because there's a story thread that winds its way through each of those things
it contains corresponding characters and settings that are all related to each other
why would you not treat them as a collected set
you CAN analyze them as standalone works, but saying you're not supposed to analyze them as sequels is farcical
what???
are you openly admitting that it's complete nonsense?
holy fucking hell batman, this conversation is driving a spike into my temple
god damn it discord
god damn it discord
i'm stalin, and the purge is about to begin
nooo
what, the second installment?
hoooooooo my god
<@!184545248930693120> i tried following that video from yesterday
the steak one
i don't think it turned out well according to that, or at least not as good as it could have been
not the right kind of steak
but it undeniably tastes much better
i'll get to it when i GET TO IT
i've actually always wanted a heraldic coat of arms for my family
or we could make one for the HSD, really get some of those masturbatory pumps in
alright, so
after recording all of the names i've personally seen in this chatroom (omitting a few that i only saw once or didn't recognize)
there are 69 people (nice) who could arguably be considered regulars in this channel
oop, nevermind
grim wasn't in there, now it's 70
i distinctively remember grimPike so they count
but i don't know how active everyone has been, so i'm going to see how many messages each person sent across april
done
just kidding we're all in this together
nevermind, i repeated a name by accident so we're back down to 69
happy accidents
is discord still massively fucking up
i can't find two of the people i had on this list
maybe they left
well, they're removed from the pool, ree ree
dapnee, fluffiness
yeah, in that case it's discord fucking up
i can't find jamie either, although i know he's here
did dap name herself something else
literally not showing up in the search function
that's unfortunate
i'm doing the census
was trying to find you in the search bar, it finally worked
fucking CHRIST
it's impossible to finish it like this, more names are disappearing
i'll just do the ones i can find and finish it later
question, how many of misha's messages are
sent
like
this
i'm cutting his message count by 25%
oh my god, stop
whoa
i was worried that there were a lot of people i was missing in my census
but the sampling i took actually accounted for 92% of all activity in this channel
which i'm going to take as a sign that it's a pretty good representation of the regulars here
the total number of messages sent in lit for the month of april is about 120,000, and the number of messages i got through the census is about 110,000
that's not including the people that discord can't let me search for right now, so that number might improve a bit
too many, bP
average number of messages sent per user is 1,688
again, not accounting for the people i couldn't search for
how so
that depends on how you're defining a regular
i'm trying to figure that part out, this was literally just me recording every name i saw
channel reg
oh, wait
hold on
i forgot to adjust misha's number to account for his ridiculous spam
alright, that didn't actually change the average that much
before i make a deliberation, i want to do a little research about like
determining relative abundance of activity within a group
if such a thing even exists
also yes mines, it's only for april
doing it for the entire history of the channel would be madness
jamie for the month of april it's 1,200
that's below average, but i'm not trying to make a judgment call based on messages sent alone, there's wiggle room because of quality of discussion and how spread out someone's activity is over the month
mint 's only been talking here for like a week? i think?
but she's already got almost a thosuand messages
as opposed to someone who talks less but participates more generally
anyway, let me do some research real fast and see if i can turn anything up
because i don't trust robots sein
üî™
anyway, my first thought is to make a threshold for being considered a regular that's the average number of messages divided by x
i don't know what x is at this point
it could be ten, it could be 5, it could be 2
it might not even be viable to divide the average up and use that as a threshold
i'll look it up
unsure if this will help, but it's interesting nonetheless https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-011-0070-3
```Another common method involves simply counting turns (or length of turns) for each member and then calculating participation from these easily coded counts. This turn count measure is especially practical when transcripts of speech exist or when the team communications are electronic. Even in live-coding or coding-from-video cases, it is relatively straightforward. Second Messenger is a recent technological advance in which each participant wears a noise-canceling microphone that automatically captures aggregate time-stamped segments of individual speech (DiMicco & Bender, 2007).```
https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/laterentries2020.html#A29
i've already shared SPAT with someone who was studying different social media platforms and their relevance to fandom
apparently SPAT was deemed useful because discord in particular is kind of restrictive to search for stuff on
which sounds wrong because it literally has a search function
but researchers usually have bots that scrape social media websites
in order to scrape a discord server you have to be in it
so discord is kind of a hole for internet researchers right now
well, it wouldn't be a very good record if i whitewashed all the shit that we do wrong
i'm not here to make us look like good guys and everyone else sucks
homestuck's fandom history is extremely complicated and is worth recording in general
but i have the most access to this place in particular, and i care most about the people in this channel
so it be

i'm getting way in over my head here
mines, if i'm reading this right, then Ps refers to a relative abundance bound to a value between 0 and 1
so like 0.251
and you can just multiply that number by 100 to get a percentage
so if someone has an activity of relative abundance at 0.02, then they're responsible for 2% of the overall activity
actually you know what, i realized that this doesn't actually help me at all
i'm not trying to figure out someone's exact level of contribution, i'm trying to figure out how to define a regular <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
this is completely useless
it's not going to be a very accurate or precise metric, but i'm still leaning towards average number of messages divided by x
the higher x is, the lower the threshold to be considered a regular
i guess it would be useful to have a range going off of that calculation
so it's not JUST average divided by x, but comparison of average divided by multiple values
well, yes
but by that metric, everyone i listed is a regular
to be fair, i'm completely fine with that
but i'm a SCIENTIST damn it
i need to overcomplicate this unnecessarily
no, i've just been curious about this concept for a while
"how to define a regular"
specifically through a quantitative lens
yeah, it was kind of a shitshow earlier
but a fun shitshow for the most part
<:ree:475542526791516170> no secrets among friends
if you don't participate enough, i whip you violently
bbbbbbuuuuuhhhhhh
i've made an official decision on how to determine who is a regular
_breathes in_
who cares
that happens a lot in here veli
why would i be here if not to waste my time
marquis you like never speak in here
you speak a lot in gen though don't you
so you'd be a gen reg, not a lit reg
get FUCKED
anyway, without strictly quantifying it, i guess it's just a mixture of activity and recognizability
i marked down every name i saw and i recognized basically all of them
but some of these people are definitely less active than others
mind you it's missing a few people through discord fuckery or me not being able to keep an eye on the place 100% of the time
here though

nothing now, i'm dead
yeah
i'll even put it into a graph
yeah, you definitely haven't talked very much before now cruuk
if you check your total messages sent here for the month of april i imagine it's at best a couple hundred
not a slight against you, just saying
you gotta PLAY IF YOU WANNA WIN

no
that's after i reduced his message count by 25%
the actual number of messages he's sent in here is over 11,000 for the month of april
ree ree, etc

have fun
like i said, i'm missing a few names and discord wouldn't let me find others
neth should be on there, tripheus
a couple others that i can't think of
we have almost 75 people who i can readily recognize in here
probably more actually
i love <a:anumbersNUMBERS:394370289036820480>
it's weird to look at this data, honestly
i'm mentally comparing it to sydlexia
this server is like
hold on, let me see
this place is literally 550 times bigger than sydlexia's IRC channel
i'm not sure how that works out as a proportion of activity
like, per user, how many messages are sent on average
i don't know if it'd be a similar rate of activity between both places

this place is like 90% of your overall activity in this server
184000 messages total,  61000 in altgen,  57000 here
yeah, altgen got really fucking slow for a while
don't remember exactly when, but it was at or below 1,000 messages a day at its worst
gen almost literally died when hangout was still a thing
below a hundred messages a day at times
that was a frightening time
welcome moon and star
i think i would have remembered if you did
that's fucking nuts
now i'm watching "Just Do It" again

i think i'm finally starting to make sense of investment strategies and how to effectively choose certain options
yes, but you can make money even when it's going down
i put 100 dollars in a few months ago and have been bleeding a bit here and there, sometimes through bad decisions and sometimes through lack of awareness about how the market works
but i'm pleased to say that i just got myself up over 250 bucks
STONKS
jell o
unclear answer, i'll try again later
what's up nikki
misha is mean to everyone, it's how you know he's your friend
you know he's your enemy if he's SUPER mean to you
to give you a boner
talk more, or else üî™
M I S G U I D E D
nikki if you want more quotes you should hang out in cafe lit
we're always making quotes because we never shut the fuck up
also this is going to sound like a lie but no ci
there was a brief period of time when the linky function came out where i was a bit more self-aware about what i posted
but i didn't really say anything super wacky to make use of that, and over time whenever i say ridiculous shit it's always _afterwards_ that i go "oh shit right, we have a bot"
a bit of both
it's very fun when it comes around but i don't have that notion in the back of my mind at all times, that what i say is being catalogued to spit out later
if anything linkybot is more aware than i am
<:howshocking:589678117811912733>
yeah, it would get spammy if people could use it anywhere
oh shit <:howlow2:676840417328889962>
i didn't realize that was a function
perfect timing
if i'm not mistaken, fluffy ends up missing a shit ton of the streams for some reason
i don't remember exactly
i wonder if those will ever, ever die out
i'm sure there'll be at least one who is always around, at least until all homestuck fans finally die
i wouldn't be playing on it but i can create a terraria server, sure
not right now, too much other stuff i'm interested in
dude i said i would make the server, you guys can very easily play on it while i AFK
i will be your server god, unmoving
setting up the server now
what parameters do we want
oh, is it not released yet
you people suck
get out of my cloud
oh, if it's on the 16th then i might actually play
that's after i finish my defense
what the fuck are you guys talking about
i heard something about a lawsuit against him
i'm pretty sure tesla has been doing some funky shit with its assets and stock earnings, but i know no details
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
thanks for nothing linky bot
yeah, i've been earning my graduate degree
why
which part
that's closer than woc
i'm at virginia tech, about to leave at the end of the month though
that's new jersey you wiener
well moth man certainly ain't here
anyway, it's a shame rina
if we had known about this earlier, we could have gotten pizza
but coronavirus has stolen these opportunities from us
curse you, covid-19
well in that case the confusion is understandable
he's really smart but he's also an asshole
lots of stories about abusing his wife and previous partners
strict requirements of his workers that are heavily overworked
and then this stuff, which is basically a cry for attention and/or him being a vain asshole
there might be some logic in what he's doing but i can't see it, and it stinks regardless
i'm sure it is, but i also wouldn't be surprised if that's what he's doing
i heard earlier that he's undergoing a new lawsuit, but i can't actually find any info on that
thanks for the reminder
GINJA
you first bitch
you know, the more i think about it, the more confused LOST's ending is
it's kind of nice but not in a very substantial way
there's a pretty huge gap in meaning/importance of ||real life stuff versus the afterlife||
the latter provides a good sense of conclusion, but at the same time it's not actually that closely linked to the former
feels like the writers knew what they were doing ||in real life|| would piss people off, so they gave the characters a proper "ending"
which i mean, kudos to them for actually being self-aware and trying to mitigate a problem
but they could have just taken more time to write better stuff
it's kind of an ass pull, didn't really deliver on the promises of mystery early in the show
but all things considered it wasn't the worst stuff they could have done
oh god, i totally forgot about the weird temple shit
also, ||there was a lot of ambiguity with the smoke monster and its motivations||
||it was stated multiple times that if it got off the island the world will end, but the smoke monster literally never stated that as its goal||
||it would be different if there was some difference in the motivations between the smoke monster and the human it came out of back in ancient times||
||but there is literally no difference in their motivations||
||maybe instead of just using the dude's body it was literally a supernatural form for that guy||
||in which case, why would he want to do anything except get off the fucking island||
it's not clearly explained
what's racist about it
the lips?
i think you guys are reading way into this and anthropomorphizing something that shouldn't be
bah
i can see it but i don't want to
does that make me problematic
the movie?
the movie came out in 2008 and was pretty successful
rdj has blackface in it because he's playing an actor who thinks he can do any role
this discussion has been hashed out pretty extensively in the past, people rediscovering it have no real ground to stand on
yes, that's literally the point qweq
it's poking fun at actors who think this is fine
oh, i didn't realize you were talking about the people who didn't understand it
thought you were saying the movie was actually racist
wow mag, that brought me screaming back to a conversation i had here a couple years ago
where i asked if there would be other terms like "cuck," and everyone immediately answered yes
no llf, not definition-wise
just in terms of "it catches on for a bit"
like a fad
simp is probably going to be around for a while, as near as i can tell it's still a fresh term
the word simp with this definition has technically been around since like 2013, it just didn't see major usage
that's kind of what we're discussing here
is the curve of usage
where i think we're still on an upward trend
it's hard to tell where the peak is for common slang
trickster asked to be banned to focus on personal stuff
the modern spread began in late october last year
as much hate as it gets, you guys really should use know your meme more https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/simp
then dig up some proof
if you say something in here you need to be prepared to back it up or be ridiculed
most of us elect for the latter case
will you?
thanks doc
look, we need our daily dose
it's weird to think about, isn't it
people have been getting their daily doses now for over a decade
thanks doc
i actually fucking love that
because you can tell every distinct piece of the original image
this is a wonderful day
yeah, rocks on the left and right, piccolo green and purple, vegeta blue
DON'T GET THE ORIGINAL
i'll describe it and anyone who's curious can ask for a DM
it's piccolo fucking vegeta in the ass
VIOLENTLY
if you're not familiar with the phrase "thanks doc" it's because the gif was so widespread originally and got posted so often on 4chan that people would call it their daily dose whenever they saw it
i think it was a bait and switch sort of deal like rick rolls
but then of course, "thanks doc" comes from daily dose, so there you go
that's pretty good, thanks llf
thanks doc
yes
complete daily dose spam
thanks doc
fesh pince of
we need more watershed memes

well, i guess that's a decent chunk of their market cap
it's about 10.2% of their value, so sure
its value will go right back up, don't worry
i wonder what spurred him to do this
maybe drugs
regardless, musk's handlers need to get him quick

oof
<@!125433170047795200> i've decided to splurge a bit since i've basically saved up enough money for a fully funded fleet carrier and then some, i think between now and actual release i'll save up to 10 billion credits total
but regardless, my shipyard is looking really good
i've got my corvette for laser mining overlapping triple minerals
i've got a python for core mining
i've got an FDL for medium sized fights, and i'm currently outfitting a second corvette for heavy duty fighting
i'm engineering this thing to be a complete fucking monster
5 beam lasers and two size 4 multicannons, one modified to have corrosive rounds and the other incendiary
i think i'll try my hand at piracy with it too
i have become an ED god
not quite as much as i was at first
now i only slightly suck
could be good
let me finish outfitting this thing, might be another hour or so
most of that is vehicle transfer time
i'll meet you at shinrarta or wherever
that's probably best

what on fucking earth
that's exciting, potentially
yeah but unknowable in perceptible literature usually just turns into the weirdest/most foreign thing we can find on earth
which is stuff with tentacles and worms
worms seriously don't feel like they belong on this earth
some of them anyway
bobbit worms? utter nightmare
yes.
hell yes.
hell. fucking. yes.
the last week feels like it was a year long
i got as far as digging into the caves below my fortress, but then it was kind of overwhelming figuring out what to do next
i need to set up a further goal at some point to specifically reach
because i like not having a defined win condition, but dwarf fortress almost feels too open ended
that actually sounds pretty fun
too bad i'll have to relearn everything if i decide to do it
or rats
i'm late perhaps but the consensus is that the beginning of wtc _is_ no better than a typical isekai
but the quality begins to shine through later
misha, isekai is seen as vaguely derogatory here
i'm not exactly a literature buff so i don't know exactly
it's not about being revolutionary, it's a bout most isekai being kind of poor in quality because of their very nature as abusable self-inserts
misha, i wasn't saying that's how _i_ feel
that's just the consensus i've seen over the years here
i think one of the only other isekai i've read besides dream drive and wtc is uh
the one manga, mar something?
marchen awakens romance?
misha you fucking dumbass
i literally just explained to you that it's NOT my own opinion
pull your head out of your sphincter
you will suffer
anyway, marchen awakens romance was fun when i read it, but i was in middle school
wow, that was quick mag
i mean, sure, with all the things that accompanies that
jackson is
well, from what i remember, he doesn't really ever change in personality, except maybe becomes more eager to help people
but i don't remember if that's because he wanted to help them for their own sake or for the development of his own power
hot take, the porn is the best part of dream drive, and you're all just prudes
yeah, that was the joke
yes, but i think it finished after
i remember a tiny piece of ward but i stopped reading it
promised myself i'd wait until it was done, because as a serial experience it was just rough
so i guess i gotta read ward now
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
<@!207991389613457408> apparently thhe game director of black flag and origins is working as the creative director for valhalla
i feel a lot more hopeful for the game now
it took longer to watch than it took them to make theGREAT WALL OF _CHINA_
i think it's more about having the option of doing stuff
i feel like that distinction isn't made enough when it comes to game design
what do you mean
what is panic run
no
death
no, it's about reincarnation

i need to stop saying things that aren't imminently memeable
dammit, it doesn't include edits

IT'S PERFECT
pog
i wouldn't say that, so i doubt it
linky is intrinsically tied to me, i can speak for it
they're split up, yeah
yes you are
i command it
i wonder what the size of jman's archive was
that actually sounds kind of funny
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
but yeah, i did feel like your estimate of how much storage a single discord message takes up was rather inflated
you techie folks hash it out, i need to get ready for bed
i want a linky makin conversation markov chain ON MY DESK
COALLATED, TRIPLICATE
IN THE MORNING
you guys have no idea some of the conversations we've had
makin has revealed some super heavy shit to me
like how he has a shrine to danny devito
oops did i say that out loud
maybe you guys should induct sein into your ~~hall of justice~~ programming circle
i wonder what it's like to have a reasonable content creator who can admit their flaws and mistakes
<@!158932537085919232> there's a lot of demand for different people to be on the bot, he's working through some of the logistics of storing messages because he and nat were using some system that caused a lot of bulky data or something
i'm not really a bot guy, i don't know
<@!191265659936702464> <@!120187484863856640> prawn/shrimp are crustaceans, which  are a really large group of arthropods, but they're collected just under the phylum group so they're quite diverse and also as morphologically distinct from conventional "bugs" as you can get
i care, taxonomy is fascinating stuff
but yeah, to use a family tree comparison
they're still within striking distance of each other
like, they're distinctly related
but it's like a second or third cousin kind of deal
you would see them at a family gathering but you wouldn't talk to them ever probably
i can explain in further detail if you like
but that's the gist of it
doggo pictures are nice as long as they aren't overdone
also i have to say
i conducted an experiment this morning
where i woke up at 9:30 but then accidentally fell back asleep until 30 minutes ago
and then i took an energy drink as soon as i was cognizant enough to do so
but i didn't get up out of bed
i was able to maintain a drowsy state while still experiencing the physical effects of caffeine
it was actually quite fascinating, the mental effects didn't kick in until i had decided to get up out of bed
andn ow it feels like i've been awake for several hours
yes, my heart rate went up and i could feel my blood vessels constricting, increasing blood pressure
especially around my cranium and extremities
it felt like a series of prickling sensations across my entire body
coffee is fucking terrible, i drink those cringey gamer energy drinks
jamie, i don't claim to be rational
i'm not conceited like that
i miss taxonomy talk, can we go back to that
i was actually thinking about this last night, with how diverse the animal kingdom is
it's easy to think about animals in terms of the obvious stuff like chordates, ie reptiles, fish, mammals, avians, and amphibians
i've had people legitimately ask whether bugs are animals or not
and i guess it's not totally obvious what counts as an animal
like the further you deviate morphologically from chordates, the less obvious it is
oh
dog posting is fine but should be subject to the same level of "don't spam this" as literally any other topic
this channel is about going with the flow, so if dog posting naturally occurs, let it be until it genuinely starts to be a mess or until it's forcibly hogging other discussion
derailing discussions <:jackBluh:585537437489561601>
i've always hated that
if it's a couple of people trying to hijack a conversation because they're not interested, i will _kill_
which is to say, don't let that happen
it's been a quantifiable problem in the past
hasn't really reared its head recently
üî™
we all love dogs here
or else
this place and gen do not have the same cultural expectations
yes and no
we don't _derail_ conversation wada
we redirect it
that's a fine difference but an important one
and we only redirect conversation if it overly hogs the channel for an extended period of time
this has happened in the past but not overly much
yes, it's loosely defined
anyway, most conventional alien-but-not-humanoid designs are based off of annelids, gastropods, and arthropods
maybe cnidarians in some cases
thanks for coming to my ted talk
you guys realize we have a fathusky channel right
why do you need to post dogs here specifically
why you heff to ~~be mad~~ post doggo
<@!87363246360649728> a conversation i have with my dad sometimes is about the nature of life on earth and how fundamentally different you could get it based on degree of reasonableness
like, all life on earth is fundamentally based on carbon as a backbone element
we literally have an entire subfield of chemistry called organic chemistry because carbon singlehandedly allows the formation of an enormous quantity of unique molecules
due to its connectivity owing to valence electrons
so logically
you should be able to get a similar level of connectivity from a related element, and the next step up is silicon
silicon however is harder to work with owing to its electron shell structure, it can form as many connections as carbon but it's harder to do so
so we both think that silicon lifeforms would be maybe possible in a very hot environment
like, a very poor example would be carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct of respiration
silicon dioxide is sand
but if they had an analogous bodily system to ours, maybe a silicon based lifeform could respirate liquid sand somehow
it's more likely that they wouldn't resemble our bodies at all of course
and then you get into the possibility of stuff that isn't even remotely similar to us at all, like something that doesn't incorporate carbon into its general bodily structure
an example i've seen in science fiction is gaseous lifeforms that float around on the surface of gas giants
it's not that it was debunked, it's that it was wildly misrepresented by journalists
they discovered a species of bacteria in a lake that was able to replace one of its nucleotides with an arsenic-based one, which was thought to be impossible
they said it was "arsenic based" which is far more crazy
but just having one of your nucleotides replaced is within the realm of understandability once you know what's going on
anyway, an example of a potential lifeform that's really separated from us would be uh
this theoretical construct i read about in undergraduate school
most eukaryotic cells, and especially those in mammals like us, have an outer shell called a phospholipid bilayer
which of course is carbon based and incorporates fatty acids to create a permeable membrane
but some team in a university somewhere managed to theorize and replicate a cell membrane that was composed entirely of methane
which is fucking nuts
it had to be at extremely low temperatures because methane is gaseous at room temperature
but the methane had just the right kind of molecular connectivity that it was able to form a hollow sphere
so imagine a place like the moon titan
which has an enormous quantity of methane that's a liquid because of the temperature
over billions of years, perhaps it's possible that distinct form of life has risen there
we don't know obviously, but aside from europa it's one of the more likely candidates
what do you mean
it's been a while so i don't remember 100%
my brain is telling me that they theorized it could exist and then created one using chemical manipulation
you can manually place molecules at a small enough level if you have the right tools
but they may have only theorized the structure can exist
like i said, it was undergraduate school
think i read about that 5 years ago or so
ah, this might be the paper i read https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400067
they called the structures "azotasomes"
i imagine due to the ambient energy of a low temperature environment, any complex life we find there would be WAY slower than on earth
if it even took a form we could register
the problem with finding non-carbon based life is that we have no idea what it could possibly look like
so we're at a distinct disadvantage with detecting it
we could be living among it right now and would never know until we happened to look for it the right way
do you people have any self control
we need to have a purge
yes i have
misha, i have to be honest
my life the last few years has been pretty turbulent from a personal perspective
and there are a lot of things i've wanted to experience but haven't had the chance to
once i get out of this shit fuck place maybe i'll have more motivation to actually do new things again
pathologic 2 is near the top of my life once i feel capable of handling it
like janitor
also u r mr gay
god, what do i even want to do today
you people are exhausting
i'd rather die, except chevy chase casually harassing people is enjoyable
what, like
in the show
nah, that's gotta be a fakeout
oh right
i forgot that chevy chase is a horrible human being no one likes to work with
drew is gay, you pinged as a joke
i'm sorry you're a casualty of these conversations
||He also leaves each member of the study group a cylinder of his frozen sperm should they like to continue his legacy, the filling of which is revealed to have caused his death. ||
what the fuck is this show
because i'm probably never going to watch this show properly
i feel bad for yelling about dogposting earlier, floppy boy '86 is an instant classic that we need to enshrine forever
i'm not biased against it, you misunderstand my intentions or motives
i'm lazy, that's all there is to it
i also have issues starting new things
i tend to go back and play/watch old stuff instead of experiencing new media, it's kind of a problem
when i bothered to watch a couple of times i did like the dynamic of the group and the writing is pretty snappy
obviously there is good appeal to it
i'm just bad at starting new stuff
yes, that's what i mean
things i have already experienced
i don't know why i'm like that
what a grand and intoxicating experience?
i've never beaten morrowind but i really want to do that
are there any mods that make it less frustrating for people who are already used to the coddling that oblivion and skyrim more accessible to people
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
just last night i watched a movie where danny devito mpregged arnold schwarzeneggar
junior, 1994
i'm not sure what coke fueled dream led to the development of this movie
did the other one also involve artificial insemination
a very refined cat
what year was this
oh, 1988
wow
i wonder how awful this movie is
actually
in junior, he explains that he's from austria
blew my mind when i heard it
yes
the world is a strange place
i'm not gonna lie, i was really hateful of junior for most of the movie
but when i put aside my anger, it was fascinating for just how 90s it was
it came out in that time where i think hollywood execs were willing to try anything and see what stuck
i can't imagine any other circumstances that would allow that movie to exist
it is not too late for my mercy
d|| üêî ||
i'll be there in a few minutes, begin without me
who knows
i would love it more if it didn't probably jeopardize our chances of space exploration and colonization
otherwise it is very funny
in a depressing kind of way
as opposed to what, random scribbling
i've been to a city that has old-style layout due to history
it was a fucking nightmare to try and navigate in a car
<:mike:562688080486727694>
CANCELLED
it's the only way i can calm my unfathomable rage
`it is not too late for my mercy`
maybe
it'd be best to find an expression that we don't have covered yet
but then again, most of the emotes i'm thinking of are on different servers
let me tell you boys something about women
nevev vev vev, neVEV vev VEV
shame on you sweet nerevar
:twotrucks:
aw
the ass was phat
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
it's pretty long, over a million words
finishing soon though
thanks woc
i appreciate you
yeah, but crafting those doors is probably hard
also andrew i have bad news
i caved
i'm now ultimate high elf
rune keeper extraordinaire
i am your gandalf
honestly i kind of like the idea
now i can travel freely through middle earth as i please
this is what i wanted from the beginning
yeah top
i think that if i have to grind to visit moria that's... okay?
it's not ideal but at least i don't have to suffer through hundreds of hours to get to where i am now
yeah i'm probably gonna be pissing around for at least half an hour
if you want to get online again and accompany me as i descend upon these poor creatures
oh, this is a new incident?
i was reminded of something similar that happened years ago
holy shit
well, it's good they caught her
people like that are scum

you will perish
<a:AREYOUYOUSERIOUS:569040953898434571>
WORK IS THEFT OF OUR TIME AND ENERGY
RISE UP
that reminds me, the mask i made turned out like shit
wish i had more craftiness for that kind of thing
and also decent looking material
i was, yeah
sort of anyway
i actually wasn't sewing it properly
in the sense that, there was a guide for a quick face mask that the surgeon general put out
i used that but then made it easier to keep it in that shape with some needle and thread
if i had actually bothered to look up a design maybe it wouldn't have turned out like shit
but alas, i have no fabric to work with
it's weird to think of bandanas being seen as socially appropriate clothing now
where i grew up you would be immediately heckled as a hoodlum for it
thanks mint
i'll probably tackle this sometime tomorrow, maybe
i have a normal facemask right now that works just fine, but i don't have any replacements so it's starting to get a bit gross
i never thought of myself as having halitosis, but i guess anything stinks if you breathe into it enough
cy <:jaedAngery:347205246059282443>
you shilled this last night too
careful, icarus
i was going to say
it gives you an excuse to become primal
unrestrained
i mean
not all sharp things are pointy, but all pointy things are sharp
we can also use sharp to describe things that are very pointy
like a needle would be called sharp
that's fair
i would eat a chicken with my hands
if i was hungry enough
or angry
no, i mean a whole roasted chicken
which i now want
were you fucking drunk
that actually sounds fun woc
sometimes i dream of times when humans were less refined, and they ate, slept, shit, fucked, hid, fought in nakedness and raw being
roasting meat on a fire until it burns, ripping into it with cracked fingernails and split teeth
juice dribbling down your chin, into your hair, nothing but the sound of popping embers and nocturnal wildlife around you
and then you get cholera and die
what a life
who made this work of art
clearly this guy is just thicc
it depends on the strength of the magnet
your conventional household magnet that you stick on fridges? you will probably never be harmed by those
all the way up to neodymium magnets
industrial strength electromagnets might cause some kind of harm
yeah you're probably fine
is it just magnetism or is it some other EM wave
yeah but the concentration of iron in your blood is so low that realistically you won't be affected at all
it's only with super fuck huge strength magnets you need to worry about that, and those are typically marked off so people can't get close
actually now that i think about it, i don't know of any magnet strong enough that would suck the iron out of your blood
let's see if that exists, shall we
lmao
yeah, that's not ever gonna hurt you
hematite is fine
lmao
some dude levitated frogs using strong enough magnets https://youtu.be/6gbUZsI-oxc
apparently there were no ill side effects on the frogs
not as far as i'm aware
also the thing is that when iron becomes part of a molecule, it tends to lose its ferromagnetic properties
which means it's not affected by magnetics as strongly, if at all
even if it were, the magnet would have to be strong enough to forcibly break the chemical bonds between atoms, which is generally not the case
it has to do with the structural composition of cellular receptors
so like, on the outside of various cells in the body, there are these little things that take incoming chemicals and can respond to them in different ways
this works because the receptors are shaped in a certain way that it can only be activated by the presence of specific chemicals
so like
to use simplistic shapes as an analogy, the square goes in the square hole
scaling up, sugar goes in the sugar receptor
ree ree, etc
i'll paris _your_ SAD
!
we need more parises (parii?) that make people trip balls forever
i would go to one of those
<@!111477124384202752> are you dead
shame
gonna have to style on him tomorrow or at the end of the week, whichever
i LITERALLY
just got in bed
nah, just wanted to see what you thought
we can do that tomorrow
now that i don't actually have to worry about the greater majority of threats in this game, i actually feel pretty excited to just roam around?
i didn't even say anything
i don't know, strength
whatever we'll do it tomorrow
ya all
y'all
it's common enough parlance

i just want words of power
```I SHOULD KICK YOUR FUCKING ASS```
no, carlarc took me off guard for a second but i think he might unironically have a point
i don't know if jurassic park really works on the same kind of level as a scifi story
its concept is rooted in scifi but the development of the plot is less so
it has to do with the way that scifi treats its story
you can have stories that involve a lot of hightech shit that aren't actually scifi
star wars being a principal example
it involves extensive use of futuristic technology but the themes and progression aren't about science
i'm trying to remember jurassic park the movie and then the book, and remember how they're different
no, not really
it's a complicated issue, i'm just providing a really brief explanation of my thought process here
not really
maybe in the book
but in the movie it's mostly philosophical garbage
"GOD MAKES MAN" rant etc
the book is a different beast, sure
i don't remember it, i read it in high school
so i'll dip out
actually i do remember the chaos theory being a core theme, with the idea of dinosaurs being this uncontainable force that will inevitably break out of their holdings through one error or another
it went so far as to have a picture of a tessellating  image expand in front of every chapter
like i said, i haven't read the book since high school so i'm wieners
eh
yeah, i guess so
it's not a husk, more like a husk
let the hate flow through you
i mean, i don't know
i can't pretend to know what hussie's motives are
but i do think that the razor applies here: malice versus incompetence, etc
i don't think hussie or his subordinates would actually like... try purposefully to fuck themselves over with a well loved webcomic like this
i have to assume they're hopelessly out of touch or something
most of the people on the team have said shit to the effect of "i'm poor lol," and homestuck is such a potential moneycow that i have no idea why they would actively work towards its destruction
i think they're just caught between wanting to hold to their personal principles and ideology, versus doing stuff that would make their work more conventionally successful and help them make money
yes absolutely zent
but it needs to be capitalized on properly, and so far they've done basically everything wrong in that regard
they're making a little money but they have to split up with a team of like
what, 8 people minimum?
part of the reason updates are so slow is because they still have primary jobs to take care of, homestuck is a thing on the side
they need to fucking fire like 90% of their team, have one writer and a couple artists
make them work on it full time
less people to split the money, more consistent quality
i'm not sure if i'm using "out of touch" correctly, i'm just saying that the creators are out of sync with their audience
or at least, they're out of sync with a lot of people here and on the subreddit
maybe this shit appeals to their twitter fans
funniest shit i've ever seen
you shouldn't be cutting into your table
that looks like fucking gellatin
alright, i've had enough
fried dandelions <:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
do you think these people are secretly trying to fuck peoples' stuff up
like some kind of awful prank
"haha we'll tell them to microwave this shit for 10 minutes"
oh, so it's the same principle as clickbait
we need a reckoning
get with the times old man, the way of the future is quick paced interactions and topics that don't last for more than 30 seconds
as evidenced by the fact that chat is now dead
but justin roiland has like four thousand different voices he can do

/r/FellowKids just shoveling the karma into their mouths today
nice
also misha, where have you been for lotro
we actually made it to caradhras last night
i also bit the bullet and went to level 120 because i'm tired of being guided and getting killed, so now i will pop bitches to defend y'all instead
lmao
sorry you were tired
yeah, i feel you
wow, that's pretty early
my sleep schedule is kind of similar but it's kind of aggravated in the worse aspects than before
i usually was able to convince myself to go to bed at 1 or 2 on good days, but now it's either 4 AM or all nighter
taking up caffeine to help me get through thesis work hasn't helped at all
i'll be able to fix this at least a little bit once i'm done with my defense, but for people being affected harshly by quarantine, i'm sure it's just a complete nightmare
YIKES BRO
but yeah, i'm specifically trying to stay away from alcohol
not just because i'm in a critical phase of work, but also because i don't think i enjoy it very much anymore and also my feelings about work and life make me overindulge when i bother to get any
i found a variety of wine that's high alcohol content but somehow doesn't taste like it at all, very fruit
which is exactly what i've always wanted in wine, and now that i have it i recognize how dangerous it is
nice
well, you know you best
yeah, we'll have a positive time with it at some point
just not for the foreseeable future, because as soon as i'm done with graduate work i'm going back home to missouri
need to try and find a job in this nightmare of a shit fuck economic situation and then get out into a place of my own again
i hate moving, it's such a pain in the ass and i've done it like six times in the last decade
people wonder why my apartment is still pretty barebones, and it's because i've grown used to pulling all my shit down and putting it in boxes
why bother when i'm gonna have to do it again
i've tried enough beer now that i think i just firmly hate it
i'm sure there's a wider variety of flavor out there than what i've had, but the bitterness invariably makes me want to spit it out
oh no, for sure
i hate the taste of alcohol, i try very hard to mask it whenever i drink for fun
maybe someday, but not for the foreseeable future
fuck it, i need a round in the ripatorium before i get back to work
need something to get the blood pumping
this is awful
<:howlow2:676840417328889962>
not so good responses tonight
i'm sorry i'm not answering the linky command too well tonight
that was intentional bait for the linky command btw
and so was that
i would have added some appropriate 8ball-ish answers to it but i think frontloading it with that kind of thing is lame
we had that but it was fucking annoying
andrew got pinged like seven times in one day
that's a pretty good one, yeah
you should have seen the one it posted the other night, let me find it

i'm not sure this one will ever be topped
okay those are pretty good
also dingus i hate those images
commercial simpering and apologism needs to be wiped out with holy fire
simpering sounds too much like "simp" now, it's poisoned
<a:thinkingAction:525105620098088975>
thank mr skeltal
alright, this has officially gotten spammy
yeah veli i don't know
they get that linky in their veins and it takes off
this is fucking absurd
can the monky go less fast please
INTERESTING.
damn, that's not nice
we'll have to teach linkybot some manners
useless as usual
please don't be horny
also the command is specifically D--> linky
fair enough
okay seriously, stop with the dumb sex jokes
<a:Apogg:477348807563280385>
GET FUCKED IDIOT
yeah, my bad mines
alright, that's enough
no more linkybot for at least a few hours
or else i za warudo
actually isn't there a command for this
<@!125433170047795200> what's the command for deactivating linkybot
i forgot
oh yeah
god, that's fantastic
i think D--> fle% is still a usable command though
someone try it
haha, it disables it for everyone but mods
you are all subhuman
anyway, no more arquiusbot in here for a few hours
i need to work on my thesis and this is distracting the fuck out of me
my eyeballs are betraying me and i hate it
no, my defense is on monday
and then there's a two week period where my committee and i have to discuss the thesis and make any changes
i hate it
but yeah i think i'm gonna minimize the window, please act respectably while i'm gone
yeah mines, 11th at 11 AM
i both feel confident about it and nervous, i hate presentations
anyway, talk to you guys later unless i get distracted again
ree ree, etc
<@!699025796576313344> i'm watching you, shitposter
ALWAYS WATCHING
why did you share this
okay, that's enough shitposting for one night

do your jobs moderators, or else üî™
man, thinking about LISA again out of nowhere
i'm almost done with my studying so i'll wait to explain until after
alright that's enough for one day
fucking christ
let me get in bed and i'll elaborate pointlessly on why i was thinking about LISA
Wow, is discord fucking broken
Or is it just my laptop
Restarted it and now it can't even connect
sweet baby jesus, nevermind
apparently there was a huge spike in reports, yeah
what a grand and intoxicating ~~innocence~~ experience
no
provide
fuck you
why did i promote you to full mod
shame on you sweet nerevar
oh yeah, i was going to talk about LISA briefly
i don't know, i had the sudden inspiration to listen to pebble man because i've been listening to a bunch of gentle genres while i work
pebble man's got good grit to it
but the image they used for the video had the one joy monster on it, not overtly horrifying but still crepy
and i got this blinding flash of the one super secret boss in the truck
the one i didn't fight but looked up later
the description of the guy is frankly horrifying
i think LISA strikes me with how much wanton cruelty there is in it
the world is basically coming to an end and the few people who aren't drinking themselves to death over it just mercilessly rip into whoever they come across
kind of a horrifying reality for me to contemplate
i mean, i'm sure it's horrifying to anyone, but still
OOHUGH
OOHUGH
see, that's the thing too
it contrasts those really heavy and depressing themes with these moments of surreal and absurd comed
makes it way more effective when it comes to each tone
i fear LISA the painful
i don't know about joyfu
i mean, maybe singular moments, but it all gets washed out at the end
i think the implication is that ||the joy monsters are increasingly prevalent and are destroying anything that's left||
not much hope to be gleaned from that
except of course the very end, but that's a different deal
well yeah
i guess in that it's infinitely more optimistic than the ending of painful
you have to go through so much to get there though
OOHUGH
dude, the ending of it left me with this sense of thorough depression, but only for like a few days
i'm kind of thankful that it didn't leave a deeper mark than that
because some of that imagery is viscerally terrifying to me
OOHUGH
at this point i'm just loading up the bot with OOHUGHs
OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH
but yeah, it's been a while so the feeling is nowhere near as raw of course
but i still remember the hits
they just kept coming dude
especially that sudden realization of ||brad turning into a joy monster||
like, jesus fucking christ, this poor guy just never had a chance
oh god, and the credits
thinking about them is giving me chills right now
i hate that kind of subliminal imagery
maybe mines, but i think it also might contribute to the ending's impact a bit
if you hug him, it's like the last breath of hope before he fucking eats dirt
but if you don't, then it's just a crystallization of his total failure
either way, it's pretty intense
OOHUGH
i an't stop fucking listening to this
the story and execution are separate elements that are both done extremely well
i'd say go for it
never, i probably couldn't stomach it
you know, even outside of the general apocalyptic scenario, like before it and such? there's still pretty overt ideas of the world being an inherently cruel and awful place
like rando's face
and of course, lisa herself
i think describing it as a motivation of love is a reduction
while that's probably part of it, there's also a significant amount of trauma fueling his actions
yeah, even if i don't necessarily think it's love, he's still trying to do something right in opposition to his own childhood
he fucks it up really hard, but that's the nature of any parent child relationship i think
nern is a treasure
i'm sure you were supposed to become more familiar with other party members but i just couldn't
OOHUGH
russian roulette was the only time i lost a party member i think, and i specifically chose some dumb fuck i didn't care about
EASY COME EASY GO
fucking fardy
also i didn't realize that fatal attacks were ALWAYS fatal, like an instant kill no matter what
that's fucked up, i got really god damn lucky
good thing i didn't fight mike
that would have been a miserable encounter
if you cheese him sure
i never developed such strats though
fucking exploding crows
you mean highway king?
i would definitely say summer loving is a more iconic theme for brad, i don't recall highway king too much
but i guess it was a more generally distributed song
i'd like to invite anyone up with an especially warm memory of carlton
```xbox sex```
microsoft's handling of game releases is odd, to say the least
game pass is a neat idea but their execution is just absurd, last i checked
get with the program, use steam for everything
put gears of war on there
although you know, i guess the adage about "it's only good until they decide to be evil" applies
oh yeah, you were saying that
i need to pick it up here, once i'm done
it'll be good to play gears again
does it have any other bearing on 5 besides that
like, does the plot carry forward
jesus, really
i thought there was a pretty important development with whatever those robots were
but at least the devs knew where to cut their losses
ooh, now that's exciting
well, more or less
i think the original is unmatched in terms of tone
2 and 3 had too much big shooty shooty
but i liked the developments they had anyway
I NEED A TUMS
it does
for the first game, most of that writing is in the character dialogue though
i guess that applies to all of them really, but the first one especially has a lot of casual banter and excellent voice acting
THE COLETRAIN'S HERE
but yeah, i wonder if the first game holds up
like, technically
it's definitely clunky compared to its sequels
i need to check out xbox pass or whatever so i can actually play these games again
maybe we could get some co-op shit going
are all of them 2 players or did some have more, i don't remember
god damn it
people really need to open up their campaign multiplayer
halo 3 is the only thing that comes to mind with really solid 4-player multi
yeah but it's reach
SHOOT PUNCH SHOOT PUNCH SHOOT PUNCH
oh yeah, there was a lot of that too
but yeah, gears was really set apart from other shooters at the time because of that gore
they had a really good engine for it
just a complete explosion of blood and guts with the right weapons
they're not like earth shotguns, they're basically shrapnel cannons
everything in gears of war is like that
amped up versions of earth stuff
also yeah, it's just good gamefeel
the staple weapon of these soldiers is a combination rifle and chainsaw
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
can i just say i really hated the dom and his wife subplot
the emotional impact made sense but it never felt properly integrated into the overall story
whoa
seeing this gameplay again
that brought back a shit ton of memories
once i get out of here i'm definitely checking out xbox pass, if only for the gears games
god damn, i can't wait
it's going to be so fun to revisit that series
gears has a pretty deeply written world and has amazing game feel
no that's a real concept with meaning behind it
have you been listening to sensationalized youtuber bullshit again
makin wake up, the incident was 3 years ago
hoo, that got me good tensei
i'm pinning this unless you want to make a new version
jesus, did we ever pin the tier list
i need to update our pin list, fuck
there's so many good things
we never pinned that tier list
i can go with the old one unless tensei wants to update it or something
<:ree:475542526791516170>

<:FATYOSHI:347486321595645952> <:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
this post brought to you by the hydrohomies
alright, finally updating the pins list
i don't think we're near the cap but it's good practice anyway
there we go, pin list is fully up to date
time to clean house
sculptures in general kind of amaze me with the level of work put into it and the resultant detail
like those pieces where they carved the shape of cloth or anything that manages to look soft?
it almost makes you forget you're looking at what used to be a fucking chunk of rock
explain your sentiments, fool

never have i felt the words "personally attacked" so hard
yeah, that's the technique i've been trying to adopt
telling myself that no one cares, not caking everything with paint
though i should do that too
such words of wisdom
i interpreted it like two ways
1: "if you watched evangelion at the same age as shinji, you're now the same age as misato"
2: "if you grew up as an angsty reclusive child, you are now an adult who tries to be outgoing but is hiding sadness underneath"
yeah, burps are primarily gross if they're close to you and especially if you can smell it
the sound alone is basically whatever
i can't stop listening to buzz saying "bad" over and over again now
when i stop to think about it i don't really understand why i enjoy shit like this as much as i do
time to listen to YTPMVs for eight hours
what
of course i did
that's what i was talking about

waht in the fuck is going on
that report literally just happened
who is trawling 2 year old posts
musk's breakdown was like last week, right
nevermind, i suddenly do not want to try and puzzle this timeline together
yes
all i can say is BAD BAD BAD
no it's fine but i didn't laugh, it didn't tickle my funny bone for some reason
the part where he pisses in the mouth of the dude's severed head was entrancing in the worst way possible
you clearly missed the string of people naming their children shit like "abcde" and shit like "shithead" (pronounced shih-thay-ed) and "asshole" (pronounced uh-shol-uh) in like the mid 2000s
given how erratic musk is, especially when he's off his meds or whatever, i have no doubt that he actually named his child something fucked up
mah
kine
mahkine
test
okay thank god, discord was fucking up again
i'm late but the girugamesh meme was like 2009 right
yeah, because it was a promo for sakura-con 2009 or whatever
i've always wondered about this actually
when did the term "meme" actually attain popular usage
google trends will have the answer

that's amazing
so girugamesh was like a meme before people even started using that term
oh yeah, that makes sense actually
yes, that's kind of what i was saying
the word meme has been around since '76
but no one gave a shit before the internet explosion
no, i mean
there's a steady rise after 2013, but i don't think it corresponds to the release of mgrr
maybe it was related
but i think it was a component of a wider trend
what i want to know is what happened in february of 2012, yeah
if any of my older relatives use the word "meme" in real life i'm probably going to shit blood
memes were NOT huge in 2008-2009, it was relegated pretty much to people who used the internet on a regular basis
and those people were way, way less prevalent back then
i was one of those people and i was like 14
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-animals
2006 apparently is when they first started
but lolcats were like 2007 weren't they
we're all wrong, lolcats actually started in the 1870s
get fucked idiot
yeah, I CAN HAZ CHEEZEBURGER was when it really took off
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nedm
god damn
wow
this video is like an out of body experience now https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=rj1GFLtQ1mw&feature=emb_title

it's because it was novel
i used to find advice animals hilarious, when they were new and unprecedented
philosoraptor was my shit, back in like 2009
but everyone and their grandmother uses the internet now, and you can't keep laughing at the same shit forever
you have to keep looking for the bleeding edge of culture
the thing that gets me about the video that i shared is that it's over 5 minutes long
the actual joke part takes like 3 seconds
yeah, i know
i'm not trying to knock it
well i was approaching it more from the angle that
no one nowadays would make the video that long
i think people have become savvy enough with creating videos like this that they would make it like seven seconds long
actually, i think we can thank stuff like vine and tiktok for that
brevity is the soul of wit and all that
gangam style getting 1 billion views was a weirdly popular event
i distinctly remember that as one of the earliest online events that i actively had a conversation with people about in real life
jesus fucking christ, gangnam style has over 3.5 billion views now
i guess it has been 8 years, but still
oh yeah, despacito was the other one i was going to bring up
i can't fucking believe that there's a youtube video that has been viewed almost as many times as the world has people
also gangnam style is unironically a bop
i guess that goes without saying given how many times people have viewed it, but still
i haven't seen despacito 2 since it came out and it's somehow even funnier
weren't we already talking about doing a group server for it
i love being a summoner in terraria tbh
having multiple UFOs flying overhead
delightful stuff
you know, i think i really hate popular memes, especially nowadays
i think i see this format like four hundred thousand times every day
it's basically an image macro but even lazier
comedy necromancy
fine, i can turn linkybot on
but don't spam it or else
yes, people were abusing it last night
including myself
i guess i should actually try and watch space cop
i know it's bad, so is every other "actual movie" that RLM makes
but i feel kind of obligated
i wonder if i can find a way to group stream it
makin, we still read homestuck 2
i don't know what you expect from us
i read homestuck 2 because homestuck made me experience a range and level of emotion that nothing else has come even close to before or since, both as an isolated piece of media and through community engagement
a lot of my freetime since i read it initially has been looking around on the internet for stuff that can provide that level of stimulation and yet it never happens
homestuck 2 had the potential and now i'm afraid it doesn't
but like a ghost, i'm tethered to this reality until something happens and lets me move on
let me see if i can get space cop prepared quickly
i'm gonna do it
enough

watch out makin, the fbi's coming
https://twitter.com/Halo/status/1257717196114935810
this is _perfect_ timing for me
i don't know how it would be possible to recover from 5 unless they just completely started fresh or something
i guess the thing is that halo 1-3 covered an incredibly climactic event in that setting
like, the completion of a 100,000 year arc
so when you think about it, it's kind of hard to really conceptualize something that could hold up to that scale
how did they ruin what came before, exactly
you can just ignore that
IS
yeah, once it's set up
i literally just decided to do this, i'm almost done reencoding and then i have to upload it
yeah, you might want to skip out since you say it's that bad anyway
not worth staying up for a few hours
no, pretty sure it's not
die
i'll keep an eye on the progress and let people know as soon as it's ready to play
this'll probably be our lowest attended stream yet, who in their right mind wants to watch space cop
a ringing endorsement, truly
misha
no, what
how haven't you been banned yet
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
aaahhhahahhhh the french champagne...
video will be on google drive in a little under an hour, hopefully processing is quick
oh yeah, ripatorium is a thing
time 4 rip and tear
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
where did that come from
for some reason my eyes weren't tracking the game like usual when i started doom eternal up, and it gave me a very brief feeling of being sick to my stomach
which reminded me of times where my parents have had the same complaint
i wonder if there are any studies where they tracked eye movement of people playing games between those who play a lot and those who don't
what
the guy who said he was gonna edit fath usky getting beat up?
<@!327170675406274560> that's pretty fucked up
you're not actually going to do that, are you
you have five seconds to answer
alright goodbye
none shall desecrate fat husky
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
space cop is processing
not sure when it'll be done, i'll check frequently-ish
i should fiddle around with famitracker more, but i always lose interest
oh hey, space cop is ready
<@&693935623966425219> hey losers we're doing space cop in five minutes, get your butts in here https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight
doomp eet
dingus that panel genuinely looks like she got shot
i don't understand why she didn't get hit by a bullet
or maybe she did and she just recovered due to god tier?
but if that's the case it wasn't conveyed at all
wow, space cop really is bad
and yet a few parts of it are pretty decent
some of the effects mostly
oh my god, there's still 70 minutes of this film left
i underestimated how painful this movie would be
yeah, it's almost as bad as homestuck 2
FEED YOUR FUCKING FACE
```Ten celebrities with horrible physical deformities? Yes, click on that please.```
hm
you know, i think it's kind of a gray area
we do discuss homestuck fanventures and fics here
sometimes
usually talk about literature in general and especially whatever the fuck we want
i think it's fair to ask in here though
but yes, trizza does not have anywhere near the level of recognition that the main cast does
okay, the best moment of space cop by far: rich evans calls a little kid on a tricycle a "filthy cocksucker"
nothing
you just perish
also good god, that movie was fucking awful
misha said it best, the only part that i got any enjoyment out of was where they blow up a little kid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEF0m4-TdD4
i wonder what the difference is
i guess that kung fury was just totally unapologetic about what it was
it didn't try to tell a story, it was just 40 minutes of complete nonsense
<@!111477124384202752> are you still dead toda
not just gay, but Hella gay
no help, as usual
dddddddddddddddddd
sounds pretty toxic
get out jonah, you deserve better
die
yeah, space cop was fucking miserable
you didn't miss much
i was thinking of getting on lotro to show you attack skills but i should probably get back to work
then it must wait
<:howHigh:354512283038121984> wow, i never thought of that before
by-on-ih-cleez is a great pronunciation
what will the internet think of next
i don't think that's how that work--`NO FUN ALLOWED`
it's all so tiresome
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
do you ever tire of this existence
YOU GET
WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE
is it still that thorough a mystery as to why it happens
i don't know anything about babies
what's LI
thanks daniel, i appreciate you
also fair enough, i don't know much about new york and its geographical copmosition
THE KID FROM BROOKLYN DOT COME
<:dabeegMayahn:679423476268007424>
YOU EVER SEEN THEM SIGNS ON THE HIGHWAY
I'D WALK A MILE FOR A CAME
WELL LET ME TELL YA
THE BIG MAN WOULD WALK 20 MILES FOR A... ***QUAALUUUUUUUDE***
i think i've heard this before somehow
oh, no
i'm just
man, what in the fuck am i thinking of
i don't know mag, i guess that depends on what you think is good
oh my fucking god, you're literally still in the prologue
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
well, not a prologue by conventional standards of course
but functionally speaking
hm
there is good zinger dialogue, but not until you get to the third character who joins the party
that's where the dynamic of the main cast begins
and then it REALLY picks up with the addition of the fourth
ehh
i don't know about that
with regard to WTC in particular anyway
woc would definitely agree with you, he frequently bitches about people being "stockholm syndrome'd" into liking stuff
what, wtc
i was considering it from the angle of, "it introduces a lot of mechanical elements of various importance, which can be overwhelming"
which is definitely true of both works
with wtc in particular i think my eyes glazed over a lot of details of how the world works in the first read through
which, now that i'm reading it again, i realize has made me miss some more intricate details or foreshadowing
but it also didn't hamper my overall enjoyment of the work
<:howHigh:354512283038121984> no, it's definitely not a zombie work
you gotta bear in mind, the story is very long
and despite that, each chapter typically introduces some new concept of the world or progresses through a new story development
the realm of the story is extremely large, lots of parts involved
sure, i hope you begin to enjoy the story in earnest soon
i'm sure repeated claims of "it gets good later" aren't terribly reassuring in the moment
what the hell is shannara
god, i hate smart quotation marks
they don't show up all that often for me, but when they do it makes me tear my hair out
i might have to check that out cy
but i need to go back and finish the wheel of time
i got up to book seven or eight and then i got into graduate school, and i just fucking dropped books
the series is firmly concluded so new books aren't a problem
it's just so long
like several million words
4.4 million, christ
so it's like in that camp of post-lotr high fantasy, right
well no, you're still in the risen lands
let me see what chapter that whole thing ends
chapter 15 marks the first movement to a new area, and thus a new arc
or saga i guess
swag money
hm
i don't know that i would agree with his description
it's certainly part of it, but it's not the main draw
for me, the biggest draws are the evolution in how the main cast interacts with each other over time, especially with addition of new members to the fold
and then
i gotta try and find a way to condense this down
it's kind of like how tolkien had a thorough love for the world he built in his stories
and it was extremely fleshed out
you don't see every single part of it in the story, but you can get the sense of the completeness in its construction
wtc is kind of like that
you don't turn over every stone, but every stone came to be there somehow
indeed
you're in chapter 3 of 200
it always hurts when a story has a poor hook, is just the unfortunate reality
yeah, i actually had to keep telling myself to make it through the earliest chapters
when i was rereading
||when you consider it, it's not actually in media res in a way||
i don't know, isekais are weird in this regard
that would really suck to be honest
the tactical insertion of real life snippets that are related to what's going on in the actual story
if wtc didn't have that, it would easily be much worse i think
homestuck was not a linear experience by any means
don't tell him about nibbler OOPS
how dare you spoil a show that's over 20 years old
what's going on
why was i pinged
i don't mind dropping into altgen but pings usually mean something is going wrong
please don't do that again
wait, are you really just trying to get banned
can someone figure out what this is all about
<:annoyedPepe:347205246457610260>
you have a really boring understanding of what being an ape means
is this really what altgen is now
people lamely shitposting extremely casually and quietly
i miss when this place was just complete, unmitigated chaos
unfortunately we can't just totally remove mods, because then people end up posting stuff that breaks global rules
like genuine slurs and porn
i miss when we had a userbase that was able to spam relentlessly for hours at a time WITHOUT breaking rules somehow
also yeah we generally look down on cropped porn
anyway, good luck resuscitating altgen culture
if you aren't successful then i'm closing the channel down tomorrow
man, i wish it didn't have spoilers, because i would be linking magistrate to the council of arches sideplot
it demonstrates a lot of what i like about wales' writing
BAD
ON
PURPOSE
spoilers you fuck
magistrate has just started
yes, he's literally on chapter 3
or maybe they don't count, i don't know
but do not
this is fucking scary
cold and precipitation any day baybee
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
oh shit it's green gorl
what, am i wrong
but hey, how you doin
my lab has a meeting that's supposed to be starting literally right now, and i'm the only one in the zoom for it
i think everyone is dead
ut depends on the topic
angry about crrrrrrrrrrrrrr\
i'm so tired
notoriously not a morning person
also it's hard to say misha
the years start to blend together
sometimes i'm not sure when people started talking here
i thought tera was a new member a couple times but it's been around since super early
people from before my time are increasingly uncommon but still pretty fairly represented here
like, this channel specifically
i need to take that regulars list and list when they first started talking
but that's getting into obsessive territory
why must everything be weird
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
we know there's at least one
shout out to cruuk
silence, fool
my real name is <a:anumbersNUMBERS:394370289036820480>

there's a reason such things exist, unfortunately
koog
it's 40 years
nah man, forget it yo home to bel-air
if fresh prince can count, so can dante's inferno
i keep seeing jokes about dante's inferno being catholic fanfic
and my first impulse was to say "that might be an accurate joke but there's so much more to it than that"
looking up a summary though, there really is an absurd amount of fanfic tier writing in this story
```Dante encounters the poets Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, who include him in their number and make him "sixth in that high company".```
imagine writing a story and including yourself among the ranks of the most famous poets of all time
didn't the catholic church formally or informally adopt some of this shit as canon
well, i guess linky bot has spoken
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
perfect
did i ever mention that someone got back to me with the price quote for www.com and it was 40 million dollars
i didn't respond and they kept sending me emails like WOULD YOU LIKE TO DISCUSS PURCHASE OF THIS DOMAIN?
no, i think i'm good
what about thebigman.com
what
what the fuck is this about
why did you talk to a lawyer about this
no moon, i have no recollection of this in the slightest
holy fucking crap, this is the best thing i have ever heard in my life
what was the result
there better be a section called "The Hall of Quaaludes"
did the big man have anything even resembling an estate
he may have lived in brooklyn but i don't get the impression he was particularly affluent
i wish the domain wasn't fucking 2000 dollars
because i would immediately pitch in for this
my real name is already tied to my own website because i didn't know how to avoid that really
assume we were able to gather funds i wouldn't mind holding the domain
is it possible to reach out to his next of kin or something
maybe do some digging about his life, i dunno
probably not as insane as writing 700 pages of documentation about a community for an increasingly irrelevant webcomic
i really don't think it is, in terms of effort involved
and it's not like i would say that, i would just say that we really enjoyed his content and would think it's a shame if it disappeared someday
well, i'm going to file this away as "project for after i get my degree"
because i am definitely interested in preserving THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE
but it's not very high on my list of priorities, not until after may at least
it's too late for that makin
we are in the _shit_
objectivity doesn't exist here
that's actually a pretty apt comparison, although i would definitely disagree that it's worse
it's just way more popular, which by dint of reaching more people means that it nets more artists and people actually willing to do stuff with it
for the big man, we are those people, and possibly the _only_ people who are willing to do that
this is what it means to be an enthusiast, especially in a small niche like that
any details of his life that his family deems fit--HE HAS A BOOK?
I NEED IT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
that probably has all the contact info on it that we need, to be honest
or well, maybe not actually
publishing information certainly but i doubt they have copyright over his content
yeah no, this is probably far less weird than it sounds
especially if it's done in a respectful way, as moon said
i have to imagine that similar projects like this have been attempted but it was conducted by morons, so they failed or were otherwise a trainwreck
and that's not to say that our attempt won't be a trainwreck, but between moon, myself, and whoever else might be interested, we could actually have the tools to carry this out properly
the good news is that once the domain is purchased, the renewal rate seems to only be 9 bucks a year
this is so fucking stupid, i love it

old newspaper headlines can be pretty fun
"Men of Science More or Less Agog" is something i need to start saying
This
_Evil_
fucking killed me
that is an outrageously good find gnawms, thank you
this guy was REALLY pissed off about people using "you," i can't imagine saying that the use of the word for that purpose "debased the Spirits and depraved the Manners of Men"
must have been nice living back then when your greatest worry was whether someone was saying "thou" or "you"
you know, besides dysentery and small pox, and slavery
stuff like that
why do people even talk in terms of deconstruction of stories
who started that
can i have a pizza?
`no`
certainly fucking looks like it
anyway stop posting furry bait, it displeases me
that last one is fine
but anymore, and the knives come out
üî™
get at 'em lads
except that one really IS fucked up, jesus
all of this reminds me of fucking golu


and my personal favorite
look at that HAND
don't you just want to give him a high five
mines isn't invited to the fun house
i've seen that a few times now but i never actually took the time to examine it and understand just how off model it is
oh no, it's out of control
quick, post linkybot to compensate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VMKb2uWyCs
what, the one where andrew flies off a cliff right in front of me?
you should  have seen us during our first session
the legend of "poop ballsack" will never be forgotten
i really, really wish i had been recording that session
it's not just "poop ballsack" by itself that was funny
it was like a snowball effect really
so like, gimli is the dwarf in the fellowship of the ring
his father's name is gloin, which is fine
but gloin's father's name is groin
obviously we made fun of this for a bit
to the effect that we would occasionally ask "what's gimli's grandfather's name"
and then i don't know who, probably misha or andrew, responded to the joke at some point with "poop ballsack"
most of us completely ignored this the first time, but it just kept popping back up in conversation
oh yeah, it was probably dero
but anyway, for like an hour and a half, every so often we'd ask "what's gimli's grandfather's name" and we'd all say "poop ballsack"
tera must have missed the original joke because it was really confused as to why we were saying this
i think this is where i started laughing so hard that i had tears in my eyes
but then when we explained the joke, tera said "is that really his name??"
and then my sides rocketed straight out of this solar system
dero and i were laughing so hard that we physically could not breathe
fuck, just thinking about it makes me want to bust up laughing
i don't know why this exchange got me as good as it did, but i have not laughed at something that hard in like four years
full on unable to stop wheezing air, struggling to try and draw breath just to lose it again
i wish everyone could experience laughter like that at least once in their lifetime
also it was the brown, but good enough
fucking "poop ballsack the brown," gimli's grandfather
```"Why are you guys laughing?"

"It's Gimli's grandfather's name, Poop Ballsack."

"... Is that really his name??"```
i want an edit of lord of the rings where literally the single, solitary difference is that gimli's grandfather's name is poop ballsack
wew lad, i'm getting a headache just thinking about it, and this was like over a month ago
for me, life is just waiting for the next moment where i laugh so hard that i almost suffocate
yeah, it was a glorious start to the fellowship's journey tarty
too bad we hit that dry spell
lotro is just too much of a wow clone, it drives people off
yeah, i fucking suck
but i used my considerable affluence to buy my way to the top levels and now that will never happen again
i am now officially the party's gandalf
magic tho
i made a new character tera, i'm not delathrion anymore
yeah, i'm a high elf rune keeper named loloron or some shit
like the only "true magic" class or something
shut up, that's not it
anyway, we basically made it to moria, except it's instanced so we'd have to beat a quest or some shit
we can just go over caradhras instead, which is where all died at the end of our last session
now that i'm level 120 i can instagib basically anything
wat
well then what the fuck is the point
MISTY MOUNTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINS
yeah sure, why not
i can keep the party safe from most shit i think
sigh
i hate that so much of the world is levelgated
lotro would be genuinely fun to explore without combat
at a certain point it just starts taking too long unfortunately
i almost quit a few times because i just detest the gameplay and especially how long it takes to make significant progress
i understand it can go quickly depending on how exactly you go about it, but i do not care
the actual gameplay loop fucking sucks
wat
goodness fucking gracious, every once in a while i go to listen to fantasia, and the final sequence with night on bald mountain and ave maria gives me massive goosebumps every time
that movie is a perfect thesis on the marriage of sound and visuals
i wish that people utilized the concept more often, baby driver kind of scratched the itch but not nearly enough
<:jackBluh:585537437489561601>
i've wanted to stream it for a very long time
it's not exactly a good stream movie, but it's worth watching
uh
what
no you fuck
you will perish
NOT MY EYES
inb4 would you make me a sandwich
oh hell yeah, i love that game
spencer launches a bagel is honestly a pretty emblematic example of a particular style
i don't like earblasting typically, but it honestly does a pretty good job at it
maybe because it's employed at just the right moments
wanton earrape just pisses me off
SCRATCH
GRRROUNDER
i miss this tv show
chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
MASTER WILLIAM
the camerawork for the first episode of fresh prince is
different
i haven't seen the show since the early 00's
i've seen fesh pince enough that i figured it was worth looking at the pilot at least
probably better, yeah
some other time though
yes
it was good but i probably wouldn't watch it again, at least not for a while
despite the fact that i watched it some time ago, most of the plot points are still really fresh in my mind
what in the fuck
hillary is talking about the ozone layer and global warming
this pilot is FUNKY
this first episode has a fancy dinner scene and the two pieces of music they're using to represent fancy is fur elise and vivaldi's spring
i love it
no, it's just silly in how stereotypical it is
already tried watching dexter
didn't enjoy it
<@!125433170047795200> i don't have the whisker fish image, i need to save it next time you ask me to speak to the whisker fish
but as it is
<@!226517338567081985> do you have anything to say to the whiskerfish
he will listen to what you wish to tell him
this is the most awful thing i've ever seen
and i've seen a lot of terrible shit
have this to wash the stink out https://youtu.be/Lr6AVJ9bFvY?t=10
holy shit, i just noticed something in fesh pince i've never seen before
in the scene with the celebration of robertson winning the seat of judge and he goes "THERE GOES PHILLIP BANKS"
the visual is in reverse just until he says the word "phillip"
there are so many small details to these videos, what the fuck
spencer launches a bagel, at your fingertits, all of durhamfrankerz's king of the hill stuff
kroboproductions's fesh pince and steven jewniverse
yeah, at your fingertits is really fucking good
there's a quality to it that i'll have to think about for a bit before i can actually describe it in full
but it's worthwhile
i'll have to go look at it as soon as i'm done with fesh pince, but i'm not sure i agree with that
i do agree that the edits don't hit as hard most of the time but there's not that much dead air
or at least, the dead air is only comparable to wow it's made
which i don't actually care for too much
yet, wow it's made would probably be on the list
i'm not saying it wouldn't be, i need to watch price is rice
i was really busy last night and have been for most of today, my defense is on monday so i was getting shit done
but i'll take a look at price is rice here
well it has craig ferguson in it so i'm already sold
"I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING OONNNNN"
instantly got me
oh fuck is that geoff the skeleton
was he also on price is right
HE WAS
THAT'S FUCKING GREAT
god i love craig ferguson
oh yeah, secretariat
this YTP automatically has so much going for it
it's SWEEPER MARKET SOUP
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
what a sad end for pickle man

COME AND LOOK UPON THE HEART
UPON THE HEART
OH
OH
OH
OOOOHHH
what a grand and intoxicating innocence
wow, i had totally forgotten everything about parsmont
i don't even remember how this saga ends
rereading wtc has been an excellent use of my free time
stop making stupid sex jokes
for god's sake
i like some tracks from starbomb a lot, but i'm really not fond of a lot of them
the second album i never listened to again
the castlevania, metroid, mario, zelda, and street fighter songs are all pretty enjoyable
everything else SUCKS
i think dan's voice is great within a particular range, but if he falls too low or spends too much time high then it's not good
it's sad in the sense that it was a low point in my life
my brain was in a state of total loss to my natural impulses
just consuming endless bred, day after day
like an animal
i have not BEGUN to peak
happy borth husk
i have no earthly idea why, but this reminded me of niklink https://i.redd.it/2nysb96wdjx41.jpg
like, just the study of soil itself?
you're going to laugh, get ready for it
it's called "pedology"
it comes from the greek word for soil, "pedon"
anyway, holy shit
i missed it on 4/13 but RLM trailer for a plinkett review of star trek picard
i cannot wait
<@!120187484863856640> sorry i'm missing fringe, conferring with my lab about stuff for my defense on monday
just count me out this weekend, i have too much stuff on my plate
i'll catch up next week in my free time
yeah, that's a new one for me too
sounds like a complete nightmare
i drank sour milk once and i've been frightened of the possibility ever since
i don't like this story
it's making me frown
jesus christ
why
i also typically don't drink milk anyway now, but i use it for cooking
jesus christ this bitcrunch makes me fear for my life
i'm quaking in my boots rn
CLEFAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
biririda made me laugh
it just reminds me of the enchilada complex
just like god intended
aw, that's adorable
man
i realy, really wish that the pokemon tabletop session i was a part of had kept going
every time i see classic pokemon sprites i'm like "god damn, it was so fun doing more in-depth stuff"
PTU is pretty okay, even if the combat is outrageously convoluted at times
if we could homebrew a simpler combat system it'd be nice
but the complexity is almost kind of necessary given how much shit is going on
but i had a nice magnemite, a teddiursa
i felt bad though because i always hogged RP time with NPCs
excuse me, a what
GO TO BED - TO BED
me too, bud
me too

BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE
BUT GO TO BED
NATURE BOOOOOOOOY
how else do you suggest i study dirt
i need to really root down and meld with it
that's just science, baby
depends on a few things
what soil type and how moist is it
soil that was wetted recently will smell different because of a sudden increase in the amount of carbon dioxide it's giving off
this is because there are a lot of bacteria in the soil that fucking die when it gets wet too fast
so their nutrients get released into the soil and other bacteria take it up, increasing the rate of microbial respiration
it's a way of figuring out how much carbon is in your soil samples
anyway, my point is that the answer to your question will drastically differ depending on the exact scenario
yeah basically daniel
and also i mean, it smells funky when it rains anywhere to be fair
virginia though probably has a pretty unique community makeup of bacteria in the soil
like, i imagine it's at least slightly different from georgian soil
and that also include region type, like mountains versus forest versus pasture
virginia is mountainous here
it's nice
yeah, i went to virginia beach a couple years ago
or was it last year
either way, i was on the coast and had a really nice time watching a cargo ship way out in the water, and some parasaillors
that word doesn't look right
anyway, it was delightful, and i learned a lot about how soil forms over time
all of the soil next to the beach is fairly new, because of sand blowing in
once you get into the loblolly pines some miles away from the beach, the soil is a few tens of thousands of years old
and it begins to form stratified layers that are distinct from each other, thanks to the introduction of organic matter with all the pine needles and shit
then once you get to the region of virginia i'm in with all the mountains, it's been going through the process of erosion and decomposition for like tens of millions of years
a lot of the rock in the mountains of virginia is limestone, which erodes into a very fine, rich soil that goes down for a few feet before it becomes bedrock
i think anyway, i was just a teacher's assistant in that class and didn't learn as much as i would have liked
i don't know what the luray caverns are unfortunately
i've never taken a proper geology class i'm afraid
i did take advanced soil microbiology as a graduate course
oh, i'm sure lots of caves are limestone
it erodes more quickly with water
has to do with the chemical composition
dissolves in water pretty easily, making a slightly basic solution
man, those look great
we have some caves like that in missouri, they're pretty much tourist traps
yeah basically barkley
to be more specific they're the result of really slow moving water
not great amounts of it, which would carry the material off
but a drop here or there
it takes somewhere on the order of millions of years for it to make those formations, just carrying a little piece of rock in each drop
the earth is pretty metal
har har
fuq u
anyway i didn't meant to go on a huge science rant
i guess i forgot how much i liked talking about this stuff
it's nice to know how the natural world works
i wish i enjoyed talking about my current project a bit more
i'm not actually into soil all that much
besides the fact that i get called a dirt sifter, i've never been particularly interested in it
yeah but talking about spat would be explicitly masturbatory
i try not to jack myself off too much, you know
already saw it, you are a fucking wiener
are they?? i was going to say
woc demodded for being a shite
cellular and molecular biology
minor in chemistry, was going to minor in german but i had a really traumatic experience with a friend who also took german classes and i stopped
the switch mafia
yeah, i've wanted to be a scientist since i was like 9
but also being a scientist fucking suuuuuucks
so i'm probably done with that, at least until i try something else and figure out i hate it even more
<a:eyesshake:526187606610804737>
the switch lite is actually genius, i'm pretty sure there's a large volume of people who don't bother with docking their switch and so the reduced price tag for a solely mobile version was a no-brainer
kind of like the 2DS
aw man, english can be so fun though
one of my favorite classes in undergrad was world literature, although i guess that's not strictly english
oh god
nevermind, that sounds like hell
what kind of anthropology course did you take
oh, so a cultural course
that sounds neat as hell
i took an anthropology course but it was human prehistory, mostly paleontological
i was completely enraptured with that course
i've told this story before though, where i stayed after class to talk with the professor about it a bit
she was badass and had been all over the world doing non-profit help and research on primates
one time she was like "you know maybe we should get lunch sometime so it's easier to talk about this stuff"
and i was really excited about this but worried about the ethical concerns about it? so like a fucking socially braindead idiot i was like "haha yeah that's great, but it won't be like a date or anything"
trying to reassure her i wasn't getting the wrong idea
she completely stopped talking to me, i was so mortified
i still think about that incident sometimes and it makes me want to die of shame
i've had a scant few interactions like that and it just makes me feel dead inside
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
yeah, i'm mostly over it
shit happened like five years ago, i can't keep giving myself grief over stuff in the past
doesn't stop me from agonizing over it sometimes but that's just life
thank you moonjail, that's exactly how i feel
but man
human prehistory was such a fucking bomb diggity course
i still remember plenty of details from it
easily in my top three courses i took
what a fucking horrifying thing
can you imagine being that seal
it's irrational but i fear polar bears more to be honest
i'm probably never ever going to encounter a polar bear in the wild but they are such fearsome animals
damn, i've never seen a bear or anything wild predatorial animals
granted
also for some reason that video of the finnish guy reminded me of this, not sure why https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLu2CFDBJk0

say hi to beeg
i don't want to click on that video
oh, okay
the embed just looked like a video, whatever

roanoke is a really sad place
i've taken flights out of there a couple times but roanoke the town is just kind of pathetic
it has the potential to be a bigger hub than it is but they squander so much shit
they have a "museum" i've never been to and never will
virginia's south of the mason dixon, right
i always forget
i need to get out of here
and go to the OTHER state i've lived in that was a slave state
```ashes to ashes, dust to dust```
i've already done that actually
there's a taco bell a couple blocks down the road
it was minus the camo part, and i was really drunk at the time
but i needed those fucking cinnamon twists
HSDcommwatch can suck my fat bnuts
what's that at, let me see

oh yeah, that's right
i forgot
that is probably my favorite dream story to be honest
for the sake of the bot, i shall now retell the dream i'm speaking of
i once had a dream where i adopted a black kid because he had a dollar and i needed it for change
tarty's irish so it doesn't count
are you scottish?
alright, sorry for mixing that up
i have accent dyslexia
the accident was five years ago, i need to wake up
the accident where i told my teacher we weren't going on a date
it's time to let go
no, it's a measure of precision
yeah that too

i still can't parry his shit and never bother to try
i hate parrying in dark souls
maybe that'll be different now that i'm used to sekiro

if you aren't making the game 100 times harder than it needs to be just for the challenge, then why bother living

i just took a step back and consciously considered the fact that internet culture has shifted severely over the last decade
how i interacted with people on the internet 10 years ago doesn't even vaguely resemble how i do it now, although i feel like this group still displays some vestige of that older culture
probably because of a large number of people who were actually around for it
i wonder what the internet will look like in another 10 years
hopefully not some kind of dystopic nightmare, though it could be argued we're there already
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
i don't know, i think this is oversimplifying matters
i guess ultimately it depends on what individual people value though
you'd think there would be a strict weight towards policies and ideas that are concerned with improving the quality of life people in general
exact ideas of how that works may differ, but i think it's obvious that policies that are preferential towards one race or whatever are a problem
well, apparently it's not
because roughly half of active voters don't think that protections are necessary for the minority
i think that's fundamentally illogical
so... what i'm getting at is that despite psychological differences in assessment, there is a deeper kind of truth to how to perceive and analyze these things
just because white people _feel_ like they need to be defended doesn't mean that statement is actually correct
i'm increasingly agitated by having to hedge things in terms of individual opinion, as opposed to finding a more concrete assessment of stuff
at some point you're going to run up against the wall of "everything is an opinion, nothing is correct"
which is basically a rational dead end
i'm not interested into validating subjective ideas that suggest one person is less valuable than another
yeah, i guess gitax
i also wanted to point out that i was speaking in broad terms
like, "not placing more value on one person over another" is specifically with reference to the idea of _inherent_ value
i don't think that one human has inherent value over another
BUT
the actions and intentions of a person can influence their value
how you define value differs from person to person, but in slightly less broad terms it can be relegated to impact on other people, the extent and nature of that impact
does a person cause more harm or good to other people? how many?
nah forget
i'm just spinning my wheels
why
ah
alexander scott had a good article on this i think
about how the nature of conversations on the internet shifted with increasing usage
can't believe i'm recommending slate star codex
but regardless, let me find it
i'm not sure there are stupid questions
i tend to think of unconstructive or bad questions as "harmful" more than stupid
but i guess the two aren't mutually exclusive

i was talking about the furry posting
or furry adjacent stuff
there's too much of it lately
we're starting a crusade
furries are excommunicado
DEMODDED
DEMODDED
NONE OF YOU ARE FREE OF SIN
seriously though, what's the relative population size of furries
how did half of our mod team become furries
no i mean in terms of overall human population
how many of those people identify as furries
like less than a percent?
less than a tenth of a percent?
none
wait, is that actually a standalone meme
the ugly disgusting part
i know it from a screenshot gnawms sent in a different server once
is the original "give me 200 dollars?"
fuck
of course

pretty sure it's real
the first time i saw that i laughed so hard i was choking on my own breath
gnawms has this really peculiar quality to him that just gets my funny bone real good
death to you
haha firecrackers go bang
are we talking per capita here
jesus fucking christ
i don't think it'll get better than that

we need to exercise pinning power more often
there are tons of good things in this channel, why not
<a:eyesshake:526187606610804737>
i didn't see it, but what's the origin of the format
shut up br
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

the true homestuck was the stories we ruined along the way
you should, it's emotionally devastating

i have never seen this gary's mod dilemma, jesus christ
i've never thought that a kid had a punchable voice before
MY BROTHER WORKS FOR STEAM hoo boy
fuuuuuuuck i need my doom fix
maybe i should try a master level
no more of that snowclone for today
we've already sent like four hundred billion of them
woe unto you who dares defy me
we can't get rid of that because it's stylistically meant to be that way, but we can at least try to mitigate it a little bit
you know, it's like poetry, it rhymes
i think that WAS the last update for act 2
lmao, i hadn't actually
that's great though carl, thank you
also gnawms means the uh
the writer releasing a written version of the events after episode 2
if you still think we're ever getting half life 3, especially after that, i have a bridge in my backyard to sell you
for all intents and purposes that is half life 3
I SPENT A BILLION MOBIUMS
let me see what chapter 4 looks like again
oh yeah, okay
everybody asks is it worth the candle, but nobody asks... _how_ is the candle
aye
what can i do for you
what, like ethically
what level of "went wrong" are we talking about
uhh
maybe look into the demon core
but i don't know if that would count as an experiment
yes, stanford prison experiment is a pretty universal example
methodology seemed fine but it led to results that people have condemned as "inhumane"
such is life

holy shit, that would actually be kind of funny
we'd have to assign people to specific vocal parts though, because there's a pretty wide vocal range going on
i'd probably just do the part with duncan or whatever his name is
i might be able to do skeletor, for some reason i have a really nasally falsetto
let me try it out
hm
maybe, it'd take some practice

yeah, you gotta load the bot with good stuff sometimes
otherwise you die
i'l give you one guess who i'm talking about

it's because all the white people are FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT

i might have to spend some time doing that this summer
also woc, beta 2 for fleet carriers starrs monday
yes
i've gotten as far as digging into the caverns
i'm not completely helpless, just autistic
you racist fuck
i'll definitely try to pick dwarf fortress back up after i'm done with school
i'll probably ask for some help if that's okay though
the interface is confusing to me
THERE IS NO ESCAPE
i am desperately tempted to try and fit a shitpost from here into my defense
something small and subtle
i'm just thinking of any possible place i could fit "no recall or intervention" into my presentation
yes, i remember you saying something to that effect
good shit
you know, i wonder if i could make a cutout of dagoth ur that is just super low opacity and overlay it on the background of one of my slides
maybe put him in the corner of all of my slides
a little transparent dagoth ur
or a fat husky
NO RECALL OR INTERVENTION CAN WORK IN THIS PLACE
THERE IS NO ESCAPE
yeah exactly gnawms
i'll find a way to make this work dammit
PANIC
fuck you
all of your lives are forfeit
when i get done with my defense on monday, i'm drinking three energy drinks
and then your asses are mind

if someone is being an asshole i think we generally appreciate it far more if someone just says that outright
talking about stuff openly is integral to how conversations here work
that rankles with people sometimes, but it's an important feature of the channel
SPEAK YO' MIND
is there that much depth to the phrase "mhm"?
i just take it as gentle yes

where's the beef
URGNG
does anyone else go "grug" in casual conversations? no? just me?
mmmmmmmmmmm
_whoa_
who are the people i talk to in here about vaporwave
because i just found a track that i really fucking like
something about it slaps my soul just right

shut the fuck up
i can't believe i just endured a joke where the punchline is "liquidwave"
my entire life is a shambles now
BWEP BWEP BWEP BWEEEEEEEP BWEP
tarty that makes me think of the angry kermit post
which i heavily agree with by the way, angry kermit poster is the true hero we all need
also they were thinking SEX SELLS MISHA
WHAT'S SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
ARE YOU SAYING YOU _DON'T_ WANT TO FUCK THAT M&M?
nani?
i have a headcanon that the blue m&m is african american
IT'S HAPPENING
the verbal way of saying them is "mnm" because that's easier than saying "m and m"
but the actual name is m&m
don't be a cock
i think m&ms got seared into cultural consciousness in part because of the christmas commercial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE8CJwXSPRs
you must crush
blue is pretzels
might also be mini m&ms? i'm not sure
green is mint
blue is pretzel orange is pb
fuck it, why are we not just looking this up

i'm kind of flabbergasted that this marketing has actually worked so well for them



WHAT
oh my god, you're right
this is like my version of the betty crocker meltdown
what foul hell have we stumbled onto
CINNA-MON
jesus fucking christ, 90s and '00s marketing is mind numbing
i actually watched food fight
that movie is a nightmare
JUST PLAY UPWARD BRO
we should definitely watch the rest of the transformers movies
it's like a cultural experience steeped entirely in being as awful as possible
memories shared with each other that we'd rather not have in the first place
what's not to love
that's the spice
i think there's five movies total, so two left
let me look it up
there's age of extinction and last knight, i know for certain
bumblebee has a standalone movie apparently
wait a minute
```Bumblebee is a spin-off film centered on the Transformers character of the same name. It was a intended to be a prequel to the film series, and later declared to be a reboot of the franchise.[105] Following the film's critical success, Hasbro intends to continue and evolve the franchise similar to Bumblebee.```
what the fuck? they _rebooted_ the transformers movies? <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i don't know why this fills me with such glee
>swamp dirt
<:hyperOwO:366718383783411734>

yeah, that was a big part of the ultron show or whatever it was
optimus would combine with other autobots and they'd wreck ass

me too, lady
convergent evolution
all atari games looked like that
the atari was a huge piece of shit
we can only hope
god, i can't wait to be done with school shit
it's gonna be nice to sit down and pursue all the shit i actually like
and talk more in here
there are SO MANY NEWER PEOPLE that i need to ruthlessly dissect and understand
all for the glory of SPAT
i'm finishing up grad school
like, i have my master's defense tomorrow morning
silence <:phil:523535182742028300>
big mcthankies
that's a smart husky
not quite fat, but smart
I MUST INSIST ON PEEPS
i'm not doing yet, i have to get done with work
maybe start sometime this week, or when i move back home
there are many newer users that i want to become more familiar with
i've been slacking
none, because they are disgustingly sugary and feel gross in my mouth
i have now overlayed dagoth ur onto every single slide in my defense
his face will stare into the eyes of every non-believer
upon looking again at all of my slides, i think that the textures of dagoth's face are too obvious
i tried practicing a bit and in particular his nose and eyes made it look like my screen was bent or scratched
i think it'll be too distracting for me and the audience, but i kept good ol' dagoth for the title slide
he'll get his tribute
there's way too much text for me to realistically do that unfortunately
also i'm running up against the end of my practice, in the sense that there aren't anymore modifications i want to do to the presentation
i just gotta practice it for tomorrow morning and hopefully not fuck everything up dramatically
that's feasible
i'll see what i can do
i wonder how opaque i can make his face if i stick it into a pile of compost
what are you talking about, totally can't tell
okay but see, look at this
unless you know what to look for, no one is going to see that
you're no fun at all
blargh, whatever

perfect
dude it's practically invisible
do people just have better eyes than i do
curse people with adequate vision
what do you mean though
also bear in mind that this is only going to be taking up one small piece of one of my slides
<:loss_jpg:354791933375152129>
i can't believe this
there's no way you guys can actually see it THAT WELL
there's gotta be some bias based on the fact that you specifically know i inserted something into the image
like, this is the full image
i am 99.9999999999% certain that no one in the audience would be able to see that
primarily because they wouldn't even KNOW to look for it
"why did you represent all of your numbers in this fucked up manner"
"you fail your defense"
bah, you guys have convinced me this is a terrible idea
if i didn't care nearly as much as i do about not fucking this defense up, i would leave it in or make it even MORE blatant
but i've been terrified for the better part of a month that i'll ruin this, so i'm playing it safe
dagoth ur in the title slide, but nowhere else
god, i just deleted it and it's like there's no difference at all
i think you people are bullshitters
body text: "kick his ass"
this is the actual worst thing i've ever seen
sometimes i see things like this and it puts the scale of my failures into proper scope
like, i may not be the smartest person on earth but at least i'm not recommending a recipe where you shove a frankfurter into a turnip and shove it up your ass
not enough times
WAIT - HE ISN'T DEAD
SHIA SURPRISE
i really should call this public mod hangout
imagine me saying that as the cat from that meme about "i should buy a boat"
yeah i guess
you know, i bet that openly advertising this place as a hangout space for mods would attract a bunch of unsavory types
part of the attraction here is the obfuscation to people who aren't willing to pry further
join me tomorrow as we discuss how to specifically exclude people we don't like by making them feel like shit

why not, there's a lot of indi--CANCELLED
there's at least one bollywood movie that i feel like streaming, but it would take a lot of effort for me to actually cross that line and get them prepared for streaming
and i feel like the novelty would wear off really fast, depending on what it is we watch exactly
there's only so many times you can watch supremely over the top action sequences
oh yeah, i forgot halo 2 anniversary is being released this week
fleet carriers today too
god, what an action packed week
passed my defense
jesus fuck it's like a sack of bricks just lifted off my shoulders
yeah it's a master's

in _my_ mspa-lit?
it's more likely than you think
i passed my defense
i am now Master of Dirt
yeah, i've felt pretty good about it all day
the euphoria passed pretty quickly but i'm still cruising
i mean, the key part of that is "we're friends," i know to expect some ribbing from you about how worthless graduate school is
but in general, it's a pretty big commitment for people, try not to be a wiener about it is all

this feels like a weird twist on /r/shittysuperpowers
proceed
_his name is pietro_
man, that's eerie timing
i'm just getting to the chapters with heshnel and the others
that's a weird phrase considering it's continuously coming out with new content, but still nice
do you have any particular thoughts to share
how dare you
not even a description of your favorite memes?
heartless
fair enough i guess
i definitely agree with regard to getting worse as they went back though
then they found their stride around when jay fixed his haircut and beard
there's also a persistent whining noise if you listen for it
but only when one of them speaks
one of them had a fucked up lapel microphone
it still annoys the shit out of me whenever i go back to watch old episodes
i didn't know they actually had a name for this kind of thing
makes total sense
i might have to check some of these out, i love music that i just put on in the background
or, well
i knew that ambient music was a thing, but not something that people really strove towards as an art form
i thought it was like a side effect at most
aight, it's on
turn 360 degrees and walk away
i can always count on you ktrao
interro, this music is
exquisitely passive
i have a lot of thoughts on that topic tm but i'm not in a state to answer your questions right now
IN ORDER TO HELP ME GET LARGE
NOW THAT I'M GROWN I EAT 20,000 EGGS
AND I'M ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A REPUBLICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
the difference is that one of them is actively doing it and the other is passive
wow, i'm missing some excellent conversation in here tonight
shame
let me crawl into bed so i can participate
dude i've been feeling bored all day, i understand
if i had known we were talkin' STONKS in here i would have joined sooner
i'll brb
alright let me read backlog
<@!205026834205769748> stupid dumb
what if someone's conception of infinite happiness WAS being able to do whatever they wanted
that would be a plausible afterlife
ah, the solipsist route i see
your life is forfeit
that's probably what a solely utilitarian afterlife would be
"maximal happiness? just overwhelm them with endorphins"
kind of like when i was on acid to be honest
if it was just that, forever, with none of the usual drawbacks, then i think that'd be a pretty solid afterlife
cuz there was still room for contemplation, you know
it wasn't just me drifting in an ocean
i was also consciously taking in everything
but the barrier of my inhibitions for enjoyment were like completely gone
it was incredible
i'm less averse to chemical manipulation of my mind i guess
as long as it's not something irreversible
like addictive or scarring
anyway, point is i would be fine with that afterlife
but i guess the idea is it could get tiresome at some point
so maybe an ideal afterlife would need to be mutable
```mutability is created by evolution so humanity isnt stagnant```
i'm fucking astounded at how profoundly nonsensical this is
you never cease to amaze me carlarc
no, it's not the basis for life
i've complained about similar sentiments in here before
life and evolution aren't like these tangibly forced things that operate under some kind of guiding principle
they follow physical and chemical laws, but the actual progression of life and evolution is basically random
did you specifically say "semantics" there because we use it as a buzzword to kill peoples' arguments
oh, sure carl
i guess i was confused because i thought originally you were also arguing about happiness,  but you were talking about infinite strength
i guess this whole conversation is turned around in my head
but also at the same time, i think that your distinction is only superficially helpful
because we're kind of necessarily operating under the principle that the afterlife would have to be idealized life and not just this thing that bypasses natural laws
if you're willing to supercede what real life is like, then who fucking cares
you can do whatever you want
the true challenge is answering a question but using all of the same constraints that real life would have
fucking gottem
well, ostensibly earth c was meant to be a place free of strife
both internal and external
but at some point homestuck got a bug up its ass about being a strictly metatextual work
and now it's a slave to that concept
as time goes by, i'm starting to agree more and more that where homestuck irreparably went off the rails was when john got his retcon powers
it was a step too far in expanding the scope of the story
we were already navigating through unbelievable stretches of space _and_ time
adding the very fabric of the story itself into the mix was pretty neat at the time but it opened up the story to too much bullshit that's manifesting now
John: kill your younger self and stop Homestuck from happening.
i think that's a pretty convoluted interpretation of what was going on
unless you're just referencing the like
time looped aspects of it
predestination and all that
i still prefer the interpretation of it just being these disparate groups of people who are all trying to meet up together irl
bound together by a common element, trying to indulge in their friendship as much as possible
i don't know that they were actively fighting predestination for most of it though
that theme is certainly prevalent leading up to cascade, but before that? not so much
it was more them just bumbling into shit
at least with john and jade
they were both pretty accepting of the situation
dave and rose it's more arguable
again though, only later, once they have a grasp of their situation and have accrued some experience
yeah, see what i mean
that's definitely a much stronger point imo
seeing as it encompasses so much of what was happening
but like, what about the troles
what about the troles, cy
what is this kind of literary analysis called, if anything
because my first instinct when i see these kinds of assessments is to be like "that's contrived bullshit"
something about it rankles me
even though logically, it makes sense
maybe i'm just too autistic
i've been thinking of reorganizing spat a little bit
like, the timing was a bit off originally
but
it just makes sense to move the "conclusion" of spat to the part where makin stepped down
because that's an incontrovertible change to the heart of the community
would make sense to make everyhing after that "spat 2" in a sense
february
i "ended" spat back in july last year
how did you miss this
i've been the admin for like three months
yeah no, i'm in complete control of everything
also i don't know who precisely would be interested in this, but my friend alexa wants to play LISA for the first time on stream sometime soon
in case anyone wants to see that
i'll shill it when it happens, like the shameless bastard i am
it was complicated
it turned out that the accusations against us (we're a pedo ring, we abuse minors, etc) were a complete fabrication by this piece of shit lowlife called phoebe
who had specifically created those claims to try and foment discord (ha ha) between us and homestuck twitter
specifically makin and kate
she was successful and it led to kate amping up this absurd hate campaign against us, amplifying those claims
hussie reached out and we entered discussions about why this was happening and what could be done to stop it
we shared the evidence that it was a disinformation campaign and that was more or less stopped
but hussie, makin, and i all agreed that the fact things had escalated as badly as they did meant that the level of trust was so low that something needed to change in order to prevent it from happening again
i have a lot of serious reservations about how it went down, but honestly it could have gone way worse too
i'm not going to offer any details that i think would be harmful to ongoing peace or whatever
makin was never actually malicious in what he was doing is the thing
he got shafted hard
i don't really think i should talk about that
i don't know mines
you know how i feel about all of it
it's just
you can't see it, but i'm gesturing vaguely with my hands
it's a lot of shit
january and february sucked
it feels like most of the overall community managed to escape from the drama, and i guess that's the important part?
actually no, let me be more firm
it was good that most people didn't have to deal with any of that
why
what does "deprecated" mean in this circumstance
kidpen, i don't think you'd be able to do that
kate deletes a lot of her tweets, especially the ones that start controversy
well
i don't know much of anything about mastodon except what someone was saying in the user contributions to spat
i believe that was cy actually
but i seriously doubt it can be as bad as twitter no matter what it's like
so if that improves the quality of discussion in the fandom then i'm all for it
whether that's through obfuscation or through a difference in the structure of the platform, doesn't really matter to me
thank fucking god
what are posts like
well
expanded character limit would probably help
twitter is absolutely useless for any sort of constructive conversation
mostly due to the character limit
i haven't looked at it myself but this gives me the impression of something a bit more homegrown than homogenized, like the major platforms
like people have to construct the particulars themselves, right
instead of just relying on an overall format
that's nice then
i've been missing the feel of when the internet was comprised of a lot of smaller webdomains you had to find
it's part of why i made my own website
well, social media kind of sucks, so good
maybe we'll hear less about homestuck twitter crowd then
i wouldn't be opposed to that, i dislike some of the things they idealize
obscurity isn't necessarily bad, depending on what exactly you're trying to accomplish
if it's just for posting personal things then it's more than fine
if you're trying to obtain some measure of success then it's definitely bad
but i'm not getting the impression that they're like
how should i say this
this doesn't feel like something that would impact homestuck 2 itself, so who cares
cy
comparatively speaking, no one uses mastodon
in terms of relative abundance, it's loosely reddit, twitter, and facebook, maybe something else i'm not aware of
and then mastodon is somewhere like less than a fraction of a percent in total usage
just by dint of how often i hear about it
yeah, and now forums are dead
this makes me think of tumblr in a sense
oh god, that would be worth switching for alone
corporate takeover of popular internet spaces makes me feel hateful
hm
spiral, i think we'd both have to take a peek into it to see what mastodon is actually like
i'm getting a weird mix of vibes
well, the problem is that forum formats aren't viable anymore
the social media genie is out of the bottle, so to speak
it's practically impossible to return to a forum format by dint of the fact that no one uses forums anymore, at least not with any serious level of participation
i'd be interested to see those numbers
i've been a part of numerous forums over the years, and since about 2012 or so
all of them have been completely dead
i don't doubt that there are some out there that are decently active, but it's complicated to figure out
would depend on the ratio of active to inactive users, rate of activity, stuff like that
wait, you said this is about an author?
hm
that actually gives me a frame of reference to work with
if you can find a way to obtain the information, average posts per day and new users gained would both be revealing
we could compare it with the rate of discussion in, say, the brandon sanderson subreddit
or something dedicated to his works
i have to admit, i miss the way that forums compartmentalized stuff
yeah, that's fair
i think me asking for stats is nitpicking
i still think that my statement holds _generally_ though
i don't think it's a coincidence that most of the forums i was using ended up dying when facebook and reddit started gaining mass popularity
and especially twitter, yees
i'm glad you've got something like that
the main forum i used when i was younger have all migrated to discord
which is 10 billion times better a result than what it was for like six years
which was "no one knew where anyone else was"
now a solid 50-75 people from the forums are on the discord server and we talk somewhat frequently
a pretty nice reunion
that reminds me, my sydlexia retrospective is literally the second result on google after theactual website itself when you google it
yes cy
oh, nevermind
the winds of google trends do not blow favorably this day
forums were great for more casual internet usage
now we're all addicted to our compooper machines
what does that mean cy
"is a spook"
help mother i can not click the book
i see
i don't know, with reference to this conversation i would associate "instant gratification" with the advent of the Big Three websites
which i would just call a paradigm shift
reddit twitter facebook
discord is still not really there, and i'm not sure it'll ever get there
its theming is too specific
yes, that especially
for all the talk of reddit being the front page of the internet, facebook is way more deserving of that title in terms of the number of people who use it
i'll be playing halo 2
except not yet because it comes out at 11 PM EST for some god forsaken reason
not sure why they didn't just annoucne it for may 13th
but whatever
inexcusable folly
booooo
i need to start taking notes for SPAT again
we have really fun and interesting conversations in here at least once a day, and there are a lot of new faces lately
but i'm SHIT at keeping track of any of that now
it's fucking frustrating
no, i don't think that would work
yeah, but not for a while
it comes out at the end of the day here
so effectively the 13th
another time, perhaps
for now, i sleep
nephrons
very good, djreeb
bwee bwee
bweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<@!125433170047795200> if you want to check out my fleet carrier, i'm stationed at a water world in V2338 Orionis
it's a conspiracy, obviously


yeah, dero and i are chillin'
what's not to love

yeah, but the process up to where it fucked up is incredible
i wish you could see it from inside the cockpit but this is fine by my account
only takes me six to eight jumps to make it wherever it goes at max range
<@!403923168701448202> thanks, that's pretty interesting
by posts, are they including both the creation of forum posts and any responses to them?
I CLAPPED
I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW HER
don't make jokes like that
doesn't matter
it draws an insane amount of scrutiny to us that we don't deserve
behave yourselves
it's okay, just don't do it again
FOOTBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL
enjoy access to linky for a while
i've temporarily enabled the linky command here
after a while i'll disable it, or sooner if it gets abused too hard
so be gentle with it
you got THAT right
that's the future, right there
i'm probably not gonna play any of the fan games
my friend alexa is going to start playing the painful tonight though, streaming it for anyone who wants to watch
it's her first time playing
lords mobile...
<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
```Jimmy, 8, the youngest... clearly smarter than we give him credit for.```
wow
i knew there was a theory that jon punched suzie in the face but i didn't hear THAT
jesus fucking christ, i'm losing my mind
friend's gonna start streaming LISA the painful in 4 hours from now
BE THEEEEREEEEEERE if you care about that sort of thing
i vape
besides "i don't feel like it"?
that's where you're wrong
baseball is the most emotionally wrought sport of all

man, lots of deaths from the coronavirus
at least in the english societies
maybe it's a warning against speaking english
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
i agree with moonjail
it probably has to do with income more than anything
i guarantee you a lot of the people who are out despite quarantine are people desperate for money
OR
they are entitled white people who don't care
one or the other
yeah, well
karl is the everyman for a reason
he's not stupid and adventurous, he just does what works
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
tensei lives in a place where the middle class hasn't been shrinking, perhaps
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i have to admit, it does not sound like something i'd expect to hear out of tensei
i remember the last time we talked about that
i think my counterpoint was that money and class aren't equivalent, but they're often correlated
the more money you have, the more likely you have to have a better
by whatever metric that might be
trump as a working class rich guy....
he doesn't have the same sense of aesthetic as rednecks at all, unless you just mean they have similar levels of stupidity when it comes to that sort of thing
a redneck's idea of decoration is a mounted deer head
trump's idea of decoration is a gilded toilet
they're both horrible taste, but different ideals
sure, i guess
there's just something inherently weird to me about equivocating those ideas
like, at the end of the idea you have a point, but
i think that's what i meant about money and class being correlated
trump's sense of taste and level of knowledge are both on par with the working class
the difference is that he has money and influence
and that makes all the difference in the world
uh
trump doesn't want to think he's working class at all
that would mean that he's on the same level as The Poor People
a lot of trump's motivation is in trying to elevate himself above others
yeah, precisely
i don't know what nigel farage's whole deal is
but if making himself seem working class is it, then he and trump aren't similar at all
god, halo 2 comes out in like four and a half hours
i cannot wait
i haven't played halo 2 since i was in middle or high school
which is a damn shame because that's just shy of 3 for me in my favorite entries
```"Well? What are you waiting for?"

"I don't know, Halo 2 I guess."

"Me, too, kid."```
WHAT
was it earlier release for euros
well, until halo 2 comes out, i'm going to be sating some gears of war energy
how have you not heard of this nik
god dammit
forget it, i quit
deleting the server brb
aw man
i forgot how much i loved this grittiness
gears of war, how i have missed
what the fuck
did they nerf the grenades
for the windows version
why do you feel that is
because i couldn't begin to really assess why if i tried
i haven't played enough TPS
you know
one thing that always confused me about gears of war 1 was the inconsistent awareness of the world that people had
in the very first level you're getting rescued from prison, right
and you get airlifted out
right before that, they seem something moving underground
someone asks what it is and everyone on the helicopter is like "i have no idea"
but they really should have known what the fuck it was because it's a common as dirt enemy type
that happens a few times throughout the story, if i'm not mistaken
they must have had some weirdness going on with the writing, i don't know what else could explain it really
READ WHAT YOU WANT TO READ

absolutely not, i have no salad

it really do be like that sometime

i'm more fond of battle tendency to be honest
i think battle tendency is my favorite
there's something viscerally exciting about it

you know what i miss?
oh, i was scrolled up
nevermind
i'll just hide my head in shame
i'm done sifting dirt jack-o
don't you see my status
i am the Master of Dirt
dirt sifts itself
for _me_
my master's degree is, i think, in horticulture
it's fucking weird, i don't realaly know how that works
look, graduate school is fucking confusing and sucks
this is now recommended watching material https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VMKb2uWyCs

that's enough linky for one night
the oracle needs to rest
that's a rare one, i'll have to mark it off my list
<@!155401695138938881> <@!338881173268987904> i forget if reti was interested in this but my friend is beginning LISA if you're still up for it <https://www.twitch.tv/bollucks>
she had issues with her audio, took a while to fix
SAD
yeah
it's a 20GB download
we're doing it when the update drops this week i think
oh shit, sorry andrew
she didn't make it very far, so don't worry
jesus fucking christ
i forgot just how unfair halo 2 is on legendary
fuck this, heroic it is
also just write whatever you wanttttttttttttttttt
SILENCE
i need to think a long time what i'm gonna do with you
in the middle of the night...
there's no grab emote
or evil laugh
no, that's stupid
if a concept is absolutely dreadfully boring, then no matter how well it's executed, it's still going to suck
i don't know why this is a one or the other thing
you need a decent concept that is ALSO executed well
yeah i guess i kind of retract my statement
i'm fine with the idea that a bad concept is merely harder to execute well
but i think it's important not to understate just how difficult it is to do something like that
to be fair, the problem was not exactly with the fact that every item combination had a description
the issue was that the team wasn't big enough to handle that sort of work
and they should have prioritized their resources and goals better
that's the sort of thing that's delightful in a game where everything else is already fine tuned
no, i don't think that logic holds up
i'm going to use an example from halo 2
because i'm playing it right now
in halo 2 there are a couple of places that are nearly impossible to reach unless you know precisely how to pull it off, and they don't yield anything critical to the game or story
but the presence of those things add to the mystery and fun of it for players who like that sort of thing
you don't add easter eggs because of how many people might see it
kind of the opposite actually
and your point is basically what i said but phrased differently
the item combination thing would have been fine if everything else had been handled better AND they had more resources to implement it
aw, but i wanted to watch the matrix trilogy at some point
sometimes you just need to refresh your memory of awful things
it's how you continue to grow as a person
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
it doesn't "make a habit" of this you buffoon
it does that very rarely
you're making it sound worse than it really is
and to be fair, it is indeed really bad
but that in particular is pretty well explained
we really do need to watch these movies so i can beat your head in with how stupid you are
it's happening
we're making it hapen
neo is only garbage in the second and third movies
in the first movie he's a perfect hero character
that tears it, we are absolutely watching these movies
within the next month, if not sooner
you have angered me
<@!205026834205769748> you will perish first
i like the real life action scenes in 3 okay
the last fight is _laughably_ bad
i love it
fallen order is great
i really hope we get more like fallen order, and soon
they did a pretty good job
and it's beyond obvious they were angling for a sequel
they have the full cast now, they just need to DO SHIT WITH THEM
REEEEEEEEEEEE
but yeah, i'm gonna get the matrix series uploaded so your ungrateful asses can all watch them with me
i might be spinning my wheels but you can bet i'm going to spin those wheels fast enough to turn into a fucking black hole
also i mean, the main thing that sticks out in my head is
they picked up what's her witchy face on the darth maul planet
and then she was around for literally the last chapter of the story and that's it
feels like kind of a waste if that's all she's around for
well that's hardly enough now is it
<:ree:475542526791516170>
look, i'm known to be a fan of the goth gf aesthetic
but trilla had like this
really unpleasant aspect to her character

nice gentle shade of violet

softy at heart
basically _perfect_ waifu bait
holy fucking crap
i'm ashamed at how hard that made me laugh
yeah, cal ain't much to look at, but that's more than fine
he's a good protag

IT SUBVERTS YOUR EXPECTATIONS SO IT'S GOOD
the point that's being made here is that subversion by itself doesn't make a work good or bad
the way in which the work is being subverted needs to be substantial or interesting, otherwise it's just annoying
oh god, heathens everywhere
NO
you shut the fuck up right now
rogue one is fucking terrible
god mines, you're physically hurting me
this is just awful
i might need to demod you for this
it's like you're specifically trying to push all of my anger buttons
what did i do to you
<a:pensiveWobble:530000479401279490>
"fertilizer is primarily waste products"
you're thinking of compost
fertilizer can be inorganic in nature, the product of manufactory
like really high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate
not stuff you'd find in nature, certainly not as a waste product
biosolids are primarily made of carbon
you fucking ingrate
also they like nitrates because they require them in order to make certain compounds that are necessary to survive
same with other nutrients
nitrogen is used in a LOT of compounds
there's like a ranked hierarchy of which elements are needed the most
typically nitrogen is the most rate limiting nutrient in plants
followed by phosphorous
and then it gets murkier from there
that's coolio
yeah, growing plants from scraps of leftover plants is common enough
i cut one of the leaves of my sundew into one inch fragments and they started developing plantlets a few weeks ago
no, it's just not in a form that's easy to work with
nitrogen in the air is typically N2
pretty stable
not easily able to be converted into workable form
some species of bacteria are good at it, and legumes form symbiotic relationships with those bacteria most of the time
which is why soybean is said to be nitrogen fixing
the soybean itself doesn't convert the nitrogen into a usable form, it's the bacteria that they symbiotically work with
air can diffuse into the dirt
dirt isn't packed so tight that stuff can't get through it
how do you think water exists
idiot
baka
you know what we call completely solid dirt
rocks
not a cute big tiddy goth gf
disregarded
we should watch eight legged freaks
that movie gave me nightmares as a kid
i'm still frightened of the idea of giant trap door spiders
that's much better
that book made me fucking cry
okay that's cursed
slow your roll kiddo
don't encourage this cy
do you think people ever got hot and bothered over those old woodcuttings or paintings
shut the fuc kup
i really hate brap jokes
i hate them with a fucking passion
i might start banning people for them
stop making brap jokes or else your life is forfeit
<:howSmush:359301099758551053>
i keep forgetting about that
what a delightful bit of knowledge
read what you want to read
believe what you want to believe
but go to bed every night
i'm pretty sure stores have multiple deliveries scheduled months out because of the way supplying works
actually now that i think about it, i'm not sure about that
because if i remember back to working at mcdonalds, they took inventory literally every day
so i imagine they were ordering food to match what was in our stocks
quick what's a cartoon we've been talking about that i said need to watch properly
i'm finally tired of spinning my wheels, slightly
i have literally no idea what wakfu is
i'm checking it out now
oh dear
oh no, you're right
i recognize these characters
that's not a good sign
hm
i actually have not watched all of courage the cowardly dog
my parents hated the show when i was a kid
and i just never picked it up later
terrible nonsense
why does wakfu consistently have the animation quality of one of those fake game commercials
BY ANODROUGH
what in the fuck
yeah, i'm afraid i gave up on wakfu already
THE SEARCH... . COCTINUES
we watched the movies together
i have to admit, they weren't all that compelling
fuck you tensei i do what i WANT
and then promptly regret it
i mean, i'm not saying that it's bad
it's just probably not for me, or at least not in the mindset i'm in right now
no, don't
you guys have been `posting rats` for days now
we need a serious topic

wow you people aren't really jumping on linky as much as i thought you would
maybe i misjudged all of you

i was going to add another joke to that but i've got nothing
<@!184545248930693120> you are a wiener
everyone shame cy when i unfreeze
or else banne

say goodbye to altgen
altgen is specifically for shitposting and to act like a dumb idiot
people trying to use it for genuine purposes is dumb
doesn't matter
i deleted the channel
all of the shitposting now goes in here too
okay, okay
i'm joking
let me bring it back, no shitposting in gen
ALL OF THE SHITPOSTERS GO BACK TO <#187028510848712704>
i warned you about altgen bro
anyway, dropping all jokes
<@!710275599695872081> what's the problem
it's no problem, i'm just here to help
shout at me if you need anything
i mean, kind of
i'm officially done here in like two weeks
depends on what you mean
it's a pretty up to date facility
what? no
virginia tech isn't an ivy league school but it's still kind of prestigious
it's pretty commonly known in the US
mind you that i'm a country bumpkin from the midwest so i don't know these things
but i'm fairly certain VT is a cut above UVA
i banned 'em
i don't want to deal with that kind of shit
what an asshole
i need to hang out in gen more and wreck ass
no brapposting, ever
NO
NO BRAPPOSTING
on pain of death
anyway, i dip my toes in here every once in a while
it's usually more pleasant than that
but if someone in here is being a cock, i'm going to get rid of them
probably not, i don't enjoy TF2
sorry
they might have been young but they were openly being a dickhead
kids deserve mercy, but only if they're not actively being a menace
i used to be a dumbass when i was younger but i was never malicious or angry about it
it was the result of bad social skills and general ineptitude
that sort of thing can be fixed without much issue
people being antagonistic dicks is much harder to deal with, and it's arguably no one's responsibility to handle it
lurking is half the equation, sort of how knowing is half the battle
it's good to lurk so you can know hwat's going on, but there's always that element of socialization as a skill
sometimes you need to participate to learn more
people mess up and that's fine as long as they're open to being crticized and fixing their mistakes
yes, definitely mint
i'm graduating
you fucking wiener
i passed my master's defense on monday morning
all i have to do is fix my thesis and resubmit it, then i can go home
usual shittery
it was fun enough but now it's over
deservedly so
or are they still going
bah, who cares
no, not really
i'm not really a traditionalist sort of person
i celebrate by relaxing
if there's anything i'll specifically do other than that, it'll probably be getting bbq or some local chinese food when i get home
i'm a fatty, i like food
carlarc you have an incredible way with words sometimes
oh i was scrolled up
oh i wasn't scrolled up that far
also yeah, that awkwardness sticks around until uh
well, not too long
actually i don't know
i'm trying to consider what i find awkward about juniper's character
the answer is "a lot of it" at first
oh yeah, that
thankfully wales improves how he handles those emotional asides as the story goes along
they still exist but they're not so blunt
if i'm analyzing it in a very generous way, it's almost like the quality of those passages improves as juniper's perspective changes and he grows more mature
but the reality of it is more than likely that wales just didn't know how to do it right at first
i'm interested to see what you think once you get out of the risen lands, the beginning of the book is so dull
god DAMMIT
I BIT HARD ON MY TONGUE TWICE IN A ROW

redemption arc
i love ultimate and it's definitely a step in the right direction, but it still just doesn't hit quite as fast or hard as melee
i know i'm a whiner for saying that, but it's true
Let the music play. It's what he'd want.
congrats
i've fallen out of my diet pretty firmly, which is a shame
but that having been said, i don't think i've actually gained that much weight
i managed to drop down to 280 and when i checked tonight i'm only at 285, maybe a bit less
i think i've gotten my indulgences out of my system for the foreseeable future too, so i don't know
why wiener citadel
what is wiener citadel
am i dead
drew linky
akshually
me too, linkybot
me too
i think i can feel spat energy returning to me
there is like
some semblance of motivation
i do think i'm going to reorganize it
so that "SPAT 1" is everything from the start of the journal up to makin stepping down
and then after that is the beginning of SPAT 2
that sounds so fucking stupid when i say it out loud, but it feels thematically appropriate too
the word "makky" is profoundly cursed, never utter it again
five pages down in one night
and the motivation to reorganize tomorrow
this is wonderful
i haven't felt this engaged in a while
i'm back baybee <:ree:475542526791516170>
(hopefully)
WHOAOAH
nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic
this is quality entertainment
gnawms is a glass half full kind of guy i see
and now this
holy shit
geoffrey barking like a dog got me good
also i haven't seen it yet so it's appreciated
i don't know why but this made me inordinately happy
good shit
yes
i can't wait personally
i have to admit
halo 2's legendary mode is just mind bogglingly difficult, to the point that i quit on the first try
i was kind of hoping that they would fix it but i can't handle that horse shit
dude i just said i quit
i had totally forgotten the extent of hits horibleness
i'm just doing heroic now
which, i agree with you
easy and hard at different times
i'm largely waiting to play until dero gets ready
but i beat cairo and you know what
i did the thing i always did when i was originally playing halo 2 so many years ago, which is get out of the map boundaries and explore
i almost didn't want to describe it like that, but
on cairo station when you're in space, there's a place where you can get up on platforms and there is CLEARLY an invisible barrier that pushes you back
but you can ewalk around it with literally no problem
i have no idea what the halo 2 devs were thinking but it's completely trivial to get around barriers like that in most of halo 2, and i fucking love it
exploring outside of map boundaries is probably one of my top favorite things to do in video games
i think spartan 1s were just Drugs
spartan 2s were the real big deal because all of the candidates were taken as young children and then had it mercilessly beaten into them that they're weapons of war and destruction
i think in johnson's case it's not quite so bad
but in general i agree
i hate the greater emphasis on master chief as the series goes on, he practically becomes a messianic figure instead of just a guy who was in the right place at the right time to get things done
but i think it's hard to treat a character like that seriously if they NEVER start to shoulder the weight of their actions
master chief didn't just become important as a retcon, he's a spartan 2 (whatever) and then destroyed a halo ring and an entire covenant armada
i can totally understand undergoing some hero worship for that
but then the reclaimer/library stuff later is
really really bad
fuck yeah
that reminds me i have a free burrito from chipotle i can get
i should do that before we watch chitti 2.0
i wonder if i can get it done in the next 20 minutes
isn't it time to start movie
get fucked idiot
i might be a bit absent for the first ten to fifteen minutes, i need to handle something
please proceed though
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
we're still watching chitti now
we still have an hour actually
join if you want to see it
https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight
it was like an out of body experience, totally worth it
we need to watch more movies like this
they scratch an itch i never knew i had
THREE POINT OOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

i'm sold
well, we should at least give it some time
like, doing robot and 2.0 so close together was a gamble
it paid off wonderfully, but still
if we want to do anymore great bollywood movies, we should wait for a substantial amount of time
reorganizing spat is not taking anywhere the amount of time i expected
it's almost... too easy
oh yeah, speaking of
there's two entries you should look at and add commentary fo
get on it, lackey
yeah, they're in the draft file
i wrote them up yesterday after you had gone to bed
well then it can wait
i'm still reorganizing the site anyway
oh yeah, seriously
council of arches has many genuinely funny moments in it
it's really not that pressing but sure
small spat update https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/bookii2020.html#12M
we will educate people
_by force_
god
just thinking about that kid makes me grimace
there's something about it that just put such a horrible taste in my mouth
dark souls 3 is the best mechanically but suffers from having pretty uninteresting visuals and a rehashed story
i totally can though
you are a wiener
they are mouseover multi
get fucked idiot
anyway, spat has officially been reorganized
hopefully i'll be able to keep my interest up and justify that
you wish
time to see if this sangria sucks or not
you know, i remember reading about this and i'm pretty sure that garlic powder is actually more effective at imparting the flavor of whatever it's added to
as opposed to raw garlic
although i do prefer raw garlic for a lot of things
also has a chance to poison you if cooked incorrectly, doesn't it
who pinged me
gentle reminder that i can just check the logs to see who did, even if the message is deleted
we're gonna need a fucking RECKONING around here
how dare you speak to me
i did, it's not there anymore you fucking dead son of a bitch
which means the person who pinged me deleted it

IT'S NOT SHOWING UP IN MY PINGS SO DIE
i once dissected the brain and eyes of a goat*
*it was a sheep but close enough
it was definitively a sheep, but on a casual basis i consider those the same things more or less
they're both four legged animals that people in america don't typically eat
that's all it comes down to
i wonder how close sheep and goats are to each other actually
actually they _are_ pretty closely related
they're both considered bovine animals
get fucked misha
the suck my dick
cy is just fucking checked out at this point
can you make that guitar just a bit louder pleas
oh nevermind the voice works
this makes me want to listen to yellow trash bazooka
okay i've had enough of listening to rednecks propose to a trash panda
time to put on the soothing, dulcet tones of the gerogerigegege
for those who may be unaware: ||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5qwsSZ_98M|| NSFW cover art
i discovered yellow trash bazooka at the tender age of 14
even 11 years later it still manages to make me laugh a few times
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gerogerigegege> just look at some of these titles
"Tokyo Anal Dynamite" is apparently their most well-known album
`William Bennett Is My Dick`
i mean, this is purely an exercise in comedy to me, i'm not really into noise
but hell, i'll give anything at least one try
jesus fucking christ i forgot that it just keeps getting worse and worse as the EP goes on <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i wonder how many microphones they ruined recording this shit
okay moon, the trumpet going off got me good
what year was this made
because
stuff like this is profound to me
god damn
it makes me feel a little less alone to know that people have always been out there, making shit like this
they can be pretty good
there's a song by paul mccartney and the wings that does that
it's one of my favorite songs by them
too much interesting new music to listen to
gnawms, what does that remind me of
no you fucking troglodgyte
it reminded me of this, i just found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4yFvZZ1c8s
DON'T MIND IF I DO
<:punctuation:473648526220591114>
how's the anime for beastars anyway
is it any good
yeah, i haven't caught up on the manga in a while
last time i read was uh
||legosi and the bear fought each other and the bear got arrested||
i remember nothing after that
damn, i should catch up
that sangria wasn't bad
time for more
a lot of the compilations for vaporwave and chiptunes i listen to on youtube are apparently pulled together from soundcloud quite often
is there something about the website that makes it inherently easier to search for newer/less popular content
if you mention what's her nuts again
oh, okay
yeah but every time i say "chiptunes" you're like "LISTEN TO CHIPZEL"
like yeah bitch i know
she's great
fuck you
link me to that tera i don't think i've listened
you and your oscilloscopes and your atari chips
this is actually fun to watch though
ouch
it's great but the soundfont at 1:20 or so is spiking into my eardrums
this makes me want to listen to the castlevania 3 mashup where the guy combines the NES and FAMICOM versions
and it has the best components of each
stoopit uncle fill
oh, hm
this gets really fun with the alternative theme
i'm actually enjoying watching this
aw man, this is an excellent track
there's so much good electronic music out there
we truly live in a golden age
FUCK
this is true deep lore
let me pull this one out though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKS9fk1jhR8
music can indeed be pretty fucking sweet
it doesn't remind me of the beach though
makes me think of like a night sky
space cruising levels
horrible beyond comprehension
i could do some dramatic bible fic readings maybe
depends on if we find the right one
see, now that
that's fucking perfect from the title alone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwIQ3nBZ4Dw
i have tried to seek out similar mash-ups to this but almost none exist
if they do, this is probably the best one anyway
jesus fucking christ
what is going on with this video
it has an older youtube format
the comment section actually makes fucking sense

am i the only one seeing this
not the youtube night theme
you fucking ingrates
i mean the old youtube format
jesus christ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3iC3SgsZO0
last ninja 2 is a fucking banger
there's so much good chiptune music out there, god damn
too much to listen to in one night
i need more sangria
fuck you
great response tbh
oh no, the rainbow bunchie song
it's going to be stuck in my head
man, i wish
i'm waiting until they fix their netcode
great attempt at the concept, just needs some basic stuff worked out
god damn it, this famitracker rendition of An Underlying Problem is almost frustrating
there are no DPCM instruments, and in fact the ONLY instrument is probably the default setting
which means everything in this famitracker file is probably achieved through sound effects
it makes me feel like a chump
a CHUMP
i know, i'm just saying that this is what mastery of famitracker looks like
i guess it helps that the dude has a track to go off of already
my frustration comes from unfamiliarity with the techniques available AND the fact that i can't write music for shit
rez cracktro 4 is a fucking banger though

<@!205026834205769748> you're famous
wait, so are those orange things like gasoline containers or what
i'm still not as familiar with the game as i'd like
ah, alright
sounds useful
dero and i are just going around in halo 2 and exploring the boundaries of the map, i'll be streaming it casually if anyone wants to watch
just click on my name, die, etc
die
that was really fun though
i missed halo 2
yeah
it's pretty good
i was being a bit too loud for this time of night but no regrets, that was fun
also that was me powering the submarine up for the first time, it was cool
if you don't think that's the coolest shit then get the fuck outta my face
_UFO noise intensifies_
```idorts in 2009```
seeing "idort" in a context other than misha in the last year is really bizarre to be honest
the fact it goes back so far is really interesting
it's weird to think of all of the online content and discussions that just get completely forgotten
here's a subset of internet culture that's pretty obscure and niche
and only a handful of people will ever know it even exists, let alone participate in it
i wonder just how many instances of that exist on the internet
hundreds of thousands to millions
uh
okay, discord is working

okay, i don't know what the fucking deal was
anyway, it is enshrined forever
hey
i can't say i have please for to explain
we've hit a new low
what the fuck is lit smoking today
how much money
it's okay, makin gave me the answer i wanted
the world has settled back on its proper axis
also eloze is long but i don't think it's as long as wtc
let me check
yeah, it's a bit under half the length of wtc
combination of things
i was going to explain more you fucking ingrate
anyway
the explamatioj is right here

bitthch
anyway
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
misha, you should never ever be hired to write plot synopses
we got DERAILED
honestly i feel self-conscious because i know the fic isn't actually that great
but nah, it's kind of ambitious for the time when it was started
the placement of games in zelda's timeline was always really stupid and hotly debated back before the hyrule historia was released
thanks anouma
but anyway, eloze was started back right after ocarina of time came out, and so there was five games and a crappy comic book/tv show
none of those things occupied the same space really, except for perhaps the first and second games
the overall point is that there are a lot of weird inconsistencies concerning every individual piece of zelda media, and so eloze was an attempt to bridge the gaps and turn it all into one cohesive narrative
and if that were all it was then it wouldn't be very good still, because there were four hundred million of those fics even back in 1998
but the author did a pretty good job of spinning a new, conclusive narrative out of all the pieces available
no
okay ocean anakin
what are wales' other works again
i bet that fic actually exists somewhere tensei

what other sequels can we look forward to jay
i think this may genuinely be RLM's best "side" content https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YFyu9aAZow

i will KILL
I'M HERE TO SHOW THE WORLD
i'm just watching my friend play LISA
she got to the part with OOHUGH
OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH OOOHUGH
she's pretty unflappable so basically none
she just got done with henry wyatt
no hesitation
i feel kind of annoyed because i managed to be unnerved with basically all of that stuff
she's just wierd so whatever
misha, after playing through a bit more of halo 2 again, i have to identify it and maybe 3 as this sweetspot in halo lore where master chief and johnson were both distinguished but weren't designated as Holy Warriors
like, they didnt have anything overtly special about them, they were just really good at what they did
master chief more so for obvious reasons
i just wish we could go back to that tone
fuck this chosen one bullshit
leave that to the fantasy genre
sure, i can agree with that
<:PepeHands:463366205210886144>

i've been more or less celebrating all week
i did record my defense, but it has my real name in it, so i didn't share it her
if anyone is interested in looking at it for some god forsaken reason, i can edit it to cut out any real names
but otherwise, it was gucci
all i've got left is to adjust my thesis according to what my committee wants and then i'm officially done
it feels weird to put the last three years of my life behind me

`i know how tough it is somedays, to look with hope and confidence on the months and years ahead, but i would like to tell you what i often told you when you were much younger: i like you just the way you are`

i have nothing to add to that, it's just a fun name to say
GARGAMEEEEEL
why
that's weird but alright
i literally hosted two previous terraria servers, has that changed a lot recently
can't tell for sure but it looks like that hand might have some hydrophobicity to it
hm
doesn't have a medium listed but someone in the comments is saying it's probably oil
poop ballsack the brown
also i'll take a look moon
wait, so
what is this about precisely
i can't see how this could possibly go wrong
i'm just thinking about how this would work logistically
so he's inducing his stomach cells to produce lactase right
anyway i'm not an expert in this shit
this easily seems like a microbiological hackjob to me but it's not my specialty
there are limits to what you can feasibly accomplish with gene therapy
inducing intestinal cells to produce lactase is one thing, because you're just causing one type of cell to secrete one kind of enzyme
which while still kind of hacky is not unheard of by any means, all horizontal gene transfer involves this kind of thing
but let's say you want to do something really fucking weird, and transfer the gene or genes that allow spiders to make silk
what the fuck does that actually entail
it's not just a matter of giving the cells the ability to manufacture the material, it's also about giving them the mechanical means of production
silence, wench
yeah, i was really frustrated with it until i found someone who was specifically willing to guide me through the process without blasting ahead full steam
once you understand the premise and become familiar enough with all of the materials/mechanics, it's really fun
it's just that there's a lot of content to get used to
no, i have no ethical dilemma with gene therapy or modification
i'm not some kind of luddite
i just cast doubts on the efficacy of the process in a lot of respects
CRISPR and other methods of gene insertion are not magical
i have no idea what you're talking about, so i assume it was a meme
typically this stuff spreads really fast through the scientific community if it's actually a serious result
if it's not, then no one gives a shit
bah
terraria follows the minecraft principle of "gather materials and improve toolset" well enoguh, it's just that there are more materials to work with
minecraft has wood, stone, iron, and diamond
terraria has wood/everything else, other metals, iron, then it gets into weird shit
i don't remember it well enoguh, i've only played terraria a few times
actually i heavily abuse a guide whenever i play, i forgot about that
something that tells you about basic progression you should be following
just use that and you should be fine
i STILL don't really understand the coolwhip skit
like, sure, it sounds funny
i guess it just doesn't make any sense to me
does the fact that stewie is "eating hair" change the way he says the word
i just don't understand
that's seth mcfarlane for you
i'm going on a hike right now
the answer to your question is probably "no," as fun as it'll be, making a terraria server hasn't been the forefront priority for me
we're just talking about making a server that i'll be hosting when my computer is on, right
i don't see what the trepidation is about
you want a dedicated, permanently on server??
i can do that too
i'll have to work through it a bit, i've done it for minecraft but not terraria
nah, i want people to have fun without any expense on their part
i'll just need help finding a good hosting service probably
it's whatever works, i don't mind either way
as it is, i'll be back in a couple hours
assuming i don't fall off the mountainside or anything
ree ree, etc
doesn't the update come out in 3 hours
god damn it
i was going to say, you guys would probably be better off figuring this out yourselves then
especially since i'm less knowledgeable about it
no need to make things more complicated by having me figure them out last minute
silence, husky
the one with the actual fat dog in his profile picture
not husky the user
you know what actually
i think i'll be back sooner than i mentioned
i have been very inactive these last several weeks and i'm probably not up to getting to the top of the mountain
i'll just do half the hike and come back in an hour or so
we'll figure shit out then
perish
can't hear you going outside to hike now lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
did someone ping me
i did, whatever ping i got isn't there
i assume it was deleted
<a:shaggy:423637406231560192>
i'm working on getting terraria hosting
no, i was going to set up a 24/7 server for a month
it's not that expensive
maybe i shouldn't be handling this actually, i'm used to working with a minecraft server host but not terraria
is it much different
you know, i think what i can do is just
host it on my own machine and then port it over to a hosting service later
once i find one that verifiably works
is 32 GB of RAM enough
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i know you dumbass
it's the "24/7" part that i'm more imminently concerned with
it's more complicated with minecraft because my current ISP literally won't allow me to host a server on my machine directly, terraria works just fine though
the inconvenience is that i have to keep my computer on and the game running whenever people want to play on it
i'll figure it out later
i used to not do that but it shortened the lifespan of my electronics
unless you're just joking
in which case fuck you
gerg no happy with wasting resources
gerg say be environmentally conscientious
<:squinting:538174601146925066> you guys do realize that PC parts undergo wear and tear just like any other piece of equipment right
if you keep a laptop running 24/7 it will verifiably wear out faster than a laptop that you turn off every night
just waiting for the update button to show up
the update button is not showing up
let me refresh steam
there we go
okay, just making doubly sure
how do i make it a master world
i have journey, classic, mediumcore, hardcore
ah, okay
we're doing crimson, we already contemplated this

all good?
generating the world
alright, server is up
password bepis
how do i find the server ip, the options i see are "invite only" and "friends"
ree ree
someone test and see if this is the IP needed
here makin, i'll DM you
yeah
we're working on it
something's not right here
yeah, one moment
oh, this is interesting
okay, i started the server from the .bat file
going to see if i can join on local ip
oh that was exciting
i love computers sometimes
start fresh you fucks
OKAAAAAAAY
it's hosted with friends can join
password bepis
yep, there we go
aaa
friends of friends can also join
does terraria have player limits
16, right
yes
you'll have to join through steam, i'm not experienced with terraria servers
that's the only way i was able to make it work
what's your steam name
you have to join through friends
send me a friend request on steam and i'll accept it
then you can right click my name and join game
we're caught in the throes of this game
d
yes ifnar, plenty of people
heartbreak in the terraria server
friend me on steam
<@!388032299524030474> <@!147836475071791105> friended btw
then just right click my name and join game
<@!147836475071791105> <@!388032299524030474> <@!432301854609768458> <@!193814482420498432> password is bepis btw
i think my internet is straining under all the users i have on right now
experiencing weird block issues
aaaaaa
this is why i want a designated server host, would help with this issue
so far this is the crowning achievement of the server
haha eye of cthulhu go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
yes
the lag is just unacceptable, i'm porting the server over to a professional hosting server
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
fuck the ghosts, god damn
WOOD
i'm not carrying all of this WOOD
i have no idea what else it could be
my computer is still pretty much top of the line
that's the primary problem, is the internet
it's not god
i'm just trying to figure out details for this hosting service
how many people did we have playing at one time today
i'll put it at 20 just to be safe
just in case we get a surge next time we play
we're probably only going to be doing this for one month anyway
before i commit to this service, does anyone know of any solid hosting services already or
it's going to be in a bit misha
i was hosting directly on my computer but the lag was insufferable
i'm purchasing professional host just now
ugh
all of the hosting services jacked their prices up today, typical
yeah these fuckers literally doubled their price per slot after the update went out
bah
it's not anywhere close to 100 dollars, it's just 24 for the month
it's twice as much as i pay for the minecraft hosting each month
what kind of hosting services are you purchasing that cost 100 bucks a month
it's not me, it's the hosting service
they're still verifying my payment
which is honestly not a good sign
it's not my fault <:reeeeee:565673927460913182>
it's possible that the site is being overloaded by new requests for hosting, i don't know
the one i found is called "GTX Gaming," if someone wants to suggest an alternative i'm all ears
i have 24 hours to refund this service with no penalty
i can't make this service go any faster, until it makes the server available we're basically fucked
up until now we've been using my computer, yes
and my internet just can't handle all the people
yes makin, which is why i'm confused that the server status is still pending
starting to get annoyed
shut thE FUCK UP
i'm trying a different service, i can just request a refund if it goes through on this other one first
this other service worked
i'm porting the server over now
god DAMN IT
my dad called me and he wants to talk about the coronavirus going through his church congregation
<:reeeeee:565673927460913182>
i am not fucking familiar with the terraria config files
i'm trying to figure this out on the fly
ree ree, etc
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
i'm uploading the world files to the server now
i think once i hit start and find the IP, it should be good to go
okay, i managed to get the server up and running, but it's not using the world file
give me a minute
nope, it's not working
keeps creating a new world file even
you guys are just going to have to be fucking patient
makin do you want the login info so you can figure this out yourself?
because i'm starting to actually get pissed off
people were complaining about crystal hearts, might be worth making a new world, but let's try and salvage what we have already
no
god damn it
let me post the info
yeah alright
just send me A DM if you still need the info
i don't remember hearing about it ending like a dumpster fire, if nothing else

yes
yes
i have the IP address and port, just ask and i'll DM
if you could look it up i'd be grateful, i'm really fucking tired and had enough trouble just getting it set up that makin had to step in
sigh
oh there's an entire button for steam update
once this blood moon is over i'm kicking everyone and updating it
yes
you're going to have to fucking wait
<a:seething:523288464473718814>
alright, starting the server back up
yep, it's back up
for fuck's sake
like wrangling a herd of cats
yes there's an update
good time to stop tbh, friend is getting ready to finish lisa tonight probably <@!648719525357027328> <@!155401695138938881> <@!111477124384202752>
üêÆ
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
yeah of course i put it back
i'm not a dick who leaves my cart out in the middle of the parking lot
it's an inconvenience to others, altruism is important
OOHOOGH
<@!155401695138938881> <@!111477124384202752> the fuck are you guys
you missed the entire--oh
i didn't realize i was in altgen
WHOOPS
mines, andrew, you both missed the ENTIRE EWC
how dare you have a life
it's the eternal world championship
ree
i wonder if that actually played a part in this guy's calculus
if so, that is fucking impressively sickening
i wonder what the grand outcome of this will be in america
even in other places like some countries in europe, it doesn't feel like people are really taking this seriously
my dad called me today and said that he might have contracted coronavirus and that likely everyone in my family over there has had it
i'm moving back in with them at the end of the month, so if that's true then i'll undoubtedly have it too
i wonder if this is the sort of situation that other people go through or if it's caused more by that general cultural idiocy of going out in public spaces without regard for social distancing or masks
fuck you tori
the üëå was literally the first thing i saw when i tabbed in
you've ruined my night
oh no, don't take over my job i don't really want
how horrible
pet theory for WTC: ||tom from joon's D&D group on earth is the dungeon master||
thanks tori
i can always count on you
do you ever feel ashamed for the things you say to people
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
christ, what did i miss
nice
i'll be on later, got some stuff to take care of
<:Smug90sAnimeVillain:525965957600903179>
<:ree:475542526791516170>
i mean, there's nothing stopping us from making one still
i don't see what use we'd get out of it though, aside from boss fights
and it's just not going to be feasible to have everyone in on those at the same time
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
<@!120187484863856640> not much we can do about that unfortunately
unless we want to add that mod someone mentioned yesterday
what
<@!542086093776879616> are you the one bringing in advanced shit to the terraria server
if so, knock it off
ah
my bad
then yes <@!542086093776879616> we might need your help with that mod, i don't know shit about modding terraria
also misha do classic mode
hm
slave to my `master mode is hard`
i'm just going to take the night and grind hellstone stuff
you had enough hellstone for a full set of equipment after ten minutes?
literally how
unless the answer is obsidian skin pots
yeah whatever then
i'm doing it THE HARD AND STUPID WAY
ie neither of those things
i'll check it out, because i'm over halfway done grinding a full set out, but i wanted to make extra for people who might be lagging behind
carlarc
how many times do i need to say it before you get it through your thick monkey cranium
i don't play this game that often
i'm probably overtly aware of less than 20% of it
google: how do you ban people from your terraria server
fuck is rodina
lmao
just got stats for today
lit is dead thanks to terraria
good shit
i was using a golden bow and fire arrows
yes, laugh
laugh at me
do it, i demand it
i think i'm actually decently kitted now
hellstone armor, sword, molten picks (plus two extra in the community chests)
minishark with over 4000 ammo
I FUCKING LOVE WARHAMMER
yes, i'm good with that trade
i'd need to grind a bit more hellstone to make another set of armor and items though
what exactly do you want
<@!167020115143950336> in that case i feel obligated to tell you that aglets are very valuable as loot
i'm still willing to craft you a full set of hellstone equipment in exchange for it but in the longterm you might want to keep it
it can be combined with other accessories and their effects will merge, so they don't take up as many accessory slots
yes, lightning boots are the main deal i'm told
they're valuable enough that tm was contemplating fishing for hours to get one
also yes, i'll echo the sentiment that we're actually not that far in yet
as long as you have decent stuff you can still kind of tell what's happening
it's after hardmode begins that you're basically fucked
yeah, i know how you feel
i've made it up to moonlord before but i play extremely infrequently, so it took a few hours before i properly got back into the mindset
yes, i think there is
let me try and find the one i used
the wiki honestly has a decent collection
here's a massive list of guides https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki:Projects/Guides
here's a progression guide specifically <https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Game_progression>
and associated graph
<https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Game_Progression_graph>
thanks misha
i'm just tipsy enough to appreciate it
<@!168980988477702145> this is quality content, thank you
also my brain is mush after playing terraria for so long today
<@!125433170047795200> "Oh, I'm sorry, were you sitting he--"
`YES SIR.`
i don't usually share shit from twitter but this is killing me https://twitter.com/sandybatchelor/status/1262038309456547840
doesn't the merchant live outside of the main block of houses
like on the left of the big hill
oh, sorry
i think so, yes
unless spiders can spawn outside of their biome, in which case no idea
but i encountered a nest somewhere under our house
ree ree
is there anything even left before hardmode
i guess we haven't killed queen bee yet
indeed
people have been looking forward to this terraria thing for a long time
i don't know why the number is so high here but a significant number of people here are incredibly fond of the game
regular streams could honestly use a break anyway
so don't worry about it until terraria's flavor of the month status falls off
wait, you're the creator of kgtac?
delightful
welcome to your fan club
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
when are we all gathering to fight queen bee and WOF
despite not being into this game myself very much, i greatly enjoy it when we get a lot of people on at the same time
a sacred contract
sometimes it feels like people are speaking a different language when they talk about this agme
that's always what happens with flavor of the month games
we never expect to play them for, as the term implies, a month
space station 413, SCP, minecraft
we're pretty well used to this phenomenon at this point
the thing that gets me about it is that like
in a sense, i understand where she's coming from, and to some extent i even think i agree
i don't think that the system we've got now helps people as much as it should, and it's definitely not sustainable
but the stuff she advocates is moronic
and i don't mean that in the sense that it's morally repugnant, althoguh some of it is
but if she really wanted to incite or inspire change, there are way, WAY more effective ways to do it
i spent an afternoon thinking of strategies and ideas that could be used to spread that sort of logic and rhetoric and avoid minimal harm/blowback
so far as i can tell she doesn't give a shit about any of that kind of stuff, strategy does not play a part in what she's doing
she's just vomiting her spleen up on twitter for people to see, and at this point i'm not sure what her actual goal is with doing so
like, if she's trying to inspire other people to follow in her footsteps, she is failing horrifically
if she's just trying to get attention then she's being a little more successful there, even if just by dint of us talking about it
it improved america for white people
everyone else got the shaft
which part
oh yeah, i don't think that's realy logical
communism in its historical forms is probably not the way to address the issue, but just letting capitalism continue unabated is clearly not working
the united states and to some degree the entire world is slipping into a state of dysfunction
well, who cares
those people are fucking morons
that's not a surprise to anyone with half a brainstem
no, not really
i mean, yes, in the sense that they can be said to be part of this larger overall group
but movements aren't monolithic
any real force for change will have to come from a unification, even if just temporary, of people who usually would disagree with each other for small reasons but decided to come together to fight a common enemy
if crony capitalism is beaten back, it'll undoubtedly be because of such an arrangement
T H E     U N W A S H E D      M A S S E S
i don't think anyone wants to return to a system of governance and society where we were merely "surviving"
working on that definition, i think the chances of humanity going truly extinct is slim to none, barring something outrageously catastrophic
a lot of these statements sound kind of platitudinous and i'm not sure how much i appreciate it
no, i was saying that they sound like smart things to say but they're actually kind of vapid or useless
sure misha, that sounds more reasonable to me for some reason than what was being said before
i don't know, my brain is kind of fried
i guess the overall point to be taken away from all this is to never be fully satisfied with what we've got, because it can demonstrably be improved, but also to not exaggerate how bad we might have it now
I LOVE THE REPUBLIC
i'm gonna give myself a haircut and then i'll be back on the server
i want that fucking hardcore ore
yeah, we beat WOF
eater of worlds?
<@!111477124384202752> stop asking me that, i will never ever provide pictures of my haircuts
ree ree, etc
i have longer hair than most stereotypical dudes around here
or i did
now it's definitely not a lot
uh
that's an oddly specific detail
maybe i described it that way back then but now i'm not sure how i'd describe it
it's not something i think about a lot
nah, it's fine
i was more puzzled why i would say something like that
you do say things that i would consider creepy sometimes, but i never think you do it out of malice or intentional weirdness or anything like that
we've been over this a number of times, you're just socially rarted
we'll beat that out of you eventually
this place is a meatgrinder, and our ground beef is the finest social malfeasants you could possibly imagine
the overall point is that i'm not worried about you, really
you're fine as long as you keep listening when people offer you feedback
that's all anyone can really ask
‚ò†Ô∏è
i want to hop back into terraria but i've got fries in the oven
TRULY A LIFE OF HARDSHIP AND STRIFE
nah i'll just read a chapter or two of wtc
you'll get fries in two to three business days will that be cash or credit

sorry, we only accept etherium
my eternal servitude
fuck
tensei's not going to be happy if we beat it i think
something about the eternia crystal and its difficulty
OH FUCK
i got super fucking angry at terraria and people playing it for being impatient and going full steam ahead when not everyone was ready
<@!205026834205769748> <@!273994148825268224> sorry for yelling at you guys
<@!273994148825268224> what exactly should i be prioritizing with adamantite
drill? because the pickaxe axe seems imminently more useful and it's obtained by beating mechanobosses only
ah, the wiki says armor and weapons, nevermind
since mythril mines the same stuff
nah, there's a real progression to it
cobalt < mythril < adamantite
<@!298516367311765505> you were trying to grind dark shards, right
do blood mummies count as dark mummies? if not, what the fuck's the deal
okay, good to know
i want the onyx shotgun
i got an adamantite helmet but i'm so tired of getting instagibbed by stuff in the deep underground
so i'm kitting myself with a good gun or SOMETHINg before i go back down
actually i might get the shotgun and then call it a night
i feel like that should increase my lethality at least a bit
maybe i should also get mythril chest and greaves to go with the adamantite helmet
i don't know, i'm tired of getting fucking creamed in fights
like, there's gotta be something i'm missing
fuuuuuuck i know, it just costs so much to get adamantite bars
5 ore per
it's fucking _murder_
uh
i know
it's default h
i do not, i have regular pots
do you know if we have any of those magic daggers
i actually really like those, makes it easy to grind enemies
they're magic items, you click on the screen and a dagger flies around with your cursor
and you can just indefinitely hold it up and fuck things up
ah, that's right
i forgot that they're actually pretty rare
<@!168980988477702145> yes i would
yeah, i'm really tired of looking through chests
eye of cthulhu, the twins, and the flying dutchman
ddfdsfsdafdsa
i see discussion about the latest update has already stopped
not very surprising given that basically nothing happened whatsoever
is that all it takes to be called an expert
MOONSHOES
to infinity and beyond
man, this is just sad
homestuck update and the most entertaining thing we can dredge up is linky bot
which to be fair, is very entertaining
rina is very gracefully setting up the background
we worked out the logistics and it's perfectly scaleable if we want to expand
before we're done for the night we'll have the mud blocks up and the ore growing
it's going to be mildly inefficient because we just put everything in the same spot but we will have our ore
oh yeah, definitely
i just saw the tweet about michael bay directing a coronavirus movie
what a fucked up world we live in
i mean, china is pretty infamous for ripping shit off, so i'm not surprised
answer
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
i don't know who that is
agree
reducing the message cooldown
anyway, shaddy on the sub said it best
this update made it seem very clear that there's no unified vision or heart to this story
so it comes across kind of dull and uninteresting
wait what
oh my god, what
that's... interesting
i guess we'll never hear about that because the team is infamously reclusive and hates to make any details of their inner workings known
so just another administrative development that will go unexplained forever
i am sad, that's all there is to be said about it
uh huh
yeet that phone, more like
cy, there was nothing in the update that i thought was innately bad
but following that, i don't really think that there was much in this update to begin with
nothing really happened
so i'm effectively checked out for this one
a hero we desperately need in these dark times
+progress
pretty solid
el hueso
it's weird to be excited to go to bed so that when i wake up i can play more terraria
guess i'll get to it
backlog was very entertainingt
i wish sleep wasn't a thing so i had been present for all of these conversations
anyway back to terraria like the slave i am
uih
am i the only one having connectivity issues
let me see what's up
it just stopped for some reason
there we go, it's back up
don't worry misha
our throes will be finished soon enough
i mean, how much more is there to do
it's plantera, golem, moon cultist, and moonlord right
moon pillars?
i want that DEATH CIRCLE STAFF
still prefer UFO staff though
i cannot count the number of times i've forgot i had the chat bar up so i'll just type ddddddddddddddddddddddd and be confused when my character isn't moving
`Salon.com has described the show as "Marxist."`
this fucking killed me for some reason
reeeeeeee
<@!165162590878695424> i think at this point you're the only person we're waiting on to start fighting bosses
if you're unavailable that's fine, just giving you a headsu p
<@!205026834205769748> you are ghey
i'll brb

i wonder what it would be like to experience life as a fluffy dog
mark that one in the furry column i guess
i'm pretty sure canines are among the mammals considered self-aware
even if on a limited basis
minecraft is basically terraria but way more limited in scope
also andrew that's only with specific kinds like pugs
they specifically suffer because their squat faces make it hard to breathe
https://gfycat.com/achingfaintape
what in the fuck are you people doing in here
stop being dumbasses
you heard linkybot, you all have 4 hours left to live
you have no chance, make your time
was it put in for this update specifically??
OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH
the EWC is life
i like how cavalier that question is despite what it portends
"ah, hello. tell me, by chance, would you happen to be the literal savior of our entire world?"
isn't it only 0.2-0.3%
gonzo tweet
yeah, this is pretty tame by those standards
it's still shitting the channel up though, i'll agree
please refrain unless it's specifically relevant
you fuck
it's because we're playing with people who are absurdly good/experienced with the game tipsy
we stand no chance unless we get significant downtime to play catchup
playing catchup is not fun, i'll agree with that
but i think that's compensated by playing with a large group of people and then the feeling of superiority when i finally HAVE caught up
processing one terahertz, memory one zettabyte
<@!207991389613457408> if you post that picture again i'm tempbanning you
anyway
can't even be mad
but seriously, no more chitti jokes
_for today_
they can come back tomorrow
ANYWAY
i've complained numerous times about makin/tensei/tmtm being impatient and starting boss fights when not everyone is ready
i don't know what the curve is for terraria but you guys are definitely way better than the rest of us
if you want everyone on a public server to have fun, you gotta make sure everyone is keeping up
when i play minecraft with someone who's inexperienced i don't just rush to the ender dragon as fast as humanly possible
i make sure that they know what's happening and what we need to do
it was an example you festering shit mime
you know you guys can just hang out and do stuff right
you don't need to participate in boss battles
although we can probably do boss stuff that's lower level and get you up to snuff
i'm down for hosting people who are less awre of what's happening
i care far less about this sort of thing because i only ever play terraria with other people
yeah, that's kind of what i mean when i say you guys are going fast tensei
that's fucking mindboggling to me
and i'm sure the same is true for most of the people playing
strictly speaking, you could figure out how to do all of that using in-game hints
but to be perfectly clear
they are not telegraphed very well
get me a chitti emote
and turn it into a troll, preferably
that's how it works carlarc
this is the age of who cares
you're first on the chopping block, don't worry
why the hell is it called the fortnite room, incidentally
<:howHigh:585576558916272142>
as much as i complain about the unforgiving pace you guys are _trying_ to set, i will say that many many times playing terraria together has been fucking fantastic
every time we fight a boss is great, just four billion bullets and magic spells hitting it all at the same time
that looks like a fucking nightmare
jesus fucking christ
wait, what game is this for
i have no idea what this is
i don't think i've ever heard of it
wait, fucking what
no actually
i have never seen this
i mean, i do now
good god, that made me laugh out loud
okay, that's enough
no more cum chalice jokes
pody
i mean... post
i have to admit, it's an interesting example of viewing things through a wide lens or a very narrow one
the greater good versus the personal
dream drive is not that bad, come on
no, a couple of individual chapters are smut
the large bulk of the story is distinctly not smut
don't exaggerate
i will agree that it's all around kind of rough
what the fuck do you want, the sex stuff in it is an examination of the concept from outside of a human perspective
it's as objective as it could get, probably
don't be such a prude, christ
My discord client is fucking expmodi g right now, help me
test
okay, laptop's good
desktop is still fucked
whatever, i'm making final revisions to my thesis anyway
too bad i missed actual lit conversation, very disappointing
is that """dr.""" phil
figures
it's fucking dumb makin
i have to make the draft and submit that for approval before they'll allow me to schedule my defense
then once my defense is over i have to address any changes tehy want me to make and then submit it again
i don't know why they do it this way, let me totally finish the thesis and then defend
fucking bureaucrats
DOT
oh shit i'm back
thank you discord gods
reti did you not see Robot with us
god, you missed out so hard
we watched that and the sequel
they were basically meme fountains
i still have server space rented out for it
i could set that up literally right now
find more people who are interested and i will
it's not fun with only 2 peeps
it's gotta be like a proper number of people, at least six
<@!195290352838508544> how's that emote coming along
oh shit that's great
i was thinking more along the lines of troll chitti, but that's pretty fun too
i wouldn't add it to here though
<:dot:712826472397537291>
`Owls now hoot less`
lmao
i even registered the owls hooting more but didn't realize people had been complaining
i'll update the server real fast
server updated, it's working as normal
quality work carl
did you make the horns yourself
listening to cassette blues, and it really do be like that sometimes
i think the response was overblown, although red didn't help
keeping positive luck and eliminating bad luck is the ideal way to move forward
kino is a fine term, people who vehemently oppose it are just contrarians
further, i am of the opinion that carthage must be destroyed
multivac you're being dumb
gnawms has a point
kino is a pretty hollow term by itself
but you're also right that idioms usually have some kind of intent of expression behind them
kino is just shorthand for "this film has artistic properties i like"
really, the problem isn't with the term, it's with brain dead monkeys who refuse to follow it up with a proper explanation
yeah, what barkley said
cy, i'm weirded out to hear you say this
like, look at the opposition
i'm not happy about it but trump's presidency is already a known factor, and it's fucking terrible
as opposed to... someone who is absurdly harmful to minorities and a sexual assault record that puts harvey weinstein to shame?
i was going to say
if we're going strictly on a numbers basis, your argument doesn't add up
as opposed to voting against trump, which is trivially easy to understand
yeah, but we don't have that now
again, i hate it too
i think it sucks we're in this position, and i wouldn't be surprised if trump wins a second term
but we already understand just how destructive he is
and i think it's completely correct to say that however shitty or destructive biden would be, he's not as destructive as trump is and would be
that's how simple the calculus is
well, what's your suggestion then
revolt?
get in line
i mean, that is essentially what's happening keep
i think the part they're focusing on is the pandemic part
well that's stupid reasoning
at least on the surface
if they're talking strictly in terms of the nebulous economy then that's ridiculous
but if they're speaking in terms of wealth disparity
then that's been a problem since far before this
let me condense this argument down
saying that we should probabilistically make things worse on purpose because things aren't going our way right now is like simpleton's logic
i can't imagine a worse plan of action
anyone suggesting that we revolt or try to revolutionize is saying this by proxy
as magistrate outlined earlier, change is gradual and you have to try and systematically improve things
the system isn't so drastically broken that it actually requires some kind of revolution
yet
i'm afraid it'll get that way, but not yet
anyone who has been directly impacted by trumpian policy cares
a lot
if you care then why the actual fuck are arguing for an outcome that'll perpetuate what we have now
as opposed to campaigning for a worse rapist
do you actually understand how our voting system wors
let's be clear, i'm not treating the presidential election as the end all be all
obviously downticket races are incredibly important too
but the president has unfortunately amassed greater executive powers and become a symbol of the country
i don't want biden as the symbol of this country
but i want trump a hell of a lot less
yeah, but 99% of people don't know about any of that shit
they understand voting
and most people don't even understand that
canis, don't derail conversations
because the alternative is arguably worse, if not certainly
yeah, i thought we learned our lesson by gauging things irl from how twitter sphere is doing
no bP, i'm not a political activist
i'm just calling it like i see it
i know that doesn't help very much, but i've got my own shit to worry about and it takes too much motivation to get out of bed as it is
adding door to door activism and canvassing on top of my already considerable responsibilities just makes my face hurt from frowning
the people who vote for a candidate are not limited to the people who actively endorse or support them
i have never canvassed for a candidate i liked,
i still voted for sanders
this is really fallacious reasoning
cool it a bit tm
i know
gets a bit hard to tell
HAHAHA
HOH HOH, IMPLYING THE VOTING SYSTEM IS THAT SIMPLE
sorry, my incredulousness was funnier in my head
i'm also ready to move on from this conversation, it's just making me feel tired and depressed
indeed, linkybot
indeed
oh that's not good
ah
that's better
i'm not about that life
i'm more about secluding myself in the woods somewhere
deep where no one can find me
and then i live in a poorly constructed shack until i die
that sounds fucking depressing solarsail
unfortuantely i can totally see it happening too, to us even
like, not the exact same thing exactly
but how much you wanna bet that at least one person who joined this server has since died
CONFOUND THOSE DOVER BOYS
rune contacts me every once in a while
they're really worried about the current pandemic, obviously
but they're okay so far
rune/carbink
i've met up with them twice irl for magfest
yeah
<:dot:712826472397537291>
uh
i don't remember shit about how unsong depicted hell
what exactly did it do different
uh
that's\
precisely what wtc hell is like too
it's more complex but it's still minmaxed suffering in service of the demons and devils who do it
yes, i did
<:annoyedpepe:314020944857268224>
i think you guys are exaggerating the differences in their depiction
i got basically the same shit out of it
if anything wtc hell is worse because of the sheer _amount_ of suffering
yawn
the fuck's the matter with you ZX computing
sourdough starter
aka bacterial soup
it's like kombucha but it leads to a better product
i'm late, but did someone say... scooby
<a:shaggy:423637406231560192>
wait a minute
that's supposed to be a gif
i guess discord is still borked
but yeah who even is this
i am not aware of.... libbie cyber oryx
unless i just forgot
i hate to sound constantly like a centrist, but you guys realize that there can be a range to this right
excellent idea tbh
what else would you look at it with
your butthole?
jesus fucking christ
i was not expecting that repartee
i'm always pleased when tori decides to talk in here
it hearkens back to a golden age
now is more like a silver age or something
maybe it's just me being nostalgic and tired
i miss when conversations were more rabid and animated
what we've got now is actually nicely structured compared to before, but it's not as active as i would like sometimes
yes, i need to clamp down on that
furries get brought up entirely too often in here
furries, truly the most oppressed class
holy fucking crap
that gpt post made me lose it
i had a tear coming out of my eye by the end of it
`I just realized John Cena vs. John Cena isn't a good idea.`
lies
you sound like you've witnessed some extremely colorful things in your time on this earth
wow, no one on terraria today
are we taking a break
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
we'll just have to see
i mean
we're playing on master mode
i'm pretty sure it's all meant to be unfair up to a certain point
i just got a user report on the subreddit
what the actual fuck am i looking at?
i think i want to ban this user? they have a shit ton of comments that are just like it on a bunch of fandom subs
yes, that's what's sticking in my craw
it's like /r/SelfAwareWolves
what the hell is an acidpisser
oh god, now i want to look it up misha
NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
that's enough google for today
i mean, i already knew about the concept, but i didn't know the acronym
my curiosity just killed me
i didn't do shit, own up to your mistakes
anyway, of course you did tensei
you are l33t
man, just typing "l33t" out made me sad
veli you've posted that meme twice now, you're lucky i find it funny or else you'd be dead
in seriousness, i think we're starting to hit like a wall with terraria
it's getting hard to keep up
before it was like 15 people all strengthening a boss together and now 4 of us with pretty decent equipment weren't able to do it
i think that the drop off will become even more pronounced than it was
select a few that you think are arbitrarily the best and then say "More information available upon request"
they'll probably never ask you for more, but it works
wait, hwat tori
chad alexander
i have nothing else to put into this conversation, my brain is mush
more of this please
how did they get the other one out
wait, what
i haven't heard of this but it sounds amazing
are there more details
super engineer over here
also roman era politics/war stories sound fucking insane
executing your own general to avoid reprisal?
sounds really stupid to me
what did caesar do
i'm practicing dodging
tired of getting killed so often
i realize i've been playing the game wrong, focusing too much on singular objects when i should be working on like
paying attention _generally_
so i never keep track of all the bullets or whatever i need to be dodging cuz i'm always looking at one enemy i want to kill
which is a bad idea
hwat

WHO IS THIS FINE FELLOW
tensei, what was that item list again
i accidentally closed my notepad without saving, lmao
sure
well, i just tried to fight the destroyer on my own time and was doing well, then he touched me and i was shredded instantly
the names, you charlatan
```Midway through ‚ÄúRobotnik Has a Viagra Overdose,‚Äù```
there are so many pieces to this article that can be cut out and framed
wow
i spent a bunch of time prepping and getting these accessories/items that would help me better in terraria
i tested them out a bit, was actually feeling pretty confident
spawned the destroyer
gibbed me in less than 15 seconds
none of those are identical
motherfucker are you colorblind
is that what the singularity is?
you will not go to school
you will not be fed
for i am your god
mine's better by leagues
starting to get pissed off about how much i enjoy playing terraria
i decided to try and do the tech tree for a cell phone
and of course, one of the foundational things you need is a compass
one of the ways you can get a compass is from viking enemies in the ice biome
but nobody bothered to put up hellevators to make sure the crimson biome wouldn't spread into it
so basically the entire ice biome was just fucking ruined
and i got so fucking pissed off at encountering crimson enemies that i decided to decontaminate the ice biome
i've been doing that for three hours
i've made about six hellevators
yeah
not that that means much
because those chests are completely fucked
either way, grumbling aside i actually feel kind of satisfied with my work
also at one point i got a bacon drop from an enemy
and it "majorly increases all stats"
which, naturally, i noticed an increase in my mining speed
so i got the idea to combine it with a mining potion really quick
and i tell you, i was almost mining fast enough to be in free fall while i did it
shroomite digging claws go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
i've got a crappy hallow farm up
very mediocre in quality but serviceable enough if people afk it
i honestly want to play through on normal mode
or maybe expert?
for funsies i decided to do eye of cthulhu on a classic mode normal server
and it was so fucking fun
just blasting the shit out of it
MY HUBRIS
also that's pewdiepie
oh yeah
<@!273994148825268224> were you still looking for vitamins? i got some in the dungeon
maybe not, it's been a while
crimson, right
then yeah
i'm tired, sorry
can always have more to work with
getting a cell phone is my next thing i guess
it doesn't seem particularly hard, just tedious
i think for the next few days i'll probably be taking it a bit slow
but the nice thing about this hallow farm i made today is that it's pretty much completely AFK
so i think what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna park my ass in the stone cage to stay safe and then just farm chaos elementals
hopefully can generate some rods of discord for people
also it's underground, just above the cave pylon
the space inside the stone cage is too small, they won't spawn or teleport inside it
where's the hallow farm that you're talking about tensei
oh yeah, i've used that one at some point
i forgot it existed
ah HAH
THE PLAN WAS A SUCCESS
i have obtained a second rod of discord
do you want it
then it's yours
i'm specifically grinding these out to give to other people for when we fight even harder bosses
this is how i know to help best
wat
alright, i'm reasonably certain that i've got a fully purified and insulated ice biome to play around in
this was a productive evening
also MENDOZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i can't believe torchluck became as big of a deal as it did
people working themselves into a fury over what's essentially nothing
god damn, i hated the monkey island quest
runescape's high level quests are all kind of insane
000010101110101011101010101010101011010010110111010100010101011........2
are you sure you're not overcomplicating it
a 1/10 chance of something happening is equivalent to 10%
if you double the chance of that happening, it becomes 20%, or 1/5
bah
god, it's not a good sign that i literally do not remember anything about what you're describing
like, that show did not leave an impression on my memory banks at all
what does it mean for twitter to break something
like, i instantly understood that to mean "boost its popularity"
but does it actually mean like
shoot it down
i am not familiar enough with the twitter sphere at all to understand this
it really do be like that doe
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
cancel fringe, stream avatar instead
i'm glad i'm not the only one who thought that
kaiser buns
god dammit
almost two years ago
the accident
wow, moonlord is fucking absurd
oh yeah
<@!273994148825268224> do you mind trying to get my hallow farm up to full luck
definitely want everyone possible to have a rod of discord
i'll look into that then
i think he's just meant to be an annoying precursor
once we're all outfitted we can exclusively put fragments towards crafting summons
instead of having to go through the process every single time
<:happybear:349682233352781825>
quality chart tm
oh, fucking christ
another one?
oh wait, this is a fan thing
automatically more excited
i don't know that we should announce it though
i think we're adopting a non-formal policy of not advertising fan shit
kettle
man, i'm missing out on cooking discussion? sad!
i'm packing unfortunately
WHOA
i think i've heard of potato pancakes but that still sounds fucking weird to me
why would i do such a thing when the very instructions say not to do it
someone didn't think this out very well
<:thenperish:396638304814104586>
i don't know why, but that's really funny to me
i'm still curious about that question to be honest
alas, we will never know probably
if only life were so grand
anyway, back to wtc i guess
LEATHER STORE
oh good, we're discussing wtc even if on a completely tangential level
i have a question
with joon's powers, ||there's the soft cap at level 20 for each skill where he can't get better with simple amateur training, but then after a certain point he's raising skills as high as 30 to 50. why is he able to do this all of a sudden?||
yes
but he's doing amateur training and getting them that high
i'm on chapter 174, for reference
go check it out, he's just doing amateur training and that shit's up to level 50

oh my god, you should
you absolutely should

i am officially demanding you make this
i haven't been keeping u with chili for months
it's funny but i've been distracted
<:howhigh:339608981582512128>
i think it's telling you to get drunk and try it bro
i mean, the fact that it's in rot13 makes it funny to me
but it's probably advisable not to have it
<:drewlinkaS:404057200622043137>

i don't know, all i'm thinking at this point is that there's probably a million things that could be done with arquius
it is decidedly not living up to its full potential, as amazing as it already is
<:ree:475542526791516170>

my most notable ban was mike blossom
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407107881767534602/485316229779685378/unknown.png
this was back in august of 2018
literally every time i think about that encounter, it makes me laugh
it's amazing how swiftly people can get pissed off at the ones managing stuff
i sometimes wonder about that but it's really not worth it most of the time
delicioso
oh, happy birthday!
i can't understand that mindset to be honest nat
dealing with users and realizing they're operating on bad faith always makes me depressed and angry
like, as soon as i figure out that's what's going on it just makes me handle them with extreme prejudice
that happens on a semi-regular basis
honestly it occurs in spurts
nothing for a while, and then for the span of a week you just get like a dozen of them
good, good

why are you like this andrew
jesus fucking christ, this is an actual disaster
did anyone think to download the video
<a:anumbersNUMBERS:394370289036820480>
i'm downloading this version with both of them
i can't fucking believe fesh pince got copyright struck
i'm going to cut the intro off, not that hard
either way, i am actually quite disturbed by this
i always think i should download videos just in case stuff like this happens, and i never do
no, no, we're not announcing this
it's serious but it's mostly relevant to just us
like, mspa-lit
hm
see you rina
ORDER IN THE COURT
@mspa-lit role is stupid idea but also maybe not
no, it wouldn't be gated against people who don't have the role
it's just that there's a lot of stuff that happens in this channel that has led to the development of a unique culture
it would be an opt in sort of thing, like "if you care about the stuff we all generally care about, then ask and you'll be clued in when shit happens that's relevant to us"
but that's kind of dumb and complicated
notifued
it's your fault nat
that's enoguh linkybot for today though
no, but that would be a hilarious hidden functionality
andrew that makes me think of the taurans or whatever from wow
okay, i've got fesh pince 1 and 2 both cut properly and saved individually on my computer
they will never be fully deleted
holy fucking shit
was that made by a neural net
you know, krobo doesn't get enoguh credit for one particular aspect of their videos that i think is incredibly important
in a lot of YTPs, they use buzzing noises and shit, and it's almost always earrapey
fesh pince 1 and 2 have those noises too but they're never too loud
very considerate
<@!712391057446273138> are you the one who was telling me about that one YTPer who edited videos in real time, and there was that one insane spongebob YTP
i can't find that video, can you link it
i need to experience the raw insanity
yes, _yes_
this is what i crave
oh god
i've watched this video all the way through twice before
i don't think i can bring myself to do it again, at least not right this second
sweet god, william
i always forget just how mind numbingly insane this is
it's hard to imagine that a real, living human being created it
no andrew, that's not really it
it has something to do with the sheer absurdity of it
it's in the sheer amount of editing
and how painfully things are repeated
and just ruthlessly edited into oblivion
yeah, and in that pain there is meaning
it gives life depth
with the emergency brakes one in particular, the constant speeding up and slowing down and the associated audio crunching hits at a very core piece of my being
it's almost primal in a way
what do you mean, who is david
what are you talking about
andrew, i mean look at this part https://youtu.be/er9zCAlm5Lk?t=351
like, these 10 seconds alone are perfect
it's just absolute lunacy
bah
you guys have yet to look into the void
you cannot understand
i commented on that at one point
i noticed that the pandemic hit and everyone started staying home, and suddenly the temperature plummeted
coincidence? i think NOT
>complaining about fesh pince
that's a paddlin'
it's a beautiful day
yay
i've been dead for weeks
i'll take care of it eventually
it's just hard to get the motivation up
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE RACED YOU
YOU MADE ME LOSE\
also makin, in case you haven't seen yet, fesh pince got fucking copyright struck
i hope your cat is okay tipsy
is it cheezeburger
cheezoid
fucking "cheezeburger"
cheezoid is a much better name
either way, i hope cheezoid is alright
i need to sleep though, i'll be back later
<@!165162590878695424> i tried fighting the destroyer by myself a few times and it one shot me whenever i got hit, it's literally just because it's master mode and it's insanely difficult
i think we're getting a warped view of this game
remember misha
no, don't
do not
yes, but the head hones in on you like a fuck
i kind of want to try fighting destroyer again, now that i have a bit more experience with dodging and shit
probably still gonna fucking die but i guess we'll see
look
i'm not good at this game
what <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
that's absurd
the entire deal of master mode is that the bosses are monstrous tanks
i fought him alone a couple times one night and he has like 80,000 HP or something
you know what? fuck it
i'm going to get online RIGHT NOW and give it a try
because you people are full of shit
yeah, i always use health pots during boss battles
oh
sometimes i use buffs
not as often as i should
i think i was finally sold on how good they are after i was mining with both apple pie and a mining pot
with shroomite digging claws and those, i was literally digging about as fast as i culd fall
i should stock up on some stuff before i try the fight
god dammit
i had developed a prediction about WTC yesterday that i thought was pretty important, but i can't remember what it is
instead, have a headcanon that i'm sure someone else thought of
WTC spoiler for anyone who might get exposed to this through linkybot: ||the phonogram that amaryllis listened to about shia labeouf? the voice speaking was exactly the same as rob cantor, the narrator for the original video, and it's utterly chock full of allusions and references to the meme, just sans a barber shop quartet||
e.g. "i stabbed him in his kidney," stuff of that nature
god, what was that prediction i had though
it actually felt kind of serious
what chapter are you on
RUNNING FOR YOUR LIF
GNAWING OFF YOUR LEG
fuck you
that sounds good
bah, i can't remember, time for terraria
that's kind of the idea though, isn't it?
based almost exclusively on D&D mechanics, and you never leave/split the party in tabletops
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
yeah i know
same as the old IP
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
same _version_
yes, download the update
no, i have no idea what that even is
makin we better watch more than one episode of avatar today
because it's fucking good and one episode isn't enough to be satisfying
everyone wants that, you are just a wiener
shut up mark twain
are you serious
i have shit to do
god, fine
but i'm leaving as soon as we fail
we can yell at people to knock it off
the y
i should pay attention to the chat but i really want to play halo 2
so i'm just ognna play halo 2
<@!205026834205769748> nooo
carl, i can't stop laughing at this because i can't even tell what the fuck it's supposed to be
what is going on in this picture
yeah, you fuck
i just have my starcells do the work for me
what kind of caveman do you think i am
lava pits
get fucked
acid SHOULD be a thing in terraria
<@!207991389613457408> i'm finally getting back to my halo 2 playthrough now that terraria fever has died down somewhat
i'm keeping a list of notes as i play
writing down all the things i find good, bad, or just generally interesting
i'll get back to you with my thoughts if you want to hear them
they're just roughshod notes, not an essay
but sure
i played a little bit with dero the other night
are you playing anniversary or original 2
i played a bit of halo 2 anniversary's infection
it was.... extremely weird
coming off of reach
griffball?? really
okay
maybe we can play some together
team death match and death match
oddball, king of the hill, and other stuff like that doesn't really capture most people's interest
also do you mean the multiplayer in particular misha or like in general
because for me the parts of h4 that sucked were all single player
i haven't even played 5 so i can't really comment, although it looks like unfettered shit
i have never played halo wars 2, but like
even as i'm going through halo 2, i'm starting to think that not all of my appreciation for this game is mired in just nostalgia
like it's genuinely fucking good in a lot of respects
it makes me want to play more games in a way that i haven't felt since i was a kid
i don't even know how to explain it, there's just some kind of ineffable quality to halo 2 that makes me love the shit out of it
i feel like 343 does lighting badly
or i'm not sure really
either way, i'm not surprised, because both halo CE anniversary and halo 2 anniversary are both really fucking good looking games
like, really, they are extremely nice upgrades
but the thing is that 343 basically had a complete scaffold to work off of
halo 4 and halo 5 are both uniquely new projects that were helmed by them exclusively
i'm not surprised that they got the tone and design all fucked up
here's one of my notes for halo 2
good things include: banter
there is a lot of variously toned banter in this game
i haven't played halo 4 in years but i'm pretty sure that the tone of that game was way more dour in general
and there was like very little banter
yeah, i think i agree
i'm starting to notice a lot of the tonal and design shifts that reach was responsible for
and i'm starting to hate that game for it
reach ruined halo
i wonder if there's a singly identifiable point where the tone and lore of halo was ruined
or if it was just a general shift
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
well, i think we're all in agreeance that reach fucking sucks, at least from a story perspective
i find it harder to talk about it technically, although it does fail a lot in that regard imo
that's kind of the thing
in the halo universe every ship DOES have an AI
they're not all cute waifus but AIs are a universal thing, they literally have a protocol that dictates they should destroy shipboard AI if captured
you know, hot take, but the early halo novelizations really aren't that bad
in a lot of respects i actually kind of like them
ah, right
you know what
i was actually thinking about johnson earlier, and how he's killed in 3
i think that may have been where things went wrong
in the sense that bungie at that point had two options
they could either have killed the series there and ended it on possibly the best ending they could have gotten for where they were taking the story
but money
so what they SHOULD have done
was keep johnson alive
that's the alternate universe right there
wow, has bungie gotten _that bad_
it's weird
because i activated one of the terminals for halo 2 anniversary
the extra story didn't feel... _bad_
it felt serviceable enough
but somehow the way it was presented sucked?
very up its own ass, i think misha was onto something
no
i don't mind interrupting the gameplay, as long as the terminals are in completely off areas that actually require effort to find
like, terminals should be for people who are specifically looking for them
that's how they did them in halo 3
in halo 2? i agree
yes, that too
i'm trying to illustrate that the way terminals were done in CEA and 2A sucked hard
but in halo 3 they were actually pretty neat?
i think 343 is just really hamfisted in terms of presentation of story
what is it with you and fred fuckstone
explain the nuances
no
disgruntled employee?
jesus fucking christ i am in love with halo 2
to be sure, there is a lot of jank with halo 2
the graphical touch-up has done wonders for it visually
i tried switching in between classic and anniversary
and i was fucking astounded at just how bad the original looks at times
at least in comparison
then i remember that it came out over 15 years ago
such is life
two types of users
dingus went soft
i had to take him out back behind the shed
i deactivated it in here
wow, that actually caught me off guard
the interview is an okay movie
pretty standard for james franco and seth rogan
depends on who you ask
i think the concept of the character was kind of unwoke but the way she was treated diegetically was woke???? it's weird
alright, fine
well that was fun
you know, i kind of want to play again but on classic mode, just to see how much easier it is by compariosn
especially with end game gear
the more i think about it, the more i actually do want to go through classic terraria world with end game gear, just to see how it feels to be a god
i'll host a server for it tomorrow, unless a surplus of people are around right now and want to give it a go
fair to me
<@&711911237700681789> in celebration of beating master mode, we're going to be doing a really quick run through classic mode. don't make new characters, we're going through with all of our gear to see just how much easier it is in comparison to the shitfest that was master mode
this will be tomorrow afternoon EST, so don't worry for now
yeah rina, go ahead
go hog wild, this will be a romp
if you would, cheat me in a zenith
it sounds fun but i am NOT grinding these swords out
also a cell phone
i'll try an item server i guess
any suggestions?
ree ree fine
i'm not sure there's another way to shill it, except maybe totally ironically
it's just a fascinating look into someone's warped, twisted mind
gnawms, i'm farther into the game now and i have to agree that there are some things i really don't like in retrospect
i don't think that they're enough to make me un-love the game but it's just like "this is not good design"
halo 2
the thing i hate the most is making you fight multiple waves of enemies in the same spot
this also happened in halo CE a couple of times but to nearly the same degree
get better opinions then 4head
but nah what the fuck is iconoclasts
never
<@!207991389613457408> Come out! Your death will be quick and painless.
oracle? why do you insist on calling me that? i am 343 guilty spark, monitor of installation 04
yeah, isn't it great
BAD ON PURPOSE
jesus fucking christ
i haven't thought of stick RPG in like 15 years
`wow, 15 years... you must feel emotions.`
i have no idea what i want to do with myself now that i've beaten halo 2
again
i guess there's the romp thorugh classic mode terraria tomorrow
that'll be good
maybe i should start playing majora's mask randomized
what do you do, sein
too rich for my blood
stuff can grow in clay, you just might need to water it more
clay can hold more water but by the same token not as much gets to the plants
if stuff you plant struggles to take or grow, then you might want to consult a farmer
or invest in some topsoil
it's like 5 bucks a bag
if even that
now that i actually understand how spies and religion work i'll have to give civ 6 another try sometime
i don't like how it looks still, but i'm sure it's got oodles of new shit to do
<a:kermitnod:440188350058594324>
i need to finish rereading wtc
it's taken much less time than i thought somehow
+progress
poggers, etc
well, when you look at the state of homestuck now, it's hard not to think about it
what's the one webcomic that's just a bunch of weird faces shouting nonsequiturs at each other
i want to say "vomit city" but i'm pretty sure that's wrong
yes good thank you tori
FUCKING YES
JERK CITY
tera, i am 0% surprised that david lynch is the man responsible for that comic
it's great though, and reminds me of a comic that my dad and uncle made when they were kids
i can't remember the name, it was something weird andn erdy
but it was rather crude in a lot of ways
one of the recurring characters was an evil dog who shat on everything
that's some good boomer humor right there
>couplet gatekeeping
get outta here
i will never stop being angry about that, to be honest
even just passively
what an awful, awful, awful time
truly the worst fucking thing
terrible
i think we got that one at some actually, interesting
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
what's up actual tera
i was going to order a copy of robert's rules of order in brief actually
i'm curious about parliamentary procedure
so if you're interested in having more effective meetings, i'd recommend picking that up
otherwise, i'm not sure
have you ever played halo
you should, it's fun
i'd offer to grab you a copy of master chief collection but i honestly need to not spend money for a while
what, the classic mode romp?
i guess i'd be down to play thorium sometime
expert mode feels like it'd be better than master mode
i'm not sure how it'll feel going from one to the other
getting a fully flying mount so early is practically cheating anyway
i guess at that difficulty level it's kind of warranted though
does it help if everyone present is familiar with them
or is it more of a professional obligation thing, where everyone has to actively want to follow them
moonjail i'm sorry, but that's the funniest petty horseshit i've ever heard
this only makes me want to learn the rules of order even more
look
at a certain point, civility takes a back seat to entertainment
i will absolutely read through the rules at least in brief if it means i get to impose completely ridiculous standards of communication here
nah, it'd just be fun to call shit out sometimes
you can't see it but i'm rubbing my hands together fervently
i rise to a question of privilege: moonjail is being a fucking wet blanket
i move to suspend the rules
all in favor?
point of order: maintain decorum or else risk ejection from the room
i'm dictator for life so if i step in, my word is immediately law
having variable voting counts for different levels of mods is sensible though
i've actually wanted to figure this out for a while, even if it would never be realistically useable
overruled
wait that's not a rules of order thing is it
the president can't suspend acknowledgement unilaterally?
is there a position above president then
what is bercow considered
or was considered, when he presided in the house of commons
no, this is great
i am enjoying it immensely and we haven't done anything legit with it
see, this is why i want to actually read the rules
this cheat sheet is great
but in order to formalize things i need to actually get through the book a bit
i need it for nothing other than my own amusement
<:ree:475542526791516170>
okay, so there are some fundamental things that need to be established
what constitutes a docket
and how is a meeting called to order
is the president a facilitator of this
so what constitutes a motion
i assume then that a docket would simply be a list of motions
but can a motion be anything? i would assume that they're typically like items in a list that need to be discussed
what? what's the point of _moving_ to begin congress and parliament
wouldn't it by default be in progress as part of calling the meeting to order
administrative/clerical matters such as taking roll?
and is quorum a hard defined thing or is it determined by bylaws?
god, i have the stupidest grin on my face hearing about all this
this is fucking ridiculous and i love it
this is just delightful
ah, that's never fun
hm
what was the callback
i guess i missed something very interesting
i was busy finishing halo 2 earlier, not surprised i missed it
if you have message links i can take a look
that conversation was fine honestly
are you squicked out because of the originating material solely or what
yeah, you're being weird
i have no idea what that word even means
i mean, i can craft guesses
but that's a waste of time
ah, okay
i understand what's happening now
i was curious about that, the cheat sheet implied there was such
is it a point of order if someone is clearly misusing the rules to be a petty dickwad
or are you forced to eat it
unpopular opinion occupies two different states 98% of the time
one state is hardline conservative opinions that have no place in modern society
the other state is opinions that actually aren't all that unpopular and are just karma whoring
the other 2% are genuinely unpopular opinions, and they usually get downvoted to hell
which makes the subreddit effectively useless
yeah, we talked about this some weeks ago
as it is, i'm not sure where this 9/11 one fits
see, now this is a quality post

fuck, i should really get some sleep
<:harold:423256024984846356>
i have to agree, early game was a slog and i kind of hated it
terraria only gets fun once you're in hardmode
and even then it takes a bit of effort to get those ores, i think once you have a mythril or whatever drill it picks up in earnest
it's possible that this was planned and is part of an effort to officially finish transferring things over and fix all the broken shit
HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHH as if that would ever happen

it's a bit stilted but it's not terrible
the prose is a different thing
i don't think anyone has said anything
i haven't contacted the liaisons yet, not sure if it would amount to much on this particular topic
but also yes, i think it's wise to give it some time
viz and/or the official team _might_ be working on it already
i'm not going to hold my breath, but time will tell i guess
yeah, i feel you
that's kind of the thing, yeah

yeah, h2a multiplayer sounds fun
let's do it sometime, but the timing is weird cuz i'm moving and all
Altgen is closing for a while due to excessive unacceptable and inappropriate content. We will consider bringing it back in the near future, provided acceptable behavior from users.
if people from altgen (or anyone, really) comes in here to try and fuck the place up or whine excessively (read: more than a couple times in a short time span, and in an inappropriate manner) then let mods know so we can handle it
we specifically locked down altgen because we were seeing a really sharp increase in the kinds of posts that we do NOT want to see in there
this is our way of initiating a hard or soft resest
since it's clear that altgen can't be trusted to not constantly toe the line, we've just removed the element of shitposting with wild abandon
might be permanent, might not be
whether or not it's permanent depends on how well people react to its disappearance and how willing they are to follow the rules elsewhere
we'll see how it shakes out
if people disrupt other channels over this, then they're banned
that's how it works
if people complain excessively, as deemed by mod fiat, then they'll get warned off and/or banned
<@!266807632390520833> the response to altgen getting closed isn't as bad as i thought it would be, so i can probably start it up now
i didn't bother getting maxed out weapons but i don't think i'll need them so who cares
shut UP
<@&711911237700681789> alright everyone, it's time to start our rush through of classic mode terraria with end game shit. let's break the fuck out of this game, join me through steam
oh yeah, sorry
password is bepis
thought that was obvious <:tenseiface:354759649016152074>
right click my name, join game
lmao
hm
i _think_ invite to lobby is right
it doesn't actually say "invite to game" anywhere, which is weird
<@!292581366233825280> there were an absurd amount of posts in recent weeks that blew past the line of acceptability for what we're willing to tolerate, including memes about being a pedophile or grooming children
this is a hard reset at best
altgen may come back but it will not come back with the same kind of laxitude we were dealing it before
well, i would recommend straightening out newcomers to gen and making them understand the etiquette and culture you've built up here
that's how these sorts of mergers always work
it's not ideal, but neither is keeping a channel around that has a bad environment
it's copying the template of a meme without adding anything unique to it
very lazy posting basically
we've experienced an altgen exodus before
their new server died in less than a year
if you link it, you're banned

no nost, we're still going just fine
god, what an absolutely great time
i'll miss you terraria

WHERE'S THE BEEF? <:SHIALABEOUF:532559243270946816>
yeah, terraria has a lot of depth and cool shit to it
i'm glad we all played together
it was easily one of the best multiplayer experiences i've had recently
1
eating all the bodies
oh, i lied
i actually pronounce it like 2
made me laugh, fuck you
i mean, strictly speaking i'm sure that having more people was actually a net boon because of the sheer number of bodies you could throw at the bosses
by the time the last people died, the new wave of fighters would appear
me irl
it just needs a reset
or not
i guess we'll see
that's patently false umbra
the shitposts by themselves are enough to distinguish altgen, but more salient is the fact that some of those shitposts are fucking terrible
not just terrible as in "unfunny" but genuinely awful content
the precise example that made us consider this course of action in the first place was a large string of memes that said shit to the effect of "i am a pedophile" or "i groom children"
we treat shit like that with extreme prejudice, it is not to be tolerated here
also intensely racist shit
we're stamping that out right now
i earnestly think that this wasn't happening until recently
but users have been increasingly toeing the line and pushing boundaries
it's time for a reset, regardless of what happens
<a:THINKCEPTION:492742586411384853>
yes, that would be optimal rina
but as i said before, altgen users tend to toe the line and push boundaries with rules in there, and eventually an emergent culture establishes itself
see, people keep suggesting shit like that\
"make it more inviting"
but being more punishing actually accomplishes the opposite of that
it's not as simple a suggestion as you make it seem
this blend of culture is honestly way better than i expected
holy fuck it's based deus
the numbers for today were already interesting, but not by much
about 7,500 for gen
the average is about 4,500
per day
as i said in gen, the blend of culture i'm seeing is actually very interesting and greater than i expected it to be
i'm hoping that it continues to be productive and not devolve into bullshit
ah, right, i wanted to mention
IF altgen comes back, prime and raar have established a set of rules to enforce on altgen
which feels kind of antithetical to its existence, but it's hopelessly clear that it just can't exist as a place with fluid rules
rule 0 isn't enough to constrain people who actively seek to push it as hard as possible
general seems to have taken the spot of hangout
and altgen is gen
<a:think_vibrate:423261268015841290>

irreverent humor is a keystone of this channel actually
but not when that humor is dumb as shit
highly disagree
troll reproduction actually had a modicum of thought put into it, and the joke was overplayed so hard that it wrapped back around into funny
yiffy is like surface level humor at best
president insane clown posse is much closer than troll reproduction but there was still at least some extensive explanation in it
it's just not funny and its execution is extremely lazy
that's what it boils down to
troll reproduction being carefully and laboriously explained/the presidency of earth being handed over to a couple of juggalos as the tool of an alien fish queen are both more interesting even just conceptually, and the amount of effort/thought put into them was orders of magnitude greater than anything related to "yiffy"
<:NotLikeThis:507285193988767744>
i wouldn't even mind that this is where the comic is going, mind you
but it's just
so boring
ever since someone on the subreddit talked about it in such terms, i can't help but perceive hs2 as this disjointed product that lacks a central theme or heart to it
you will pay the price for your lack of ~~vision~~ focus
i think i take issue with the way that post frames some of this, but in general i find myself agreeing
homestuck literally starts with explicit escapism
john and the other kids get sucked away from a (relatively) dull and boring life into a video game universe
```It doesn't make any sense. It's fucking stupid. What you need here is elevation. There has to be something happening here that's actually funny. WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING HERE?```
i would be fine with not having that ifnar, but only if they had like
a throwaway line for it
like "i needed personal time away from planning"
maybe a panel of rose or kanaya trying to shut the door on insistent soldiers trying to obtain commands
and then they go into personal stuff
that would be a sensible transition
i mean
i'm not saying that it's particularly realistic misha
i'm just saying that it could be very easily explained
instead things just sort of happen with no sense of continuity from one scene to the next
navelgazing?
nah, maybe not

godtier powers getting transferred to offspring is... actually an interesting concept
oh, that's stupid

my personal prediction is that those fan ideas and theories are all better than whatever the actual result will be

despite all of my ranting and grumbling in here i wouldn't really consider myself that good of a judge of quality

nights left a hole in this channel that never quite got filled back up
she started a different account, she felt there was too much stuff attached to her old one
she's doing fine, no worries

jesus christ
i thought i had a cutout of the sphinx but i guess not
i mean, this is the internet
who lies on the internet
yeah, we really did a deep dive into our past
but... what of our future?
i'm not sure about underground, i thought it was a bigass dome
what in the actual fuck kind of sword is that
i need to play ffvi, i didn't get very far through it
what in the FUCK
am i looking at
we gave you all too much
now you're hooked
1-5 times, you can quit
more than 5 times, you're hopelessly addicted
if you do it 99 times, you die
if you quit cold turkey, you die
to be fair, it's impossible to tell it's marquis until she fucking says it's her
she ALWAYS changes her name and profile pic, makes me angery tbh
wort wort wort

dingus was temporarily removed from the team at his request
yes, i reinstated him today
change can be good but not always
get fucked teehee
over 11,000 messages in this channel today
fascinating.jpg
well, if it means anything, we're pretty pleased with how the reaction has gone
there have been some shitters but not a lot
the vast majority of people have been good
excuse me
strider, that's fucking terrible
don't say anything like that again or you're temp banned
<@!213413608732884994> i command you to tell me what this means https://imgur.com/mMbTC7M
i saw it on /r/all
lmao, is that really what it says
that's great
that's actually accurate because i appreciate gnawms a lot
his sense of humor gets me good
you have one hour
less if you abuse it
sure, why not
they don't deserve saving
star trek really feeling this energy today
oh man this is vaporwave
star trek: aesthetic
that would be too hard
people, gnawms
what's not to understand
you dink
i still want to play PTU
but i think my issue is that i get too into the "play with your pokemon" aspect of it
i've always hated the distance that you have from your pokemon in the games
and how you end up treating most of them in a similar manner
but that's not very fun i think for DMs to deal with
so i would probably be a miserable PTU player
combat in PTU takes so long, but the more i play tabletop the more i feel like that's just common
look
ptu can be fun
i stand by this
I JUST WANT A GOOD POKEMON GAME GOD DAMN IT
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR
<:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
`i seduce the dragon`
<:tereziFuck:585539573539405868>
you know, i haven't played barebones d&d
i think my last time doing so was back when i started college
so easily over 5 or 6 years ago
yeah, maybe
i don't know
not really sure i want to get into the commitment of a ttrpg right now
i'm technically still playing vampire with misha and his ilk
i keep thinking about it and i really like the casual magic of d&d
it's a different flavor from the shit i'm used to now
casual is the wrong word probably
stereotypical?
yes
it's stereotypical magic
well fuck you people then
yeah, but then i began slacking off and that really helped kill it off afte a while
just had no motivation to make sprites or maps
it was fun for a while though
i don't remember that, but i should have taken you up on it
absurdity
that's usually the reason any non sequitur or otherwise nonsensical humor works
if the absurdity is strong enough or of a particular flavor, it's funny
absurd and nonsense are two different, if related things
<@!528029289334046720> you're perfectly free to leave if you don't enjoy the way we do things
if i remember you messaged me a few days ago saying that mods were destroying altgen, actually
no, because there are like a dozen channels and i have a life outside of this server to begin with
also stop fucking talking about badhorse
he was a shitty user and people praising him after getting banned is absurd and stupid, as well as annoying
we've had a few altgen """martyrs""" over the years
none of them deserved the title
~~it's closer to 5-10 a day~~
no, honesty is important
right, i forgot we actually keep track of that now
we see how many people leave or join at the end of each day in UTC time
it's usually around 20-40 who join and 10-20 who leave
very strange
this one user is complaining about another user we banned in altgen literally months ago
it's very tiresome
well fucking stop bringing up badhorse then
seems pretty simple to me
this is talking, we are currently talking
what's not to love
they were being archived
this is the general purpose channel, people are allowed to discuss whatever they want here
as it is, i actually agree with that idea gnost
you know how many messages this channel had today?
over 11,000
that's entirely too many messages for stable conversation, depending on how many unique people rae talking
"Fat Husky" is an in-joke
a lot of people on this server have fondness for a literal fat husky dog that was in the news or something some years ago
so that's basically the animal pictures channel, we just call it fathusky for server culture reasons
gnost, didn't you just get done saying that all of the other homestuck related servers died out
obviously we're doing something right
i have no idea who or what those are
no, we are not affiliated with homesmut anymore
haven't been for some time
we have one person complaining about altgen and how this server works
we have a few newcomers who are confused and overwhelmed by all the history and in-jokes
everyone else is fine
well jake, i ahve a couple of solutions
1) i literally wrote a document that laboriously explains the history of our server, you're welcome to read that a bit if it'll help you to understand
2) more likely, you'll just have to hang out in here and see how stuff works
that's how all internet communities work
it's over 700 pages <:tenseiface:354759649016152074>
<:howHigh:585576558916272142>
yeah, most people abandon ship when i say that
anyway, here's the website if any of you are interested: https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/SPATfrontcover.html
<@!528029289334046720> i'm usually fine with people voicing their complaints but you're starting to drift into whinging territory
>altgen
>wholesome
hell to the no
<@!218439726565294081> knock it off, that's getting into shitposting territory
<@!528029289334046720> most of altgen has been mixing just fine, you are literally the only one complaining
at least this much anyway
<@!542086093776879616> for simple mentions i don't usually ask permission, people are always free to ask me to remove them from the document
if you want to look for references to your name, then i suggest you use the google docs instead
way more searchable because you can go by year instead of month
i'm splitting my attention between multiple places and people right now
getting annoyed at people asking me to unban others
in case any of you are thinking of doing that
<@!231291837812441099> i linked it very recently, search from: me contains: link
yofigi posted memes to the effect of "i am a pedophile" and "i groom children"
we treat that sort of shit with extreme prejudice
like, one of our utmost concerns is ensuring the safety of our users, especially with how many younger people are on this server
that having been said, i've been contacted by no less than like 4 people who are all personally appealing for him to get unbanned because "they were just memes, he didn't realize it was wrong" and "he wasn't properly warned"
i think it's pretty commonsense not to post shit like that
the second argument is more sensible to me, he probably just needed a temp ban and not a perma
but i really, really, really don't want to establish a precedent where we tolerate that sort of thing in the slightest
i probably need to talk with the mod team about it
i'm trying to make sure we talk about things as a council and that i'm not being a dictator
andrew
hold on, i promised i would get back to cicada after a second, i wanted to get a drink of water to calm down a bit
all of this has been rather agitating
i'll be back later
not too much later, just taking a few minutes
üî™
he who speaks the truth must be silence
but nah
also, i brought up the issue of the altgen ban with regard to pedophilia jokes
after discussing it even just a bit, we think it was perfectly deserved
as one mod said we absolutely "must give no quarter" to that kind of thing
if altgen goes back up we'll have extremely strict and explicit warnings against such memes, and anyone who breaks the rule is getting perma'd without mercy
that's just how it'll have to be
the inverse of a martyr? a sacrifice?
<@!342822501132402690> you actually posted something similar
not nearly as graphic but still uancceptable
yes, you did, i have the image up in mod chat literally right now
the only reason you're not banned is because time has passed and the embers have cooled
consider yourself lucky
also that is a fucking terrible explanation
it makes me reconsider leaving you unscathed
night jake simp
also, he legitimately left over that
i guess this is just more weeding out the bad users then <:ree:475542526791516170>
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
my soul is tired
what is chapo anyway
i have, i just don't know what it is
also sure, we can keep that pin

i got like an hour into disco elysium and ten stopped
that's what i'm banking on
i've held a salamander
it was cute as fuck

holy SHIT
it is a magical creature
we need one
right now
NO
ah yes, i remember reading about that sea slug at some point
pretty fascinating stuff
linkybot must wait, animals are being posted
<a:seething:523288464473718814>
keel you have to put at least a little more effort into it than that
posting a one-off message is almost never enough to derail
oversight?
oh, i'm a bit late but i actually have a sundew
i could go take a picture of it right now
aight one second


His name is Craig Ferguson
BR posting is verboten
good response, linkybot

symbol from a dream i had once
it's supposed to represent a willow tree
people see it as a lot of different things though
no, this was in like high school
i've had this image (although a much rougher version of it at first) for like 8 years
thanks to people on this discord even
oh lmao
i haven't been paying much attention to the fringe streams
i don't think i enjoy the show enough
i'm there for the avatar and then i just keep fringe on in the background
fringe refers to "fringe science"
fringe is about an FBI agent who works with a mad scientist to solve weird crimes
it's a good show, it's just not really for me i think
~~TYPO~~ CURSING IN THE GROUP CHAT? GET THEIR ASS
in what list
of terrible sequels?
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
still, more people playing halo
good shit
too bad only halo 3 is 4 player campaign
yeah, but reach is... reach
odst is good though
HEY
YOU'RE FINALLY AWAKE
maybe i should boot up TESO today to see what it looks like
still haven't given it a try
tensei pls
oh god, please no
i've looked forward to seeing black marsh for a while
why would they do this
STOP
YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW
<@!168980988477702145> what mods are you thinking
booooooooooooooooooooooo
i think i'm weird for liking paper mario 64 as much as i do
i enjoy it a lot more than a thousand year door and WAY more than super paper mario
and i haven't bothered to play any of the others
i kind of hated super paper mario to be honest
not actively hated, but i was really disappointed in it
i liked the casual JRPG style and the story was just really underwhelming for me
when you put it like that, i'm definitely not weird
mines is infamous for having extremely odd duck taste
they hate the original star wars, enough said
that made me ugly laugh, thank you misha
... have they?
what about the newer charlie and the chocolate factory
i guess that wasn't quite on the level of the cat and the hat
_demon_
are you saying you don't enjoy watching little people dance for our amusement whilst singing platitudinal songs?
newer as in "not the older one" you fucking dink

GOODBYE, EARTH.
this immediately comes across as a very weird concept
SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO
i'm not that learned, okay
all i know is that it sounds fucking great
lmao
dude, i don't want to use epic store
i don't care what they make free
you guys are falling for a very obvious ploy
stop ruining my glee at learning of the yamato by bringing up the epic store
i would seriously rather pay for civ 6 and all its DLC on steam than get it for free on epic games store
alright, now i can take a look
ah, it's just the frontier pass(?) that's on humble bundle, and it's not even on sale i think
base game is still 60 bucks, i'll pass
age of empires 2 with a shit ton of people actually sounds really fun
i'd get killed really quick but it'd still be fun
oh _shit_
that actually seems like a really decent deal
also yes tensei, it does
snagged, thanks negadrew
we are closer than ever to an HSD civilization game
the netcode is completely awful
civ games are long, but they take even longer when people aren't even able to play <:tenseiface:354759649016152074>
seriously, we tried playing civ V together and moves either took 5 minutes to complete because the netcode was so bad, or they didn't work at all
we didn't make it past round 6
i still worship the flying spaghetti monster, _in my heart_
did they have military academy back in those days?
i assume they had something like that
and if they didn't they died
good shit
i've never considered how weird it is that we have such relatively tight records of people who actually lived back then and what they did
like, marc anthony isn't the product of a story that might have been true but was probably embellished
like, that was a real fucking person
god i love history
where do you learn all this shit
are there books i can read
podcasts and youtube educational videos are fine and all, but when it comes to old shit i prefer reading straight from the source
lemme see if they list anything
oh YES they do
i've already read the histories, i was going to pick up xenophon's stuff eventually and read that next
herodotus obviously got a lot of stuff wrong, but i think historians tend to agree that he was like
pretty overtly considering things from a storytelling perspective as well as historical
which is interesting and makes sense if your intent is to draw an audience
one of my favorite excerpts is about the man-sized gold digging ants
native to india
god damn, i really wish i was more well versed in history in general
it's never been a huge part of my education though
need to pick up some authoritative texts
hm
this is probably one of the worst flights to have a failure on, in terms of establishing precedent
get fucked
dingus that's fucking depressing
oh yeah, that episode
it's probably for the best that we stopped on jet
<:yikes:294612676770922498>
holy shit, that got me good
thank you solar
fucking christ, the trombone waggle is so good
they don't change the note through the entire god damn jingle
that's pretty good control on the slide
considering they have to constantly plunge it every time they play the note
holy _shit_
this theme woke up memories inside me that i didn't even know i had
<@!207991389613457408> man, i am surprised at how quickly i fell back into my skill at playing gears of war
i'm almost through the first one on hardcore and i am having a fucking _blast_
halo 2 and gears of war
what is this, 2006?
older than the internet itself
having two general channels is probably a good idea all things said and done, this is ridiculous
the meld hasn't been as tumultuous as i thought it would be, but this is entirely too many messages in one channel each day
people have also generally been pretty understanding and behaving themselves well
i think altgen deserves to come back
but not yet <:hussieYouKnow:585545047005593610>
it'll probably be on friday, for no other reason than i'm moving across the country and it's gonna take a couple days where i'll be totally out of commission
good cheese post
good morning jake simp
it's 8 PM over here
yeah, this is basically a public mod hangout and there's definitely more of an emphasis on literature
we have a list of favorites
makin has a list of favorites
comics are definitely involved
webcomics are more difficult for some reason
we rely on acronyms too much to be honest
i have the dubious distinction of still reading questionable content every single weeknight when it comes out
i don't even like the webcomic anymore
it's just a force of habit
it's gotten extremely predictable and the pace is slow as balls
as long as jeph is raking in the money though, i don't see it going away anytime soon
not the gay ones
i also read xkcd when they come out, i feel just fine about that one
<:howSmush:359301099758551053>

i have no idea what happened
<@!184545248930693120> the editing on this is very smooth, it's kind of taking me by surprise
the sentence crafting is superb in some places
this ytp cy shared
it's got lots of literal dildos in it so i won't link it here
lmao, jesus
yeah, itj ust keeps getting worse
i can't believe how many dildos there are in this video
easily upwards of several hundred
yes
good lord i'm impressed with the quality of the editing
it's not necessarily my kind of humor but the sheer editing skill alone is amazing

oh god oh fuck someone wake up england

bear in mind, no wtc spoilers
magistrate is very early in
so watch your tongue
yeah, wtc is basically our group book we all care about to some degree or another
the entirety of book 1 is variously decent or sucks
but the story gets very good and only ever seems to increase in quality
here's a link, you should give it a shot https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126

here, watch this

dude, civilization VI is... fucking weird
i think i really am not into the aesthetic of it, or the mechanical changes
i'll give it some time though
i don't understand, what's the difference exactly
hm
which game is this for
lmao, really
that's fucking strange
```Diamond and Pearl Harbor```
twitter comments are unbelievable
tipsy's mastery of coming into conversations late without reading context is honestly quite frightening
can you never speak again in your life
less than half a year ago, youch
such a weird fucking yeet
you fucks
lmao, what the fuck?
this reminds me of a couple years ago or so
there's an amusement park near kansas city called worlds of fun, and one night out of nowhere there were suddenly HUNDREDS of children that stormed the place at night, the park had to call in the entire local police force to take care of them
born 2 shit, forced 2 wipe
i still have no idea
my clipboard had a link to my resume that i just filled out, so i'm not posting that for obvious reasons
YEET
yeah
i know, i know
catch up on fringe
aight i'll get on it
no
he already reads worth the candle, so he has that going for him, which is nice
my first response is "what the fuck is a jansport"
oh it's just a stereotypical normal backpack
uh, that would be a real dick move of you i guess, cuz the gameboy would probably get confiscated for the date
uh, i mean _day_
yeah, but are you really the kind of guy who snitches on other students for minor violations
i was almost the kind of nerd who would raise my hand if the teacher forgot to pass out homework, but not even i did shit like that
aw, beeger almost looks like a mortal entity in that picture
as opposed to this
where's the other one
i can't ever seem to find it
not quickly, but yeah, i actually have a few chapters done
five chapters and i've been conceptualizing how to move forward
oh yeah, that's real
that was a really fucking terrible time in high school
also yeah, i was kind of hoping i would have made more progress at this point, but i've been busy so i can't be too upset
it's been a while so i forget dero
i once saw a few fellow students write a bomb threat on the bathroom stall, told staff, our school got evacuated for the rest of the day
the next day i mentioned that i might know who wrote the threat, got forced to go tell the principle
the students didn't get suspended or expelled or anything, but next time i saw them they smacked M&Ms out of my hand
like bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you
yeah well maybe i DON'T want to participate, you ever THINK ABOUT **THAT?**
STOP IT YOU'RE SCARING HIM
such is life in 2020

if we can get a cut of gachimuchi with all of the explicit stuff removed (a tall order, I know,) i would unironically consider screening it to a VERY SELECT audience

i'll take a look at it and maybe cobble together an edit that could feasibly be watched
i highly doubt it, but i guess we'll see
what i'm trying to say is... bro, it's... it's me, bro. i want to talk to you about me, bro
i thought i saw Divine in IWF 2016 for a second
it probably wasn't, but still
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, to a conservative middle-class family, Milstead developed an early interest in drag while working as a women's hairdresser. By the mid-1960s he had embraced the city's countercultural scene and befriended Waters, who gave him the name "Divine" and the tagline of "the most beautiful woman in the world, almost."

international wrestling festival is one of those things that makes me take a step back and really consider how esoteric internet culture can get
i don't think there's anything else quite like it in the world
holy fucking crap <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
dumbass
i love gachimuchi but sometimes it reminds me that billy herrington is dead, and it makes me sad to think we have lost an angel well before his time
night nostalgo
but you DIDN'T
what a delightful evening this has been
probably not, repeat
oh
i mean, based on what
compatibility?
i can at least take a loo
poop ballsack the brown
i live solely for the next time i laugh that hard
every few months or so i get hit by something that inexplicably makes me laugh so hard i nearly vomit
full on wheezing, literally unable to draw breath because every single gasp is immediately pushed back out
those moments are great
dude, as soon as you said "is that his actual name" it was over
jesus fuck, what a good night that was
such a stupid joke too
"what's gimli's grandfather's name"
"poop ballsack"
none of us even laughed at it at first, it just kind of snowballed through the night
a perfect magic
i totally forgot to bring an octagon
who wants to play a quick round of age of empires II
can't you just send me a list
fucking dumee
well sure
i don't know what half of these are
tm or woc would probably be better equipped to answer your question

let it lie, it sucks that she's talking this way to fans but it's not really relevant to homestuck 2 and it doesn't do much good to talk about it
a ship traveling at a lesser velocity would necessarily have an orbit that's further away from the parent body
so, the thing that happened in minneapolis where it turned out that a lot of the rioters that got arrested were actually out of state people that belonged to far right extremist groups?
that's happening in KC too
increasingly seems like a coordinated effort to create bad blood between protestors and cops all over the country
the fuck?
where did you guys hear this
you say that but i didn't hear any of that shit
just give me an article so i can read about it
wow, that's fucking crazy
also thanks for the info
it's just strange
KCMO hasn't had any riots since 1968
and then they sprung up tonight, turned violent, and have continued since 10 PM
pretty atypical here, but i guess there's a first for everything
yeah, ferguson is a really specific suburb of st. louis
i watched those livestreams in real time, it didn't extend beyond that town
the fact that these protests/riots are happening at this scale in so many places is unprecedented
sksksksksks
CHINA!
why are the russians smug exactly
i was going to say, i'd figure that was the more important part
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
guess i should have seen that coming
kind of sad how people will take advantage of _anything_ to make a quick buck
yeah, it's a pretty strange brand of illogic
explain your logic then
this seems pretty straightforward to me, but if you've caught some sort of snag i'd like to hear it
that's not a question of statistics, that's a question of underlying factors
if you have a large enough sample size at work and you see this clear relationship among most of them where "higher diversity" leads to "lower unionization" then that's... still pretty demonstrative of something
the underlying factors might differ between stores to some degree but the fact remains that a relationship of some kind exists
because i just don't give that much of a shit about fringe alright
does someone have the actual article so we can read it
```The stores' individual risk scores are calculated from more than two dozen metrics, including employee "loyalty," turnover, and racial diversity [...]

Store-risk metrics include average store compensation, average total store sales, and a "diversity index" that represents the racial and ethnic diversity of every store. Stores at higher risk of unionizing have lower diversity and lower employee compensation, as well as higher total store sales and higher rates of workers' compensation claims, according to the documents.```
yeah, even just looking at this website's _name_ i would be highly skeptical of what's being said here
and especially given this piece of wording? ```This should give you a clue as to why our Woke Capitalist rulers are so eager to preach the mantra of "diversity."```
this just reeks of someone with bias to prove
HOWEVER
let me read the bu--yeah
i'm reading it now
```Whole Foods' heat map says lower rates of racial diversity increase unionization risks``` appears to be a main point
makin, i seriously don't care alright
i have it up and i'm listening but i'm not going to actively watch the show unless i want to
go back to gene the cow squirting milk directly from its teat into walter's gently quivering mouth
that's not what clickbait means
if you're still talking about the first article that was linked in here, we moved on from that and are looking at the business insider article instead
which uses far less biased wording
if you guys don't stop bitching about me actively watching fringe, i'll ban your asses
get the fuck outta here

this is your last chance motherfucker
also yes gitax i was trying to respond to you but i kept getting interrupted by a rude piece of shit
i agree that i would prefer to have access to the hard numbers behind all this, but unless they somehow link to it in this article, that's literally not going to happen
as it is, i don't think this is as big of a deal as you're making it seem
let me go back and remember exactly what spurred this discussion
i think you were complaining about it being statistically inaccurate
but there's nothing to suggest what the statistics actually are, so i don't know how you could really posit that
i think it's more or less reasonable to take the information "stores that have higher diversity appear to be at lower risk of unionization" in the same way that we take most pieces of information from news sources
technically i agree with you that the framing is a bit sensational
but the underlying information is what's being disputed here, not the actualy quality of the writing
Cringe.
holy shit gnawms, that one's good
something about it made me laugh
alright gnawms, we get it
chill out with the riot footage
<:annoyedpepe:309825259820023809>

is anyone else just insanely confused by the bulk of the exposition in this update
there's stuff to meme visually
the dutton monster or whatever it was
this update is mildly bewildering


is this like... weird, subtle meta commentary?

christ on a cracker
fucking christ
i hate my glasses getting fogged up through facemask
absolutely miserable
get fucked idiot
but in seriousness, i think that tensions are running kind of high with this stuff
not in here necessarily, but i'm kind of leaning towards keeping people from getting too heated about it
teasing cops with a donut on a fishing pole sounds funny but we don't really need it in here i think
i don't know, it's a complex issue that deserves a lot of consideration
we definitely don't want to just ban discussion of it either, which would suck
rip cheese rolling
were it so easy
what in the fuck is this conversation
straight up raw anger probably isn't going to help
focused, directed anger? that's a different story
i approve of anger that's applied in useful and effective ways
<@!184545248930693120> going pure ape shitt is bad, go tactical apeshit
if all you can do when you're angry is be a directionless wiener then it doesn't actually help
look
i'm playing gears of war 2 right now or i would offer some more in depth explanation of how i feel about this stuff
the riots are a lot of food for thought
ss13 _is_ fun
but it's not the hero we deserve right now
man what the fuck
i think there's some kind of burglary alarm that went off because i was in the living room
it scared the shit out of me and i decided to recede into my bedroom cuz of it
fuck this cra
there we go, just managed to catch up on stats
the 1st of each month, in addition to normal discord stuff i also go and record the traffic by day for the subreddit for the last month
patterns were typical for may, decent spikes for updates
but not as much as in the past
i think people are starting to get fed up with this shit
is there any possible way to figure out the traffic for homestuck 2 or is that information only the website owners can release
unfortunately it doesn't provide anything in terms of absolute numbers
this is just relative search interest as far as i can tell
why is google trends so shit
mastodon is obscure
it's indisputable that twitter is a festering shitmire
but they at least had some semblance of visibility and fan interaction on it
mastodon basically makes the creator obfuscation even worse than it already was
if their goal is to reach their audience then this is actually making that harder
if their goal isn't to reach their audience then what the fuck _is_ their goal
i could offer a few guesses, but nothing that other people haven't already said
what
the fuck is tankie fallacy
homestuck 2 itself isn't worth being mad over anymore
i think i even said that earlier today
but the way the current creators treat their audience is fucking despicable
derision and then scathing pettiness when they aren't completely receptive
i'd place a bet on whether homestuck 2 will survive to the end of the year or not, but i don't think that'd be very polite since i'm the server owner
gotta maintain at least a facade of support, i _guess_
it's not about them liking me, it's about not making things worse than they already are
my actions could directly/indirectly affect the people who this place and the subreddit, so i feel like i need to be more mindful of how i act
man, the last time the official team got pissed off at us they started to accuse our community of being a pedophile ring and harboring child abusers
i don't want those sorts of accusations being lobbed at us again
hm
i guess you're right actually
i guess gnawms' point is, what does it matter at this point
like, what would be the realistic, practical effect on us as a result of those things
well, on a purely practical level, hussie and the official team know my real name
i'm sure if they were vindictive enough they could try to pursue something like trashing my real life or even a lawsuit
other than that basically nothing of actual consequence is possible
the actual legitimacy of a lawsuit is not in question here, i'm sure if they wanted they could dredge up anything just to make life worse for people
bah
i have a lot to think about
but even accepting all this, i'd like to keep from becoming openly hostile again
no, it was just an unfortunate circumstance with my email
as has been stated, it probably won't amount to much in the end
i'm still not really on board with giving out all of the information i have simply because i don't want to burn ALL of our bridges
i mean
okay, look at it this way
at its heart we still want homestuck as a property to be successful _somehow,_ don't we
when we offer criticism it's not to be spiteful, it's because we're disappointed that homestuck isn't going well and want to offer advice on how it can do better
releasing the information we have would basically accomplish the opposite of that and i don't really feel okay with it
if i ever become convinced that it would be totally pointless then sure, i'd say something
otherwise whatever
watch me, bitch
we have machines for that now
homestuck 2 is basically a dumpster fire, there's no sense of cohesion to it at all
it doesn't pay respect to the original material OR its fans, it has no solid direction, the writing is a mess
the only thing that's consistently good about homestuck 2 so far is the art, and that's hamstrung by this absurd refusal to do flash animation of any kind and the prattles
gnawms, these comments aren't out of the ordinary
i'm perfectly willing to dispense stuff like this whenever
i'm talking about genuinely harmful shit outside of the context of the comic itself
yes, basically tm
gnawms, i think you're conflating the two things
shitting on the comic for being bad = completely fair game
shitting on people for reasons that are private = arguably unethical territory
i never said that the private reasons affect the comic
everything i've said about the people involved and how they affect the comic are completely public things
aside from what gets deleted i guess
what happened in private doesn't really change that the creators are doing enough damage to irrevocably fuck up the comic
snatch that WEAVE
holy shit, really
i mean, abiguously?
the portrait really isn't that strong, i can't see it personally
also, i'm kind of torn on the flag burning
i think that it's an extremely strong statement against the cultural institutions that have been in place for a while that should have been dismantled a while ago
i feel like in the short term it's a valuable sign of the times
in the long term though, it's the loss of a significant piece of history
why on earth does virginia want the flag back so bad
well, who knows, now that it's unilaterally a democrat-based governance
i think they're going to try and issue legislation to reverse that stuff
but i might be wrong, i'm outta there now so it doesn't concern me
<:howhigh:339608981582512128>
"fuck12" refers to the narcotics section of police forces
i guess the thing is that we talk here in really abstract terms, at least vaguely divorced from reality
then when it comes to real life, people just Do Shit
the philosophical and ethical ramifications don't really matter much when you've got people who have a goal and are willing to complete it at risk of all else
the meaning of burning a confederate flag from the civil war doesn't really factor in if your goal is to demonstrate irreverence to that piece of history
oof
oh, what has biden said about all the protesting
i might have missed it
yeah, i think the point i'm getting at is that when it comes down to it, you're not going to be keeping most of that stuff in mind probably
actually thinking and conjecturing about these things is far different from being in a situation where you're acting in real time
i don't know how useful it is, to be honest
i guess it's conditional on what precisely is taking place
like the discussion of historical objects is directly relevant for obvious reasons
bah
it's hard to be alive
philosophy is only fun until you start going in circles, and then it makes me want to murder

it's not because tensions are already high and i don't want this server to become yet another battleground to fight with each other about this stuff

<@!205026834205769748> <@!168980988477702145> and whoever else was involved in that
holy shit, is that actually ohp
did he get beaned from twitter
that's probably for the best to be honest
his writing is interesting, but more in a morbid sense than anything else
the less people get exposed to ideas like that, the better
i'm sure makin has a mirror
if not, then it probably gets removed
fuck is a HCMC
pronounced "hhk-mhk"
no, fuck that
we're all probably going to die in one night
ü¶Ä rick and morty is dead ü¶Ä
ü¶Ä god-shaped hole and possibly 0hp are dead ü¶Ä
it just fucking sucks now
not like how people used to complain about rick and morty sucking, which it typically didn't
but like it genuinely sucks now
no, you guys are just contrarian twits
rick and morty wasn't earth-shattering but there was genuine appeal to it
anyone who suggests otherwise deserves death
i do agree that xra is better though
the minecraft server we were using apparently got deactivated at some point
come on fluctis, get your shit together
no idea when it'll go back up
we'll just have to see
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
never
as soon as the server is back up i'll share an IP address in here

hardcore minecraft, just to see how far we get
at this rate we just might never get to it
fluctis is being weird, so for now just go on with your night
i'll let you guys know if anything changes

it's a theory that makin swears by, where the quality of users increases the further down you get on the channel list due to people having to look further and getting caught in the upper channels
i don't really subscribe to that idea but i guess it works at least _somewhat_

if he can withstand that sort of response and bounce back from it, then he's to be commended
almost like handling criticism, due or undue, and being charismatic is a more effective way of handling your audience
hm
trump saying he'll deploy the military in states that don't quell protesting
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
historically i've opposed gun ownership but i think i might purchase one, this is getting completely out of control
what exactly is my reasoning here
because the way you phrased it makes it sound like i was planning to go fucking rambo against the united states military
are you a fucking simpleton
owning a gun is primarily about being able to defend your own home
it's not about going out and executing people or into some kind of warzone
i'm not planning on going out to fight people
i'm concerned about the possibility of people trying to break into the house or assault my family at this point
if violence escalates enough and overflows into the suburbs, things are going to get really, really bad
you're thinking about this from the entirely wrong angle
yes, i'm less than half an hour away from kansas city
i have no idea what things will look like if the military is actually called into the area
yes, dipshit
if things actually somehow turn into a warzone (i don't actually believe it'll get that bad) i have family out in the country i can probably go to
like, deep country, unlikely to be affected by this
the fact that i'm even remotely considering this as a possibility should be cause for concern
\7
i don't think it'll actually become like i'm suggesting
but as crazy as things have gotten already, i'm not about to rely on optimism
carlarc, are you intent on being like this
usually it's just funny but you're actually being an asshole here
people have already died
yeah, i know
i'm trying to tell you that this is quickly approaching very serious
try to tone it down if all you're doing is taking the piss
like the dirty piss drinker you are
yeah, i know
i'm just worried
wh
i already moved
i am in my current home for the next month at least

corpulent siberian canine
while we're on the topic of gaming
ü§î
<@!207991389613457408> i'm pleased to say that about 98% of gears of war 1 holds up very well, but conversely, most of gears of war 2 has aged really, really badly
the entire sideplot with dom's wife has no lasting impact until the next game, the design of a lot of places is nonsensical (special offender: queen's palace with the LONG STRETCH where there's random pieces of floor that can be put away or brought back), tonal whiplash, 'member berries
it's kind of a mess to be honest
there are some parts that are genuinely entertaining like cole screaming into the microphone, but it would be better if there wasn't that tonal disconnect, where dom not 15 minutes prior had to put down his fucking wife
his lobotomized wife no less
also yes, i was going to say that while the story is really ass on replay, the gameplay has held up pretty well
the main thing i complain about is stuff that was also present in gears 1, where hitboxes can be funky
especially with sniper rifles, there's a large chunk of drones' backs where shots literally just glide through and cause no damage
but then if you hit it just right it's a headshot?
it makes no sense and they coded it poorly
i'm hoping that gears of war 3 is better than i remember
i'll keep you poste
"bladder cancer signs may be infuriatingly subtle" as this man is bent over from the sheer force of his lower abdominal pain
he cannot contain his screaming
one weird thing i will say about the gameplay in particular is that, while the small-scale individual battles are mostly well-crafted apart from some weird arenas, the large-scale battles where you're killing hundreds of locust in a given fight often feel weird and sloppy
also lots of inconsistency in how tough given enemies are, which is kind of necessary from a gameplay standpoint i guess if you're doing something really fast-paced
but it feels weird to pump like seven thousand rounds into a normal enemy and then it gets chunked by two rounds in a different scenario
let me see here
two year development period after the first game released
that seems a bit on the short side but i can't remember what it was like for that kind of thing back then
for two years i guess they did add a lot of stuff to this game and tightened up the graphics significantly, it's just the plot and some design elements that feel rushed
nights has never really spoken up about hsd except in a personal way, to say "it's not really for me, that kind of environment makes me feel anxious"

anyway i haven't checked the minecraft server today, i just got back from traipsing around overland park
being the most popular girl in school
i think the server might be borked
i'll have to fix it tomorrow
for now i just want to chill and play gears of war 3
i'm on a fucking KICK
fine, let me check the website and see if there's anything i can do
are you done
anyway, do we want to keep pvp on for some god forsaken reason or will this be a pve hardcore server

much better
oh, that outline is much more noticeable on dark mode
fix it yourself
i was going to say, what the fuck does he _say_ about tulpae
i don't think so, personally
you tend to go a bit too far when you make fun of shit, but at the same time you've _always_ made it clear that you're just making fun and don't actually believe people are stupid or whatever
i think a simple apology and a promise not to do it again is completely sufficient
flag on the play: the clown was due to multivac blocking carlarc, had nothing to do with the original topic of altercation
the altercation and the block are two separate things
you can respect someone's opinion and then make fun of them for overreacting when their opinion is criticized
i would probably do the same thing to be completely honest, i think blocking is an immature and stunted way of dealing with problems
but that's just me
if you have someone that's legitimately abusing other people then blocking is not really the option you should be pursuing
also that
carlarc literally apologized twice
you fucking wiener <:howHigh:533447620417290240>
this is why you don't block people to begin with, it makes these sorts of reconciliations HARDER
anyway, mines that's not what i said
if someone is abusing you or someone else, then you should probably be taking more direct action
i just feel like blocking users on discord falls into this weird middle ground where either the offending instances are too petty to really complain over or too grievous to keep the offender around
<:gametez:585539446724624385>
so we all agree
blocking is the gambit of fools and cowards
cy, woc has had an extremely bad influence on you
no mothfucking
anyway, with regard to nat
i don't know, she's really grown on me
i used to despise how she did things and talked to people
i guess in a way i still do, but she just doesn't really do that anymore
at least not from what i've seen
also i agree mines, i want to ban the wig emote whenever i see it
i think i might have to start punishing people who react with Wig! or brapposting
starting with multivac
you can't achieve victory if you're dead
carl, i actually used to get a sizeable number of complaints about nat's behavior
i kept yelling at her and she's mostly stopped, if not totally
she's a loose cannon, but she's a damn good cop
unironically
<@!195290352838508544> that's because the situation is more complicated than "a user messages me and i instantly act on what they say"
nat fills a gap in the mod team that no one else really can or does, and she's constantly maintaining arquiusbot alongside woc
and as i said, she's toned down significantly over the years
between these two things and the subsequent lessening number of complaints, i'm basically unwilling to remove her from the team
what are you talking about
they're going to be making a brap simulator
yeah, i know
i felt bad as soon as i hit enter

<@!184545248930693120> i think there's two things to point out in your case
first is that you've been exposed to people saying it's the best shit ever for years now
so your expectations were a bit high
second, it's the most quotable YTP in existence
slightly ahead of hank of the hill and its derivatives
that was quotably quoted, friend
quouotably quouoted
bootlicking is a pejorative indicating someone who subscribes to the idea that "might makes right," or who believes the state/authority is always right no matter what
people are getting heated and throwing shit around with little reason
or they're being morons
take your pick
you deserve death
ifnar, stop
no, she works for the state
anyway, she and i were talking about this stuff today
she and i are both against looting specifically
i brought up the idea that avoiding destruction of mom and pop stores should be sufficient,, and that looting big chains like walmart shouldn't be that bad
but she explained that even if you only loot from large corporations, they usually find a way to pass on losses to their employees and avoid losing much money themselves
this stuff is really complicated
i think a lot of the people who toss around terms like "bootlicker" are just supremely angry about this stuff (as they probably should be) but they don't know how to vent it effectively
i'm sure if people put their heads together they could find really inventive, efficient ways to be civilly disobedient
because i think a fundamental assumption about all this is that "things as they currently stand cannot be allowed to continue"
i agree with this completely, the normalization of wanton violence and fostering of this "us vs them" mentality is unacceptable and will only get worse
peaceful protests only work with a sufficiently large number of people, but violent protesting actually turns the larger populace against you
it's the same kind of problem that guerilla insurgencies face
i would also agree that looting is an inevitable side effect of the protests due to opportunists
those are the people who really need to be discriminated against
less lethal, not non-lethal
get it right cy
it does, but the entire point of these protests is that the police are either maximally protected against recourse, or they ignore their boundaries anyway
it's against regulations and the law for a police officer to kneel on someone's throat and asphyxiate them, but that's the incident that sparked these protests
there are similar and even more brutal acts that happen all the time in the US
no you dumb tankie wiener
it's not even seizing the means of distribution
a grocery store isn't some kind of transport
it's the end-point for delivery
you people need to get your fucking guerilla-related terminology straight
ifnar, we've been over this
suffering elsewhere, greater or lesser, doesn't preclude the existence of suffering for people here
not really
suffering's relevance comes mostly from personal association
not really the scale of it
unless you're talking about an unbelievably huge scale
i don't really get your point to be honest
like, the event that sparked these protests is the outright murder of a black guy in minneapolis that got recorded on camera in front of a huge crowd
people see these events all the time in america and hate it, but this was so over the line that people finally said "fuck it, i'm done tolerating this"
no, that's kind of dumb ifnar
this is a very real problem
i don't know how to explain to you that aggressively violent police officers who discriminately maim and even kill members of the populace are an issue that needs to be addressed swiftly and effectively
it's not just one death dude
america is a big place and, as i said, this happens very frequently
what do you want these protestors to do, schedule flights to kenya and start planting trees/handing out food?
they're too busy getting shot at by the police
yeah, that's kind of lunatic phrasing
i don't know that you could get much worse than what trump was or was not doing anyway
it's not like he has a plan to assist with the coronavirus, and was arguably making it worse by stealing medical supplies being shipped to hospitals
at this point distracting trump from dealing with the coronavirus has like no net impact on the situation whatsoever
ifnar, i'm not sure if you're trolling or being serious
if you're being serious then i think you're working with like almost no actual information
that's a really surface level suggestion that sounds reasonable but runs into a lot of systemic problems
like the establishment of police clique-esque culture where people who try to upset the balance of what's already there get driven out
people aren't morons who haven't thought of this stuff
the point of the protests is that there are a lot of problems on a huge, systemic level
trying to address them in traditional ways has yielded no results or made things worse
people are pissed off and trying to instill change by expressing how angry they are that the system has failed them
multivac are you just tossing out random bullshit at this point
explain what you mean or perish
that was complete nonsense
fuck this conversation, it was turned into shit by people who know even less about what's going on than i do
<@!164754076293267457> asking me for data on this is kind of bizarre
like, it's a reasonable thing to do, but it's like asking me for data on the fact that photosynthesis is a thing that happens in plants
it's not something that i can just whip up data for you, it's an observed, well-established phenomenon
because it's not a hypothetical scenario
police forces tend to accumulate an endemic culture that leads to members of the force protecting each other and ousting anyone who would rock the boat
that's a thing that happens, i don't know what else to tell you
do you actually understand how a police force works
sure, append "in the US" to everything
stop being a dumb pedant
deal with it
anyway, the reason i say that is because police forces don't have tens of thousands of people
unless you mean like, across the country, as a generalized movement
in which case your suggestion amounts to nothing
in what way would tens of thousands of people applying to the police help
that's not a given, and also kind of relies on the assumption that there are tens of thousands of people who 1) are willing to apply in the first place and 2) would be good at being a police officer
what i'm trying to say is that your suggestion isn't really practical or even feasible
little vetting being done isn't something that would be fixed by having tens of thousands of also unvetted, unqualified people being hired onto the force
because there's a real chance that once in the system, they would undergo the kind of cultural assimilation that people joining the police already experience
the most probable way to fix this problem would be to have like a proper police academy and certification, as governed by an independent body that works on more universal qualifications
right now there isn't any such thing
major police groups like in big cities kind of have this but they all have different standards
that's not even to get into places with less than 50,000 people
i think most people have this misconception that The Police in any given place consists of a large number of individuals
my hometown and several others in the area have _one_ cop for the entire city, and then the sheriff
who serves the entire county
a sizeable part of the problem is funding, and a lot of the rest of the problem comes from lack of oversight
my significant other has worked for the highway patrol for years now, i've picked up a lot of stuff by osmosis
i guess what it boils down to, as it often does, is that people don't know shit
that being said, i think that the fundamental idea behind these protests still stands: the system we have now *in the US does not function properly and needs to be retooled, if not changed entirely
disregarding any of this dumb bullshit like "what about other places in the world that suffer more" or hackneyed suggestions that wouldn't really accomplish anything
this is why my primary concern is directing anger and activity in effective ways
if things need to change, you don't waste your time or energy on dumb bullshit that won't help
i can dismiss it, because it's not relevant to what's happening right here and now
the suffering of people in other places of the world is really abstract and kind of distanced to anyone who doesn't live where or when it's happening
okay, then let me phrase it this way
i'll set up a hypothetical situation
in this situation, there's two problems happening at the same time
one of those problems is happening locally, and i don't have to travel to it, i understand what's happening better because i'm aware of the area and the things in it
the other problem is worse but happening a hundred miles away from me
from a strictly utilitarian perspective, it would arguably make sense to drop your local issue to go help with the bigger one
but realistically that approach runs into a lot of problems
such as the potential to actually make things worse because you don't know what the fuck you're doing
<@!195290352838508544> you need to fucking knock it off with these stupid gotchas
man, what was that quote i saw recently
no
but i can
is only conversation
no, it's not fun reading your capital letters bolded and italicized
don't do it again
responding to the actual content of it, tm i think that idea is kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy
systemic change can't come except as the result of marginal efforts all pooled together
each person adding their effort to the pile is what causes larger changes to happen
just saying "your individual effort won't change anything" is kind of a dumb argument against participating in stuff you think is important
why would i vote third party and split the vote in favor of trump
that seems really, really stupid even just from a utilitarian perspective
you want me to make it easier for a demagogue who has inarguably made things worse for everyone to retain his power? are you evil?
man, where the fuck is this "i don't care" coming from
it's not that i don't care
it's that this other thing is more immediately pressing from a personal perspective
"there are real problems happening at home" does not strictly equal "other problems don't exist"
it's a matter of reaching to what's nearby and trying to take care of yourself first if you can
you ever heard of the idea of making sure you're capable of taking care of yourself before trying to take care of others
"a world without americans would be far better"
"oh so you're pro genocide"
LITERALLY ONE AFTER THE OTHER
tm, i don't think anyone here said we should never address those other problems at some point
you manufactured this conclusion from nowhere
but you just fucking said that you don't think we shouldn't take care of ourselves first
how are we supposed to take care of ourselves first and then someone else simultaneously
do you have fucking poo brain
YES
THAT'S WHAT I JUST FUCKING SAID
oh, i see what the problem is
you're operating on the assumption that problems abroad are inherently more deserving of attention than the issues we face here
i don't see the point in this distinction
<@!131892666714685442> if all you're going to do is take potshots and post low-effort memes from the sidelines, go to altgen and stay out of here
this is your only warning
i think people who argue from utilitarian perspectives have trouble grasping the reality of the situation
you need to sprinkle some pragmatism into your thoughts
yeah, we get it
the problem is that there's little means to agree or disagree on what's most effective
you're making this statement that makes sense on paper but in reality is extremely difficult to assess and act on
that's why i'm asking you to utilize some pragmatism you fucking wiener
i'm pretty sure that was as joke
good lord, this is a mess
if you type in all caps again you're getting temp banned
reducing the protesting to "masked looters" is disingenuous
stop with that nonsense
i did
i just find the joke aggravating i guess
whatever, i should have been asleep hours ago
active lit is best lit though

wow, backlog was fucking wild
<@!251246395887976449> it's always a treat when you show up to keymash
i personally didn't care about the content warnings in the first place, i feel like they can have deleterious effects on literature for reasons that are too complicated for me to express without taking a while to hash it out properly
however
the fact that they had them and then got rid of them is extremely bizarre
i've heard that this is only temporary while they work on the website, but i don't see why that would necessitate removing the cws
and if we're speaking in the ideal case, i think that having them behind a spoiler block actually makes the most sense for the kind of audience they were trying to reach
so the fact that they're just gone is... it's just weird, i don't understand it
maybe? it might just be a rumor
can't trust people on the internet
kate continually damaging homestuck's reputation by mere association is not a surprise to me though, and i echo sentiments that she's a self-centered person and that's why she responds so fucking poorly to people
poogers
it's not really wack, in the sense that's it totally expected behavior at this point
i would be more surprised and weirded out if we were talking about basically anyone else
unfortunately, we're technically a homestuck server, so really we have no choice but to announce updates when they happen
i guess we could just... not do that
i'm not actually considering this you fucking nonces
shut u
i'm just thinking out loud
oh wow, you're actually right
i thought it was a less inflammatory insult than that
well THAT'S OUT THE WINDOW
yeah, but that doesn't make sense as an insult
anyway
unfortunately we're intrinsically shackled to homestuck and its affiliated properties
i mean, i still love homestuck in that i want it to succeed
it's just the kind of sad love that you have for a relative who started doing drugs and landed in the county lockup
all you can do is tell them you want them to clean up their act
and that you'll be there for them when they get their shit together

there are multiple video files that have been pinned, and i always include a link to that specific post so people can go download and watch it themselves
because you can't upload videos to imgur you fucking idiot
yes, i was also going to say that in recent posts i've started including direct download links instead of just linkging to the post
so tahnks for the reminder to do that for that post anyway

minecraft hardcore server
we're all going in at the same time and seeing how far we can get
i think we need to have a cut off though
because there's always going to be that last person who's just stupid good at minecraft and will probably be able to solidly avoid dying until ender dragon
so i imagine that if it gets down to... one? person then we should call it a failure
and then reconvene tomorrow to restart
actually you know what that's a good idea
the last person will be considered the Victor and will have won minecraft for the evening
yeah, we'll wait then
no pvp
pve only
i think there's an option for that isn't there
but actually
accidents are fine
if someone accidentally kills someone else, then the offender is also sentenced to death
just to spice things up
hm
may be
as soon as tm gets here

generally, making anyone's first experience with anything be a mod is a bad idea
if they don't like the vanilla experience then mods aren't for them
just have people play the original
what's going on that's making you so upset, if i can ask
if you'd prefer to keep that to yourself that's fine too
well, if that's the case then that's fine
in the future though, just use common sense
also i know, but it's weird because that message was sent by nights on her old account, which is now deleted
fair enough interro, i feel that
ot
whoops
what was i even going to say
i guess it's weird because in the iliad proper, i don't know that it's ever said that achilles is actually invincible except for his heel
he has a full set of armor crafted for him by hephaestus
what would an invincible dude need with a set of armor
most of achilles' reputation is for his exceptional strength and skill in killing people
like he's a straight up monster
.... yes actually
shut up nerd
+progress
<@!205026834205769748> yeah i've been thinking a lot about how to make the server a more interesting experience for all involved
i think i want to craft some kind of rule list and/or turn the hardcore server into a challenge?
because i feel like we have a sharp divide between people who are really familiar with minecraft and aren't actually all that likely to die, except in outstanding circumstances, and then you have the complete noobs
so let's brainstorm in a bit to find a way to balance stuff out and make things more interesting
it... does
it has to do with population ratios
like
the usa has a Total Population
and then it has subpopulations for each race
the Total Number of White People versus Total Number of Latin Americans versus Total Number of Black People
what that graph is describing is that the ratio of black people that are getting killed is higher than the ratio of white people
i guess i can see why it's confusing, but i'll explain it a different way
shut the fuck up
i will kill you with my bare hands
i know, i'm just not focusing on that argument right now because i want to help andrew understand what the fuck is going on
let me describe it this way
the total population of the united states is around 330 million or so last i checked
the total number of white people is about 234 million, or 73% of the population
the total number of black people is about 40.5 million, or 12.7%
if the rate of death by police brutality were proportional across those percentages, you'd expect to see roughly the same deaths per 10 million people, right
so if the total US death by police rate is 28 per 10 million
then you'd expect to see 28 per 10 million both with white people and black people
but this graph is saying that latin americans (whatever) and black people are experiencing a higher rate of death than white people, and are both in fact over the national average
which means they're being targeted
do you understand
then what exactly are you asking here
the overall bar IS the average
well
i actually just did the math and the average of those three numbers is actually 33.5
but like
this doesn't account for asian people or native americans, or any other ethnicities
so i'm sure that there's information on the backend we're not seeing here
the number is close enough for that justification
i think spiral is trying to say that the point you're making doesn't really add to the overall conversation of the problem, or even just serves to muddy the waters
i wouldn't agree that it's entirely pointless or obfuscating, it's another angle from which to consider stuff
but i _would_ agree that it doesn't have much impact on the big picture
hwo is it poignant
no, i'm literally asking how this discussion and/or your point is poignant
that's not what poignant means

IDIOT
CHARLATAN
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i'm wiggling my hand in midair
like, sure
everything factors into the big picture
i just cast doubt on how this particular thing factors into this whole deal we're seeing right now with the protests
i guess you could say it matters in the sense that the protests are framed largely around Black Lives being killed by the police
but i think that there's an underlying tone of "everyone is sick of this too"
it feels like it's been a while since i saw the word "brainlet"

the most common bread choices in america are white bread or wheat bread, like if you'r getting sandwiches or something
strictly speaking we don't call it "sweetbread"
i'm sure we have something called sweetbread that the rest of the world would find absolutely monstrously sweet
apparently "sweetbread" is also the name of the throat or pancreas of animals like cows, pigs, and sheep
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetbread
i've never enjyoed jelly, peanut butter sandwiches all the way
actually reminds me that i had a dream where i was eating peanut butter by the scoop
enormous globs of chunky peanut butter going straight into my mouth

it made me think of the time that we watched king of the hill together and i really miss that sort of feeling

most prominent is just pinching and removing the flowers so that the tree will produce less fruit, but those fruit will have more nutrients going into them so they'll be much bigger and juicier
practically mandatory practice in the apple industry

CATS
FUCKING CHRIST
the kitten just scratched the SHIT out of my arm
that is enough cat for one day
the orange one, yes
my arm fucking itches now
this is why i don't have pets myself
fuck this crap
i'm fucked i guess
yes, i'll take a picture


look at that smug asshole
it is, yeah

fuck this stupid fucking cat right in his cute fucking face
i can't sleep anywhere BUT my side
it's because i'm fat, i feel like i'm suffocating if i sleep on my chest or back
the few times i've managed to fall asleep on my back, i end up waking up halfway through the night gasping for air because suddenly it feels like i can't breathe
hashtag sleep apnea life
i need constant whitenoise or i can't fall asleep
ree
nothing
i'm just here
carlarc never got back to me about stuff
so minecraft is kind of in stasis for the moment
also god DAMN i hat e/r/unpopularopinion
this cold is so take it's singlehandedly re-freezing the poles
i also thoguht you were referring to real life shit
"most of my near deaths were from caving"
like, how often do you go spelunking
they're plenty threatening i think
between zombies, skeletons, and creepers (and silverfish) you can pretty effectively have your hands full trying to watch out for any or all of them
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmj////////////jjj/';//
an excellent question
also i just finished gears of war 3
i guess to mollify woc i'll go describe my feelings on it in gaming
shuttup bitch
gears of war 3 felt really, really, really weirdly balanced
at many points i wasn't sure if it was poorly designed or what
the down and revive system is dramatically different since NPCs can revive you instead of just instadying if you got downed in single player
and i think that they intentionally designed the game around that, because there are portions where you're faced with a frankly overwhelming number of enemies and it feels impossible NOT to get downed
other than that, there's this weird interplay where the total amount of ammo you can hold for some guns is heavily reduced, but then some enemies become bullet sponges, so economizing is actually quite difficult
the sniper rifle also joins the ranks of guns whose ammo cannot be found in ammo boxes
so that was intensely frustrating
overall i think that it's aged better than 2 though
the story felt more cohesive and they definitely, DEFINITELY did not have the same shitty writing quality
no 'member berries, no tonal whiplash
it was honestly somewhat of a return to gears of war 1 in the sense of tone, where it's a small group of people trying desperately to keep their heads above water as they rush to accomplish a task
it's not as tight as gears of war 1 but it's always hard to match an original
time for gears 4 tomorrow
you wish, baby
i've actually never played gears 4 so it doesn't count as spinning my wheels
remember: you're here forever
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
indubitably
yes
i didn't enjoy it super much but it was still an above average movie
how do you figure that
vac that doesn't track
ever17 is something only makin likes
baby driver is something that only makin dislikes
no, there isn't a material need for an _alternative_
there's a material need for improvement
big difference
abolishing the police in their entirety is a fucking terrible idea, no offense
what we should do is xamine places whose police forces are much better than hours and take the elements that improve theirs
fine, adapt
no, it's not
the requirements to become a policeman are extremely bad
what is it tera
uh, okay
i think having the means to defend yourself _without proper training_ makes you more violence
see: the castle doctrine
but people who have a healthy respect for their methods of self-defense probably aren't anymore violent
police academy?
criminal justice/criminology?
lethal pig bellies
assyria
that picture is from like 4 years ago
okay, i'm fucking serious
literal shit posting is now a bannable offense for at least the next 24 hours
probably longer actually
i'm tired of seeing it
you people push my buttons
<@!125433170047795200> program an arquius function i can turn on that uses a list of words that all have to do with poop and it temp bans anyone who uses those words
just like star wars
scrolling through like half an hour of shit jokes and people talking about taking shits
it's enough to make me want to murder
alright, carlarc is the first casualty

lmao
<:feelsLinkyMan:684981387094261843>
<@!257144766901256192> you asked me for a civ, you didn't ask me how to play it
figure it out yourself dummy
i wonder why it does that
ah, i'm sure i've done that at least once
makes sense
if it's civ V? i like babylon a lot for science and military victories
pre-DLC i prefer egypt for cultural victories, post DLC i prefer brazil
i don't really do diplomacy victories, except one time where i paid literally no attention to any city-state the entire game while saving up a shit ton of cash, then paid all of them to be allied with me literally the turn before the UN voted
diplomatic victories are fucking stupid
at least against AI, maybe it's more complex with human players
if we're talking about civ VI, i don't have a favorite civilization yet and might never have one
i don't think i enjoy the game too much
there are way too few civs in 6 that actually have science buffs?
in my opinion?
i kind of hate it, unless science victories no longer work the way i think they do
Flimsy **Traitor**

yeah, the aesthetic is great and all but they should really have the name in plaintext alongside it or something
god, what reality does this person live in
but the question is, ~~who is the question~~ what is the answer?
<@!207991389613457408> man i don't know what the fuck you were talking about
i'm glad i decided to give gears 4 a try, because while i didn't quite love it, it was a pretty enjoyable experience
overall criticism i have is that it felt like an hour's worth of gameplay stretched out too far
like, this could probably have stood to be shrunk down and then released as DLC for a larger game
but most of the components within it i actually felt were pretty decent
i'm about as attached to the new characters as much as i was with delta squad by the end of gears 1
so in short: fuck you duderino you're just a WIENER
it's been a rather active day, all things considered
i guess it's just that a lot more stuff has been going on irl
i keep reading news stories about protest stuff and police brutality and it makes me upset
i was going to say, that sounds like a foreign thing
there are two states of being: american or foreign
go back to your country internet, fool
ah
hm
why _are_ there so many brazilians
yeah, plenty of times
usually after updates, so we can express confusion and disappointment
oh
well there's two problems with that
homestuck has been over for over 4 years now
you run out of shit to talk about with the original unless you get some new blood in the mix and can reshare opinions without it feeling tired
conversely, homestuck 2 sucks, but it's all the new content we're getting for the foreseeable future
we're kind of forced to talk about it
this server is like a sandwich
generalized discussion across the entire server serve as like a really, really nice bread
it's not perfect but overall it's pretty great
homestuck 2 is the filling of the sandwich, and it is fucking rotten to the core
but without it, we wouldn't be a sandwich
üî™
well now things are awkward for everybody
let's have a distraction, shall we
animal crossing is a very relaxing game to play
every aspect of its design is meant to make you take some time and chill out
there's value in that
you can totally go do that
why do you feel the need to be such a vociferous dick about
he must be kept anonymous to protect his identity
he's in witness protection
<a:ahowSmushing:402938349259718666>
this is the best shit
that's okay, think it out
<@!155401695138938881> where did you see that
is it something they're planning on doing or is it being done quietly with no announcemen
i have all 636 videos downloaded on my desktop computer
they're safe
yeah, i foresaw this exact shit happening years ago
it's probably them covering their ass given jontron's comments
not recent comments, but just the initial controversy
i imagine they don't want the heat of past associations or whatever the fuck
BLM protests
jontron had that whole thing a couple years (?) ago where he said some racist shit/quoted racist statistics
game grumps started off as jontron and egoraptor, so frankly i expected the deletion of his videos a long time ago
it's rather suspect timing given the BLM protests though
thanks
look at that delightful creature

i mean, they probably wouldn't entertain the demand because it'd be hard to trust that anyone would donate that much money
if they got some proof thouogh
it's a good question of how much money would it take
because all of us like to say "i wouldn't suck a dick for a million dollars" but that's a shit ton of money
i think if you were looking at the stack of cash on a table, you'd be hard pressed to say no

funny, but not appropriate for the broader public in the slightest
that image of the rat eating a heart shaped pancake is delightful, post more things like that
let's see what kind of trouble we can get into
it's quite an experience, isn't it
it makes you realize why in all of those video games, the ancients felt the need to seal powerful items away

useless
no, me calling the bot command does not enter the pool
nor do pings
<@!125433170047795200> you heard it, get to work on a truth or dare command
_i command you_
i keep saying that woc and nat should implement some games that i remember from IRC
hangman is good, as is roulette
snip the wire would also work in a discord format
hot potato would be really fun but wouldn't work with discord unless it was opt in
also, discord has the unfortunate problem of being harder to join back if someone gets kicked
you actually have to find the invite/join link in order to get back, whereas on IRC it was just /join #channel
if it was opt in i guess that would be a risk people were willing to take
oh, shit
a temp ban instead of getting kicked would actually solve that problem handily
and we could just make it remove the role after so many seconds
yeah, exactly
so is stuff like roulette
i don't know, it's just hard to implement this stuff on discord
but only because of the way joining works
can't have games that kick people
i think a temporary channel ban would be just fine, really
i thought having an opt-in command would be too much but IRC did that too, even though channel sizes were infinitely smaller
all of this stuff is actually feasible, god damn
i want more arquius shit
linkybot is great fun but we need games and shit
precisely for when it gets slow around here
i miss the days of IRC when the channel had like 25-30 people
was always fun playing hangman with people in the off hours or doing snip the wire
god DAMN what a great time
no
i mean, maybe there are some newer services that can do it, but that was never a thing back in the day
i used IRC from 2009 or 2010 up to 2014
it was purely text based from what i recall
not if you registered it
if a username wasn't registered then yeah, any one person on a given network could have it
but you could usually register on a given network and assign a password, then it was locked to whoever had that password
yeah
snip the wire was basically a defuse the bomb game
where someone would initiate the command and then there was a 30 second opt-in period
you could also designate what size bomb you wanted, which meant how many wires there were
you could have as few as 2 and as many as 64 wires
among the pile was 1 wire that would detonate the bomb, and users had to take turns !snip a certain colored wire
!snip gold
!snip green
so on
it was a simpler time
well, they instantly drain channel quality as a tragedy of the commons kind of thing
in a place as big as this, you get too many fuckers trying to play and it ruins it
what the fuck
i totally forgot what was on my browser before i left to go take care of stuff today, but then i brought firefox back up and was immediately greeted by this
the semi-colon is integral for the integrity of this meme
that's better
i nod sagely to myself as i continue playing gears of war 5
oh, is it just those?
i thought they were getting rid of the jon ones entirely
surprising given jon's controversy, but fair enough
i don't know anything about the dan era past mario sunshine, so i have no comment
not sure how they would possibly know every episode with potentially insensitive content, unless they asked fans for that info
it's nothing that jon's doing now
it's the old stuff coming back to haunt him again
i don't know how much i care for the change, although not for the reasons you might expect
as much enjoyment as i get out of the jontron era, some of those episodes are admittedly a guilty pleasure
like, a really really guilty pleasure
it's probably for the best that they're getting removed even if they make me laugh
yeah, i think it's more for the editing that it entertains me
but still, probably best not to have it in the first place
the reason i don't like the change is because it gives me the same vibes that a corporation or large entity doing it does
ie they only bothered once it became socially prudent to do so
i would probably be less cynical with other youtubers, i just despise arin at this point
yeah, jon's tweets are... really... uh...
jon, why do you make it so hard for me to enjoy your content
i should probably just give up the ghost at this point, jon really does seem lost to this kind of stupidity
i just
i don't know, i think i've said my piece about this before
but i feel like jon really _doesn't_ put stock in racist shit, i just think that he's one of those people who hears about stuff but doesn't bother to follow up on it, and then when he's called out on being inaccurate, he doubles down because he's embarrassed about it
he's rather progressive on a lot of stuff but then he does this bigbrained centrist bullshit
maybe he's actually racist, at least on a subconscious level
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
what are you agreeing with 100%
ah
also i assume that he's progressive but at least subconsciously racist because of comments he's made in the past that are typically progressive?
at worst i would say that he's right-leaning centrist, but on game grumps at least he's made a number of comments that suggest to me he has left-leaning opinions
so it's kind of bizarre
although in fairness game grumps _was_ 8 years ago
now i guess jontron just sucks dick
which makes me really sad to say, but that's the way it is
i still think most of his videos are overproduced
i've never liked prop humor
him having shitty political opinions is just icing on the cake really
i mean, the south did everything they possibly could to hold on to their ideals of racial superiority
lincoln actually had a plan to blast that ideology into bits when he was still president, but his vice president believed reconciliation was more important and abandoned those ideas
and so when he got assassinated, the south was basically left to its own devices and they set up jim crow laws and shit
yeah, people have pretty strong ties to their identity here
it's a consequence of being a highly individualist culture
NONE OF YOU ARE SAFE
that one feels a bit hamfisted but is no less funny to me

what in the actual fuck
what is this
a linkybot command‚ÄΩ
that'll be fun to come across later
isn't that guy pippin and not merry
ah yes, nevermind
we really need to watch lord of the rings then
stop how dare you
dear god, what the fuck
i'm not sure if corporate YTPs could really work
not that corporate memes work in general really
but like, YTPs in particular display an enormous amount of irreverence for their source material
i'm not sure how that would translate into a brand like wendy's
you get will smith to say some shit like "eat wendy's, they are the best burger"
is that a YTP
i remember watching a show or a video with the guy who made that advertisement
and he explained that he intentionally made it as stupid as possible because it would generate more attention by people talking about how stupid it is with each other
and for a while it worked, areas that aired the commercial experienced a growth in sales
i hope not, i enjoy shitposts sometimes but i've never enjoyed a commercial
commercials and advertisements in general need to be fucking destroyed
you know what
actually
if i saw a commercial like this on TV i would actually be fine with it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN1W1AO32yE
how much does ad time cost and are there any regulations for what you can put in a commercial
VIDEO
UNAVAILABLE
hm
how do commercial regulations even work
i assume that there are guiding laws for tv commercials in general, and then it's based on the channel you're looking to advertise on
like i assume cartoon network and like AMC have different restrictions
i don't see anything in these guidelines that says i can't air bob's borglars 2 as a commercial on prime time television
```‚ÄúHow much does local TV advertising cost?‚Äù

"You may be able to pick up a 30-second ad slot on Oprah through your local affiliate for anywhere from $90 to $300. Or possibly an afternoon soaps rotation for $150 to $300.

Unfortunately, coveted ad spots during the local news are going to cost you more. Costs often range from $200 to $1,500. Your commercial may cost you even more if you want to advertise during popular evening viewing times ‚Äì like between 6 and 7 PM."```
so i could possibly run bob's borglars 2 on a local tv network for a cool 300 bucks
i aspire to be wealthy enough that i can just shitpost on prime time television with various YTPs
but will bob ever borglar?
```You can expect to see some Kansas City TV stations offer time slots as low as $15 during the day```
lit gets like this sometimes
HOISTED BY YOUR OWN PETARD
there's only so long i can talk about putting shitposts on tv unfortunately
it's been one of those days
no, warhammer is banned

okay then
go on
welcome
it's a tad slow today, but that's alright
finally done playing gears of war
that was quite a marathon
<@!207991389613457408> i am fucking astounded with the quality of gears 5
i didn't think 4 was as bad as you said it was, barring the length being meh and not having enough new content for a whole game
but gears 5 was absolutely incredible, especially at the tail end of a marathon through the whole mainline series
it's just like a chef's kiss man
excuse me
```"What's that?"
"It's a gun."```
we need a revolution in this ~~country~~ server

with what exactly
holy shit
that's pretty awesome honestly
i remember the day before the force awakens came out, my roommates and i all marathoned the entire prequel and original trilogy
you're making me nostalgic
i've never seen the extended editions of those movies
lotr i mean
are they worth it
makin has an auxiliary list for tv shows and movies i think
doctor who is aight
it's really gone down hill, if what i've heard is any indication
matt smith (maybe peter capaldi?) is the last one that people cared about in earnest
as soon as it went back to being an old dude the show dropped off the radar
probably has to do with shit writing
<:jaedHapy:230070193160847370>
i would probably eat there at least once

seems it's just not in europe
floating restaurants sound fun
holy shit that's awesome
there are plenty of reasons to distrust the US, i guess this could plausibly count as one

it's not possible to find evidence of a lot of kate's interactions with fans because she outright deleted most of the stuff that got negative reception
the tavris situation is a clear example
lat, the altercation may have started as a misunderstanding but kate escalated it severely

it's like a double cross
tavros manipulated vriska into trying to manipulate tavros _back_ to manipulating vriska into mind controlling him and launching him off a cliff

man, do i ever feel you there dude
when i worked for mcdonalds, i basically wanted to shoot myself in the face every single minute
is it something that could be exhausted for strange cases?
like will you be able to approach competency on all of the stuff that happens, nominal or not?
<:peepo:410814967248584704>
i think that's a regular component of some jobs, being able to adapt as things change
it does feel pretty bad though, always having to keep up
you're smart though, i believe you'll push through if you keep trying
what is it you do exactly, if you're willing to share
<@!504999276393267202> it depends on which position you fulfill, but i'll provide a brief description of each
frontline consists of operating the cash register, making drinks (mostly coffee, orange juice, tea, smoothies, etc. fountain drinks are taken care of in the lobby by customers or by an automatic dispenser near the window for drive through), putting the food into bags and giving it to customers
there is no "frycook" position, it's called "backwall"
backwall takes care of both the grill for hamburgers, grilled chicken, and mcribs when they sell them, and they also take care of fryvats for chicken products
backwall is also expected to clean their grills at least twice daily by turning them off, when i worked there this was initially done by turning the grills off, applying degreaser, and scrubbing with a rough brush until the grills were clean
now i think they have teflon sheets that are simply removed and washed in the sink, and then replaced once they get too sticky
backwall is also expected to run to the fridge/freezer to get more product for themselves to cook or for assembly to put on sandwiches
speaking of, assembly is what we call the line where people put the sandwiches together
it has a bun toaster, condiments, and then a block of heat vats
the heat vats are where you store cooked meat until someone orders it
contrary to popular myth, the heating vats have a timer on them to make sure food doesn't get too old
if it's there for more than 10 minutes, it gets tossed in the garbage
the only time that employees will constantly be making food is during rush period
otherwise, food is made to order
backwall may also be expected to cook french fries on occasion, but i think frontline ends up doing that a lot
there is a maintenance staff but in my experience they're completely useless
janitorial duties are randomly assigned to various people as needed, but it's typically backwall or assembly
bear in mind that i worked in an extremely busy store, this will probably be different based on where you're working and how busy it typically is
that's fucking cursed. delete it immediately
i didn't actually mean it <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that's funny though so i have no regrets
rekt
okay, so what even is this game
also stop warhammer posting or you all die
but warfare, is it like a strategy game thne
reeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
i see
i'll be unavailable for a few horus probab but i want to see what this game is about
it seems fun
an horu and 20 minutes
jesus christ
i'm probably not going to watch the whole thing, but i'll watch the start when i get back
if it looks good i'll probably pick it up
is there multiplayer somehow
bangin'
<@125433170047795200> dude I'm out getting bbq in Kansas city and I looked at the TV in the lobby, then I saw fucking Kornheiser on the screen
I'm so used to seeing him in memes only that having his real face in motion and saying words made me feel like I was having a stroke
man, i'm getting into that mood where i want to play kerbal space program again
thanks musk
<@!273994148825268224> i've actually streamed KSP before
it was one of my most attended streams, lmao
over 20 people at one point
i'm actually somewhat competent at ksp
i've gotten to the point that i made a refueling base on minmus and used that to expand into the rest of the kerbin system
you know, i really should stream it
i want to do some mods though
rendezvous is fun
i'll definitely stream it here in a bit
i just wing it, usually works out well enough
i once slingshotted one from the pluto analog to the neptune analog
it was fun as fuck
slingshotting specifically relies on using the forward momentum of a planetary body in its orbit around the sun
it wouldn't accelerate the craft if the body was stationary
but because the planet has its own momentum around the sun, you can use THAT to increase your own momentum
i can't explain it fully without a diagram of some sort
it's neat though
unless you have the proper hardware, there are exactly two spots where you can easily manipulate your delta v and angle of approach
1) periapsis/apoapsis
2) on the outward bound towards a body
like, if you want to get to mars, you should wait until you're at your periapsis closest to the sun
then you can manipulate your velocity and angle of approach to get as close to mars as possible
then when you are on the way out from the sun, you wait for a while and then set another node so you can fine tune the approach
unless you have a program doing it for you/somehow understand all that fucking math, that's the easiest way to do it
fuck noita time for kerbal space proigram
ehhh
not unless you have a really, really good setup
i can imagine getting back into duna orbit
but not returning to kerbin
don't run refuel missions, that's stupid
set up refueling stations on every body
except for the venus analog's mon
that shit is literally too small, the physics fuck up
no, its' actually quite easy
you're just an idiot
i'm going to prove that you are simply a huge wiener
let me find the newest version of KSP and make a fresh game
tm, all i'm getting out of this is that you don't enjoy the gameplay loop
like, sometimes i do feel like just fucking around and exploring the kerbol system without restrictions
when that happens i just cheat for infinite fuel and get the minimal setup possible for max thrust
otherwise, what you're describing is basically the core gameplay
it's a realistic-ish rocket and space simulator for a reason
if you actually want to get anywhere substantial, it takes a lot of effort
if you don't enjoy that it's one thing, but calling it "not fun" and "tedious" is just an attempt to objectively say "it's not a fun game"
which is wrong
look
i fucking _love_ kerbal space program
are you going to tell me i'm wrong
then you can die

anyway, you're just a lil bitch
<@!273994148825268224> WIENER
it has been done
dingus, how in the actual fuck do you find these things so quickly
i am astounded by how many things you tell us about within like minutes or hours
you're like our fucking bloodhound
i suppose so, yeah
<@!177969813908488193> make it so
holy shit, finally
i had to run streamlabs as administrator to get KSP going
it was agonizing
is it a bad time to stream KSP with the ffbf stuff
yeah, i do
it's fucking great
watch xtra
FUCK
i was scrolled up like a god damn noob
this is the worst
i will avoid streaming for the time being
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
<@!273994148825268224> i think i'm going to wait and stream ksp until you and other people are able to watch my Grand Master Plan
which, i'm going to write up that plan
because i feel pretty good about it
you SUCK
yeah fair enough
ksp in particular is the kind of game you have to be really into what's happening on the stream to care
either way, i'm going to be styling on you in space mothafucka
i'm not sure if they changed KSP but i'm having way more troubled than i remember trying to make these relay satellites
perhaps it's good i didn't decide to stream this right off the bat
i'm not sure if i'm just rusty or of things have changed more fundamentally
it's not even crashing, i'm just having trouble assembling the rockets
well, not the rockets themselves, but the relay subparts
i guess once i get that done the rest should be easier/more fun to watch
sandbox
i can't stand career and science is less fun
i just want the challenge of getting to spass
they will most certainly perish at vital moments
that's the way it is
you know what
just for you qweq, i'm gonna put this on stream anyway
i think i've got the satellite design down anyway
<@!213413608732884994> <https://www.twitch.tv/drewlinki>
hjow dare you
+progress
of what
ah ye
i'm actually wathcing it right now
i think i would definitely try this game out, it seems very interesting and fleshed out
total war warhammer II
the only problem is the price
i've spent too much money recently, 60 bucks is outside of my tolerable range right now
let me know when it goes on sale and i'll see iwhat i can do
i'd love to play this with peeps
me irl
jack and josh are both pretty good
josh's laugh is the only thing that i find weird about him, really, it's like a titter
<@!120187484863856640> eah, youre late
that happened days ago
idiot, charlatan
<a:Apogg:477348807563280385>
oh dear
that doesn't inspire confidence in the slightest
i really hope infinite doesn't turn out like complete crap
you'd think that preparing the original trilogy for PC would help the team re-learn what was so good about the games
i wouldn't be surprised at all if you did this
i also wouldn't really be able to blame you, it's not hard to make me look like a chump but it is very fun

i have been applying for jobs and now i'm drinking and i hate working
i will KILL
i have no choice dude
we are all driven by something in life
the thing i'm driven most by right now is that i need fucking money
the only thing i'm rich in is friends
i can't eat friends nik
no matter how tasty they might be
funny story, i was actually thinking of placing puts on AMC but that train had taken off by the time i thought of it
no ez investment money for me
isn't it super fucked up that the stock market is doing so well with the rest of the economy essentially in shambles
i think you're right, i remember looking at the listings and going "this is too rich for my lower-middle class blood"
i felt super smug after i made a very modest amount of money on a couple lucky calls but after looking at daily trades and the fluctuations in the market, i'm kind of glad i stepped back and decided not to participate
i think i still have money in my robinhood account actually
time to succ that back up and eat a hamborglar with it
... whoa
i haven't checked my portfolio in about a month, but at some point i made 200 dollars

HAHA ISN'T HE FUNEE
no, i'm just frustrated that this guy is """the leader of the free world"""
like, immensely so
it doesn't matter, it's jargon that an elementary school student can understand the words of and interpret as "this is a bad man"
that's all he needs
it's only marginally more sensible
it's still an absurd conspiracy that merits little consideration
yeah, that
i mean, it's important for discussion
just a bit graphic
because a shit ton of people in america are out of shape
regal
moonjail is correct
guns are a vector of death, of course
but the more important aspect is the culture and attitude surrounding their use, and surrounding use of other weapons or methods of defense/offense
people can have guns and may not have had full safety training in them, but unless they foolishly decide to brandish and use them when they aren't supposed to, they'll still be fine
gun control is a separate issue from police brutality
they're related, but not the same thing
this is the fucking

who wants to watch brave little toaster tomorrow
why must you be like this
ah, that explains why i was able to watch it on youtube tv earlier today
good to know the strike was removed
hot take i don't like that track very much
anyway i'll upload the toaster movies
best music btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoHCpa4rG7I
look, the original halo trilogy is fucking incredible okay
it's honestly one of the better video game trilogies out there
point me to another one that handled itself as well
cuz i'll play that shit
then clearly your expectations were not low enough
<@!125433170047795200> <@!146014279529791488> it is done, i have purchased a fleet carrier
i've decided i'm bringing it out into the black, near the fringes of the xibalba secotr
if you want to check it out, i'll be leaving it in or around the bubble for the next few days at least
i'll provide the system where i stop with it in a moment

NEVERMIND

yeeeeeaaaahhhh i'm just going to wait for frontier to fix this
wtf bros
so is the first season of the office just really bad
because i'm on the second episode and i really fucking hate it
is it possible to just
skip to the second season
alright i'll do that then
see, okay
right off the bat this made me actually laugh
the part where michael scott is like struggling to contain his laughter while he sings mambo number 5 and a recorder is beeping alongside him
that's fucking great
i'm glad i decided to skip to the second season

i have notes written down for i think one or two days, but i have no motivation to write it out
i've openly invited people to tell me what's happening when i'm less available
i have a hard time keeping track of things
i'm trying to download a realistic solar system mod for ksp and it's just not working
i'm sure i'm fucking it up but the notes are inconsistent and i'm too tired/tipsy for this
i diagnose you with dead
i never thought i would actually bother to enjoy the office, and yet here i am
skipping to season 2 was a great idea
<@!111477124384202752> i'll say it as many times as i god damn want
enough of this horseshit
i need to take stats
i was absolutely determined not to think whatever you said was funny, but that caught me off guard

can i help you
okay have a good night
fuck you
i was going to actually do that
you ruined it
what in the fuck
oh, of course it's disco elysium shit
tensei just posts stuff he finds funny
i think he's ascended beyond taking anything he does or witnesses on the internet seriously
i played an hour of disco elysium and stopped because i didn't get much out of it yet
i plan to go back and try again sometime but not right now
<:eyes_fast:417208120859951105>
i would say "it has to be something i wanted to do on my own anyway" but to be honest i end up dropping shit i earnestly want to do regardless
does he have to do that for every shill or is it a one time deal
there's a couple newer ones i never bothered to do
once i hit all of the shills that were required at one point and reached ~Gold Status~ i basically said i'm done
i never did make an official recommendation to makin though
i'm not anywhere near as well read as he is, i guess i figured all of the shit i could earnestly recommend would be stuff he knows about already, and i didn't want to make him follow through on the promise of reading a substantial amount of my recommendation if i made it something like eloze
i would totally have put eloze on the shill leaderboard just for visibility and personal bias, but makin doesn't need to suffer through that

<@&693935623966425219> i brought up the idea of watching the brave little toaster last night, but i remembered we've watched it recently. if you don't care and would be down to watch it again, react with ‚úÖ . if you want to watch the sequel about stupid animals instead, react üîµ . if either of those options gets over 10, we'll do that tonight
also holy shit, opening my emotes and seeing this was a little shocking
it's okay, chat's a bit slow today
if we don't get enough reacts within an hour or so i'll call it off
```‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt fucking care. I‚Äôve been dead inside for years,‚Äù Bauman said.```

man, shout out to the california meetups
everyone was so chill
once the 'rona disappears, mayhaps
it's no longer a 16 hour drive to get there, so i'd actually consider something of a roadtrip
i gotta tell you, randomly looking in here and seeing my face blown up and plastered in the chat really shook me
andrew shut the fuck up about me looking similar to nerds on the internet
there's only so many times i can hear "are you dunkey"
i will KILL you
okay, i'm serious
stop talking about me looking like people
i regret sharing my picture in here, we should all have remained faceless entities forever
one of my colleagues at VT is from australia
my gf likes to binge older tv shows and she ran across one called H2O: Just Add Water
which was a really dumb but funny teen drama back in the mid to late 2000s
anyway, i approached my colleague and started up a conversation about her accent
i don't remember how it went exactly, but i saw the very second in her eyes where she feared a comparison to steve irwin
then i brought out "H2O: Just Add Water" and then she started laughing super hard

what on earth do you mean
computers are racist?
okay, _can_ be racist is way different from _are_ racist
i understand fully that peculiarities in AI logic or programming can lead to the sort of scenario you described
you just made it sound like computers are by their innate properties racist
you know else is disingenuous?
me jumping into this conversation without reading the backlog
i have no idea what "butlerian jihad" means
is it some kind of meme
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
watching the office is fun, both in a direct and kind of detached way
i'm noticing a lot of parallels in the way the show is constructed versus the way i write spat
is that arrogant to say, actually? i just mean that they have similar focuses
it's really neat to see how people interact with each other and how they're collectively affected by certain events
yes, good, stroke my ego
i tried watching the pilot for the office like two years ago and i hated it with a passion
skip to season 2 immediately
i don't know how or why but it's just done much better
i feel like there's a question of efficiency and sustainability in here somewhere
i would be more convinced--sure
if we're speaking on a term of scale then what you're suggesting makes sense
damn, i' mmissing the stream? unacceptable
is it fucking over? god damn it
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
<@!298516367311765505> you keep asking for the world file, here it is
we need a reckoning
forest fires on a small scale are natural and necessary for redistributing nutrients back into the soil
large scale forest fires are often caused by poor forestry practices and can cause immense destruction of human life and property
no, i was clearing up what you said because you're an idiot who said things wrong
maybe if you weren't so dum dum this wouldn't have happened
also yeah, i'm not doing reckonings
i don't agree with them as a method for selecting mods
i only really support them as a server-wide event that shakes things up
shaking things up can be fun and exciting
speaking of, i just now realized that tomorrow is 6/12 and i've done literally nothing to prepare for it
i'm just going to say "happy 6/12 we're not doing anything special, spend some time with your loved ones"
linkybot ain't on it today
nevermind
that was quality
achewood has a very particular energy to it that is not quite matched by anything else
i find the CHAZ interesting but the only in-depth thing i've read about was an anarcho-communist blog
so obviously it's not unbiased
i was going to say when i first heard of it, "is it a closed system or is it receiving supplies from outside?"
if it's not self-sustaining then it's not indicative of very much
beeg is old, leave her alone
Internet broke
Losing my mind
Les miserables for the meme value, ratatoing for the culture
I've heard it's not that fun to actually watch
i'm being forced to tether my phone to my laptop to be able to participate, pissed
what have i missed tonight
no vac
shit's fucked
no problem
nooo
seriously though, i don't think it's a good time to have a community stream
people are probably 1) dealing with the pandemic and or 2) dealing with protesting and stuff like that
i say "probably" loosely
<:precisely:668709784320606219>
yeah, but it's a convenient excuse
oh shit
it's close enough that i'm just going to say happy borth barkley
what is wrong with you people
üßπ OUT
NONE OF YOU ARE FREE OF SIN
andrew, how do you have such weird and absurd opinions so frequently
How can you have an opinion on something you haven't seen in years
god damn, every time i remember that it makes me laugh
another mod meme classic
sometimes i think of makin's jokes about creating a #courtroom or a channel for publicly discussing mod matters
i swear that half the stuff we have to deal with, people would be in disbelief
he said it as <:jokes:569946339685957642>  but i'm thinking of it half seriously
it'll never happen realistically, but the idea is harebrained enough that it amuses me

#tales-from-modchat
i think mike blossom is still the top of the list, although i'm sure there are some contenders

god DAMN IT
YOU'RE FUCKING ME UP KRATO

this is the glory of mike blossom
i don't remember vimer, share it with me
the most recent pin?
oh god, yes
post that
oh
<@!155401695138938881> yeah it can literally be censored
if we do make a #tales-from-modchat we would probably have to make that standard policy
lmao

here, i'm making an executive decision
i'm gonna post the original with names censored
and no one can stop me

you see what we put up with to make this a better place?
you'er welcome
i don't agree that this person has beat mike blossom
mike was a quick one two that was absurd in its offensiveness
this guy you're talking about right now is like a borderline white supremacist
i think that some of these deserve to be shared though, just for historicity's sake
like, you people doubt us when we say we put up with some weird shit

<@!213413608732884994> i'm now semi-seriously considering opening up a #tales-from-modchat channel where we post the best stupid interactions we have with malcontents
inb4 "that's a stupid idea, and you deserve death"
yeah but most people don't actually look in here
tales from mod chat would be more inclusive and therefore better
how can we not do it right if we censor all names
that should be fine you wiener
i'm not actually going to do it, jesus christ you people are wet blankets
that's... half the point of censoring names
they get no recognition that way
and also avoid harassment
bah, you people are no fun
"tales from mod chat" reminded me of "tales of IT guy" and i'm enjoying myself greatly reading this stuff
that's fucking hilarious
fucking "Google Ultron"
ohm y god


shut the fuck up
+progress
ping me again tomorrow
i need to go tbed and my internet is broken
this conversation is more technical/clinical than not, but something about seeing the phrase "crotch spelunking" instantly made me want to shut it down
no, it's fine
it just tripped a sensor in my brain
my dude, there's no need to be hostile about it
they're just giving you the runaround, they're not seriously insulting you for anything
that's because they're vaguely less memorable
there are plenty of people here who have joined and become regulars under more pleasant circumstances
your argument is based on you're banned
as it is, i was talking to the new guy
so check your fucking privilege
<:eyes_fast:417208120859951105>
that's... pretty explicit
<@!706685578678108160> i'm not sure what there is to explain further, this channel covers a wide range of topic and is distinguished by being an unofficial mod hangout channel as well as talking about literature more often than other channels
gorbachev, tear down this wall
makin used to be the server owner but then really bad shit went down earlier this year that is still depressing to recall
<@!706685578678108160> we have a really well-established history and culture here, it can be intimidating but we're pretty alright

adam sandler movie jack and jill
god, don't even say that
it's like saying murder is okay
as far as i'm aware, dunkaccino was never a real product
it was exclusively a plot point in jack and jill
"i'd rather be watching avatar"
spat is also gradually becoming less useful the less i write in it
i just have trouble identifying anything truly unique happening each day, which is totally fine
i just don't want to constantly spin my wheels
god, you're right
yeah, we were talking for a while about the sorts of bullshit the mods have to deal with
how is this self-congratulating
i just said that i don't feel like writing shit anymore
Hey everyone. Just to keep you all informed: usually we have a community stream on 6/12, but this year it's been way too busy to prepare for, so we're just going to take it easy. ~~Also Makin is streaming Fringe later today so blame him~~ Take care of yourselves, and happy 6/12!
i was going to ask why people get so hung up on participating in conversations, but then i remembered i was pretty bad about that when i was younger
well, it's technically fine
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
it never stops happening
yeah, everyone forgot because homestuck fucking sucks now
yeah, i already saw that
<@!706685578678108160> we're not idiots, come back when you're of age
i mean, there's no wiggle room here
discord TOS is no one under 13

how are we supposed to take anything you say at face value
because it's funnee
bah, whatever

oh, i've actually done this routine before
it hurts when you fuck it up
it's also easier to do when you only have four trombone players
oh hey a thing i watched got referenced in another thing i'm watching
maybe i should be paying more attention to fringe except not really because it isn't anywhere as influential as LOST
this is horrifying
THE PINGER
~~it's not important, let's be real~~
it happens too quickly after 4/13
it's like celebrating 11/11 after 10/25
actually, 4/13 and 10/25 being the two community holidays actually works out great because it's like six months between them
space dirt sounds great
i mean
sure it is
but that doesn't change the fact that it's vaguely significant for homestuck too
it's like if we had a meme day on 10/31 and going "but that's halloween, everyone celebrates it"
yes, but we also celebrate it for different reasons <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
every time i go looking for a flash game to play, i remember why i don't play flash games anymore
yeah, that's always a profoundly uncomfortable experience
the story is... exceptionally clear
i don't understand where you're coming from
the writing was largely viewed as witty at the time, but has aged badly as has most of joss whedon's work
ultron is less bad in that regard but holistically sucks more
<@!120187484863856640> i know avatar starts in a few minutes but i'm grabbing a kebab, start without me or wait a few minutes it's whatever works for you guys
Whenever I think of the word kebab all I can think of is that one German movie that has a fake movie in it called KING OF KEBAB
No, we haven't gotten to the kebab place yet
Shouldn't be too much longer though
Well if it's going to be a problem you can just start, I don't really mind
I dont know like 15 minutes?
Depends on if theres a line
Alright misha "garbage ape" tarkus
Tragedy: the kebab place was closed today
We found different food though and are on our way back
you know what sounds great? cake pops
what kind of cake do they use for that stuff
it's got this wonderful texture and mouth feel to it
not overly sweet either
yeah that's right
GET YOUR _FACTS_ STRAIGHT
that's a lot of fish
the fuck is this garbage?
okay, i basically sat through that entire thing without laughing and was honestly just vaguely irritated
then "i ate those food" happened and it got me good
wow
i don't even play point and clicks but i'm amazed at how evocative those videos are of that gritty, grainy style
what is the song
i require it
<@!266807632390520833> you are my hero for tongiht
what's the most privileged classpect
ah, thanks for the reminder
man, i could have sworn that he's in snow is in there somewhere
i'll double check
very good, thank you
IT'S ALL CONVERSATIONAL REFERENCES, ALL THE WAY DOWN
<@!168980988477702145> <@!111477124384202752> LOOK AT THIS FUCKING SHIT
you are both FAILURES
<@!168980988477702145> no you fucking ree, i'm saying that the pin was already IN THERE
i didn't add this today, it's been in there since the beginning
you both have shitty eyes
god DAMN you people cardposting
also sorry andrew, i thought you were involved in that
i hate magic the gathering
it's coarse, and rough, and it gets everywhere
this by itself is worthy as a reaction image
<@!131650004606648320> this is so fucking stupid but it _immediately_ made me laugh
good job
you can now do IT
alright i've got vodka
you know what THAT means
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S time for me to play noita quietly
i'm too tired to write spat, although i do have notes for like three days worth of stuff
did anything particularly interesting happen today
fair enough
like i've said though, if people want me to write more then they should take notes and give them to me
it's already in
i wonder what this place would look like if everyone was totally anonymous
probably a different shade of green to them
you can still distinguish between numerous shades of the same general color
holy fucking shit
are you just reading through achewood
or is there some kind of random button
STANDIN' AT THE AIIIIIRPORT / LOOKIN' DOWN THE STRIP / SHE WAS DRYIN' HER EYES / SHE WAS BITIN' HER LIP
electric light orchestra is one of the best bands in existence
shit, i just realized i'm crashing a conversation, i'm sorry
i have become what i hated most
what the fuck is this
is that supposed to mean something to me
do you have cotton in your fucking ears
i just said whatever sounded funniest to me at the moment, and it worked
TAK AND THE POWER OF JUJUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
oh
oh my fucking god
<@!168980988477702145> i just found the adjustment for my office chair that increases the seat "depth"
i have been so uncomfortable on this chair for the last two days
now it is like i am in ass heaven
noita is hard : (
chris onstad is a genius
of unparalleled magnitude
we really do need to become an achewood server
it's galactic law that whenever "Work Harder" comes up in chat i have to listen to it at least once
i put 1 million dollars in "nothing"
and that's counting west coast time
wow, unconventionally accurate
<:gasp:375465925446467595>
DANCESTORSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
_lusus_
i actually prefer porrim
she seems stable at the very least
everyone else is a basket case
i'm mad guys
not really, but listening to "work harder" is putting me in an "OOHUGH" mood
<:tereziFuck:585539573539405868>
yeah, you're right
that's a damn shame
yeah... if only...........................................
WELP, BACK TO NOITA
SHE'S BLIND, REMEMBER????????????
holy fucking SHIT woc
i'm drunk right now but this sequence of images made me laugh so hard that my fucking sternum hurts
<@!321448117792669697> fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you
how are you doing
nothing, i'm just drinking
not much longer thankfully
i feel you dude
i just graduated and have my master's degree but i'm also back home and trying to find a job
it's just a big bowl of ree
one moment
i like a fine missouri histosol
reminds me of where i grew up
https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/soil-orders/histosols
missouri has some natural forests
i grew up next to one on our farm, the soil is extremely rich in carbon
yes, soil is extremely complicated and there's a lot of shit that goes into examining it
look
soil is hard right
attempts to categorize it are difficult because the nature of it is so absurdly complicated from all the _stuff_ that's in it that it has an entire taxonomy
it's not just a histosol, it's a histosol from missouri
and it's not just a histosol from missouri, it's a histisol from missouri in the western region
and it's not just in the western region, it's from a specific county, from a specific town, etc
no
fuck you
you would be staked for even suggesting such a thing
hwah
inception came out ten years ago

yeah, we actually rewarded that person for their comic
it was fucking _good_
god damn i hate everything
i'm not sure that the bottleneck is the difficulty of making the game
like, let's be fair, most of us would have no idea how to make a video game
but i feel like if we tried, we could figure it out
no, not really
we conceptualized an idea, put a little effort into it, and then stopped
which is along the lines of what i'm suggesting is happening here
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
i jusky
you know
i gotn othign
yes
figt me 1v1 irl mines
i'l ickick your ass i swear on me fookin mum
holy shit i slept for like 11 hours today
all of you shut up
furries are now banned
well woc
we're _waiting_
let's watch caddyshack sometime
that movie is great
woc this is like a hair away from shitposting
stimulate actual discussion you fucking troglodyte
alcohol is a fucking awful flavor
it's like the flavor of static
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
üî™
tomatoes in sandwiches are perfectly common
yeah i was talking about shutting them all down
watch your asses, everyone
none of you are safe
pathetic
i believe so
https://onipress.com/pages/achewood
<@!120187484863856640> yeah, i'm not going to be around for stream today
that is all
excuse me
well that was a fucking exhausting conversation in mod chat
yeah, the tongue just makes me think of "BUENO"
anyway, if it has genitalia in it or is suggestive of genitalia and it's not fine art, don't post it
should be common sense, but as always we'll probably have to ban people trying to skirt the rule
dogg
interior crocodile alligator
i drive a chevrolet movie theater
i think i'm going to stop being lazy and actually write out the spat entries i have notes for
has wales commented on what happens to the souls of people whose bodies are completely destroyed? i assume that if the soul is unrecoverable it just goes straight to the hells
damn, that sucks
it really do be like that sometimes üòî
misha has had a lot to say about that
he thinks that columbus is viewed worse now than he was contemporaneously
no argument here
<:pog:576614562598748213>
sorry i missed stream today btw what episode of avatar did i miss
oh nice
i'll go ahead and watch those on my own
<@!266807632390520833> add boomerang too
sokka's boomerang
you fuck
i was more saying you should just... make it
because makin yells at me whenever i make emotes
the mean old brute
nah i'm good for now
thanks nostalgo
death
what in the actual fuck <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i really need to start achewood
i think i'll do that tonight
alright, that's enough achewood posting for today woc buddy
+progress
nice
excuse me
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
so many things to do
<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
haven't you asked me this before
i believe i said i was a nice silty loam
perish for your transgressions
also it really depends on the kind of plant
cacti and other plants used to nutrient poor soils won't do better in soil with lots of nutrients in them, it'll actually kill them
kind of an inverse of putting crops in sand and clay
depends, is the entire plant in their ass or is it only one part like the roots
is it bad that i immediately started thinking of an experimental set up for this
i imagined making it so someone is restrained and fed/watered in a position where their ass is high to the sky, exposing the plant to gain more sunlight
no, it's not
shit has plenty of nitrogen, it's just not in a form that plants can use
nitrates and nitrites are the most readily uptaken forms of nitrogen
nitrogen in shit is typically in the form of urea or ammonia
depends on the animal
<@!184545248930693120> we need you for an experiment
https://giphy.com/gifs/optical-illusions-asap-science-aZ3LDBs1ExsE8 mines and mint walking in like
uh
misha, that's not how that works
no it's not
i know more than you about this
this is practically the shit that i got my master's degree in
i have a master's degree in horticulture, with my thesis being about the application of composted chicken litter to soil microbial communities
so yes
oh wow that's a perfect response
bacteria doesn't transfer through the roots and stems of the plant like that
i don't doubt that the tomato plant itself wouldn't be healthy as a result of growing it in someone's ass
but if a normal tomato plant could hypothetically be grown from someone's ass, all it would be doing is transferring nutrients from the source to the rest of the biomass
bacteria typically don't penetrate through the root and get into the rest of the plant, it's not like the bloodstream of animals
yeah, basically misha
you realize that a ton of crops are typically fertilized with manure?
we don't have to apply antibiotics to those plants, they just get washed off
i don't think anyone here would eat an ass tomato without washing it first
no don't, we need it for science
<:wackyZany:230072349431431169>
this is the best conversation we've had in months
look, it's going to be rough on the space farm
people have to make a living somehow
"i grew this tomato myself!"
```Babies can be fed tomatoes as they have plenty of health benefits. The right age that you can introduce tomatoes to your child is around 8 to 10 months. Tomatoes generally do not cause any allergies but keep an eye out, just in case, for rashes on your baby's skin after they've consumed tomatoes.```
as long as both parties are fully consenting, what's the issue
don't be fruitist
fruitophobic
SHUT THE FUCK UP
I HATE YOU
let's put this legendary conversation to rest
as much as i enjoyed it, there's only so long we can talk about growing crops out of one's anus
nah, i'm not streaming that
i don't exactly have a good streaming environment right now
sory
also new spat entry depends on when makin wakes up and can review what i've written
i've got five entries written up, hot off the presses
i'll tell you the final page count when i review them and make sure everything's good
really feeling this tonight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HQLfcLhMt8
wait, what in the fuck
yeah, the ending of it is corrupted or some shit
well that sucks
uh oh, discord search broke
guess i'll give it some time and if it's still not working, i'll waggle my fist in mock anger
that's because it's been like 30 seconds you fucking ingrate
what diversity would i lose with you, having a canadian mod? pfft
dime a dozen really
god damn it
i wanted to find a quote to add to this entry but i'm not willing to scroll through a day's worth of conversation to get it
is your search function working
it was about the interactions with stupid people that mods have
i said something like "you people wouldn't believe how often this happens"
found what i said, thanks tera
9 pages of spat, that's nice
i look forward to putting these up
oh no
that's how i take stats
discord fix your shit
his stats aren't totally accurate
i mean, nothing is when you get down to it
our virtual world is a lie
noita giving me a fucking HERNIA
why in the fuck do you people keep talking about furries
stop this nonsense
wat
do not
how does church keep getting so cursed late at nigt
i
i mean chat
no, god dammit
stop resorting to furry discussions
i'm starting to get annoyed by this
it's annoying as shit when it happens too often, just like any other topic
and for some god forsaken reason, there's a hefty number of chat members here who start furry posting late at night
yes, it is also annoying when people talk about warhammer too much
you know what, i'm just going to start banning people
everyone who speaks after this message is banned
BANNED

alright you can all come back
i accidentally deleted some extra roles, i didn't bother to check which ones
sorry
nah
nah as in "no they don't"
WRONG i always mean to do that
this is a stupid line of questioning, i would just be an earthbender with all of the subdivisions that entales
like sand, metal, mud, and lava bending
and any others
that would be a completely adequate superpower
your hypothetical sucks, die
fuuuuuuUUUUUUUUUCK NOITA IS HARD
what trophies
holy fucking shit
there have been some changes to this game since i last played
apparently there's now a mini-boss in the pyramids
i didn't know this, and it scared the absolute shit out of me
god... dammit
i looked away from the screen for four seconds and died to fire i didn't know was there
why must this game be so temperamental
no
pun never intended
shut up
if you say one more word you're unmodded
also i wonder exactly how much of this game is randomized and to what extent
no, i'm just tired
that's been there for ages
i think that something special happens if you find all of them in a single session
not sure though
i'll look it up
```The health of the final boss (Kolmisilm√§) increases exponentially with each orb; reaching a max of 131,181 HP if all orbs have been collected.```
<:waitwhat:316648744579760128>
<@!120187484863856640> the draft is done, so check it out whenever you get a chance
i don't know, it seems kind of fun
it's not actually that effective as a political statement, nor is it sustainable, but it does look enjoyable for as long as it might last
i'm sure it'll be an interesting story to tell their kids someday
it's probably not sustainable, at least not by the metrics i'm considering
they're either receiving aid and supplies from outside the zone or it's too small/disorganized to produce food and other resources in a timely manner
jesus
reading that twitter thread is like descending into madness
i don't see a ping from you carl
i don't get it, what am i supposed to respond to here
canis i've lost the thread of what you're describing, but it sounds like you're trying too hard or overthinking it
twitter as a platform is completely unusable for high-caliber discussions
that is probably the better option, yes
that's the spirit!
not really, unless you're a super genius and/or devote your entire life to studying various fields
if it takes 4 years to earn a bachelor's degree, then you'll spend over two decades learning engineering, math, and the harder sciences like biology, chemistry, and physics
(maybe less since there's overlap in the secondaries for those majors)
but then you have stuff like writing and art
and language
and softer sciences
and then other fields of study like geography
and this is just for a bachelor's degree
which is arguably just scratching the surface
graduate studies for a master's degree take another 2 years minimum, PhDs are three to five
unless you drastically change the definition, no one can be a renaissance man or a polymath anymore
it's possible to be a _generalist_ though, who can redirect people who want to know something towards experts more suited to answer a question
actually i've already thought of ways to take the stuff i've learned and perform experiments/develop methods for growing crops on other celestial bodies
wait, who are you talking about
0hp lovecraft??
it's really weird to hear you say that, because almost every single one of his posts are harebrained, inflammatory nonsense
like what
well, he's not wrong
canis, the trick is to be suspicious of all people and things at all times
then you can do no wrong, unless you forget or are sufficiently fooled
so basically it accomplishes nothing
~~i wasn't being serious, to be clear~~
yes, this is the appropriate amount of scrutiny to apply to the real world
if you aren't checking every single bit of food or drink you receive for poison, then you're just asking for death
it is a curious thing, isn't it
the boundary between conscious entities can become somewhat... blurred

spat update at a reasonable time for once https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/bookii2020.html#25M
the last few days have been strange even by our standards
this is what you get for leaving us
THIS IS YOUR PUNISHMENT
i wish i could be that carefree dude
it'd probably be better for my blood pressure
vac, i think i may have asked this before, but do you prefer being called bolas now
your name change has persisted for so long
just making sure
i can't read
apparently they're a baby fur artist
yeah go ahead misha
delete that, it's spoilers
we're still on book 2
yeah, we have some people who have never seen the show with us
<@!111477124384202752> just so i know you won't miss it, spat update, check changelog
aw man, i went fishing and missed a bunch of fun discussion
sad!
<:blobuwu:417336490214031372>
man, stop asking me to get DOS2
itj ust makes me want to get it even less than i already do
you know, now that i've gotten a decent way into the office, i think all of the memes and tumblr posts i've seen about it were looking through extremely rose-tinted glasses
michael scott has his moments of true concern and niceness, but by and large he's an egotistical, histrionic asshole
i wouldn't be charmed by him if i worked under him, i would probably hate his guts
also andy is a fucking sack of dicks
i hate him with a passion
stanley's great though, i would probably be him if i had an office job
what's a woman ?

"why she look like meg griffin" alright thanks for that
ruining my life
it's the same reason watching best of the worst works
all of those movies they watch fucking suck dick
but hearing them laugh about how badly they suck makes it funny
i fear the day that they find something better than surviving edged weapons
i don't think so 1011
isn't it wonderful that things should be this way
no

i'm really bad at configuring spells with my wand to get good shit
that's what i thought, but i can never find one THAT good
maybe i'm just badly prioritizing stuff
i'll play again once i'm done helping my sister build her PC
isn't always cast a perk
oh?
yeah i definitely don't pay attention to the passive perks on wands themselves
i might ask for some help when i play here in a bit
cuz i always feel like i'm doing something wrong
Reeeeeeeeeee always some difficulty with getting a computer to work
<@!111477124384202752> i forgot
also my sister's computer appears to be working <:Pog:527414364563570709>
no, my other sister
dero already has a gaming pc
this is my other sister's first time making and owning a gaming pc
success
the computer is set up
four and a half hours of work completed
sister's really excited
i actually feel like i internalized some of the ways the computer works and how to put it together this time
maybe i should go into IT work
i love computers and i like problem solving on them when it's not some ridiculously stupid issue
which is like 90% of them in fairness
>dump bagel crumbs out of CD drive
>boot up laptop
>it works
alright i have booted up noita
<@!213413608732884994> you're on speed dial bitch

what the hell kind of weather is this
i can't see SHIT
okay, this spell is fucking awesome
just killed myself in the dumbest way possible
i hate everything
okay qweq
what are the basic good qualities i should look for in a wand besides fast reload and cast speed
this helps a bit, yeah
i guess i'm overthinking it and most of this just boils down to luckl
sure, if i find anything interesting
i haven't found lightning for like fifty playthroughs
they changed the balance of this game heavily since the last time i played it
<@!213413608732884994> interesting playthrough so far

this combined with homing shots is killing a lot of things in one go
i also picked up edit wands everywhere which is great
i just died in the most fucking asinine manner
i got polymorhped into a sheep and then one of my own projectiles hit a box and exploded and killed me
i'm so tired
yo what the fuck is this
<@!213413608732884994> i'm going on a journey to the eastern parallel world
i managed to pick up both the chainsaw and luminous drill
i need a better wand but i'm also going to grind perks to try and get a busted combination
okay, i forgot that there's a layer of cursed rock separating parallel worlds now, so that sucks
"this place is better than being horribly, terribly alone"
just seems like a kind of low bar
please don't do this to us

yeah, i'm taking my fleet carrier out into the black
xibalba is heavily underrepresented when people talk about going exploring
so i'm going to take my fleet carrier out to that region, find a nice ELW, and then park it there
it'll be a beacon out in the middle of nowhere for any wayfarers who might seek refuge
you got it
if you want to visit it before i go out, then it's at the chemaluk system
i'll be stocking up on tritium so i don't have to mine it as i go out

i don't have to know the person who drops a deuce in the public bathroom to know their shit smells bad
<:ree:475542526791516170>
yeah that wasn't a clear warning at all, i'm overruling it
but i'm also officially declaring that we move on and not talk about it anymore, since we now know that woc is actually upset about it
moon, shut up
<@!213413608732884994> it's been 3000 years...
insomnia is my favorite outside the dark tower series by him, although given how closely related they are to each other perhaps that doesn't mean much

avatar is so good
yeah, you can really get some distance going if you're smart about it
when i was binging elite dangerous i would just go for like six hours and do nothing but jump in, scoop, scan, and jump out
if you forego scanning, you can get a few thousand LYs done in one day like that
very good shit
also remember, if you want to visit my fleet carrier before i leave the bubble later tonight, it'll be in the Chemaluk system
the station's name is Omphalos

Good job idiot
Clearly it is your fault
Excuse me
What gold room andrew
Oh, you mean
... The Gold
I'll explain in a bit
<@!125433170047795200> my first sale as a fleet carrier <:pog:576614562598748213> thanks for coming to visit
i'm gonna stock up on tritium and head back out into the black, possibly permanently
it depends on what kind of mining you're doing
i showed you core mining, which is equally viable no matter where you are or what kind of material you're looking for
however, meta revolves around laser mining at double or triple hotspots
i grinded out federation ranks and have a corvette for laser mining since it can store more lasers and has a bigger cargo hold
but a python is a good middle substitute
i also have a python for mining, but it's for cores instead of lasers
+progress
damn
what's the range on your asp
<@!111477124384202752> let me explain now
the gold room refers to an enormous, squarish thing of gold that's on the eastern border of the world
i don't know what the fuck gnawms was talking about, but you have to get up and over the mountain (or however you choose to get past it) and then make your way to ???
do you know about any of this
alright, then it's above and a little to the left of ???
take a north west north approach and you'll hit it
also sorry woc, i didn't reaize this was lit
i'll go in
no, you have to break _through_ the unbreakable wall
there's nothing on the outside of it, it's inside the wall
for core mining you should have a pulse wave analyzer to find core asteroids, seismic charge launcher in order to actually crack it open, and then an abrasion blaster for getting all the tiny chunks inside the core
for laser mining you just need lasers
laser mining is far faster within a triple hotspot but is far slower than core mining anywhere else
so if you're going somewhere that doesn't have a confirmed triple hotspot, just do core mining
it has a lot more flying around and looking though, just a warning
then that should be all you need i think
nothing unless you want stuff to defend from pirates
but the thing with pirates is that they'll typically appear only once
right when you jump out into the asteroid belt
or ring
once they scan you and heckle you for having no rare materials, they'll jump away and never bother you again
UNLESS you quit the game and get back in, then they'll come bother you again and you'll have to run away if you have anything in your hold
very annoying, but only a short interruption
yes andrew
or chaotic polymorphine
worms can tunnel through anything
it's a free slot basically
you CAN put a subsurface missile launcher on it if you want to mine any surface deposits, but those are basically worthless shit
put a weapon on there if you want
it's whatever you like
no i don't remember that in fact
when was this
low temperature diamonds are your best bet, and those are always in icy rings
hotspots don't appear based on anything other than the type of ring, it's all random chance
they are delightful
it depends on market fluctuations
monazite can be worth more in some markets but the galactic average usually says it's not
here, let me pull up the inara market readings
https://inara.cz/galaxy-commodity/10245/
https://inara.cz/galaxy-commodity/144/
ooh, LTD are at a premium right now, anything over 1 mil is good but 1.5 mil is great
but see, the overall point is that you can't trust what the cargo thing tells you
gotta go by what the third party websites are reporting
damn, he's got us there
yeah, it's kind of ridiculous isn't it
oh fuck
you know, i wonder how that shit works for a fleet carrier's market
does selling things at the fleet market make it draw money from the fleet carrier itself???
that would make sense but i have no real idea
i'll have to test this out
ez lyfe
glad you're getting into the mining game
it's very tedious but very lucrative
what are you trying to do with all that cashola
<:ree:475542526791516170>
yep, there you go
now go in and start blasting
void opals sell for a lot too, not sure how much but i think it gets over 1 mil a ton every so often
oh hot damn, you good then
ALWAYS oohugh post
i also have an irresistible urge to put on forever turbo heat dance when this comes up
i end up listening to it for half an hour
how on earth is the PS5 that big
it's almost unseemly
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
what's the matter geoffrey? do you like ponies?
alright, it's time
i begin my journey to xibalba
i mean, the visuals aren't as important as presentation
you can make a cartoon creepy, it's about how everything meshes together
that shit's creepy because it's claustrophobic
Just a small announcement: we recently hit 17,000 users on Discord and 60,000 on the subreddit! Thanks for being here and being part of our community, you're all awesome. <a:aTavGuitar:393666646117449739>
i see people ranting about homestuck but mostly as a periphery
homestuck as a cultural entity is firmly dead at this point
a sufficient number
hoo boy
i underestimated how much tritium it would take to get out there
i'm almost out of funds already <:wackyZany:230072349431431169>
why
i agree with that reasoning, i just wanted to jump in on the "why" train
how's it going in here today my fellows
attention, this carrier has scheduled a hyperspace jump. please conclude all business prior to departure.
that's good to hear
i'm playing elite dangerous and it's very fun
getting ready for a big project
looking for jobs
you know, the daily grind
etc, etc
it probably doesn't
it's just an excuse for the school to try and fuck you over
college is the same but worse
a 500 dollar book you purchased at the beginning of the semester is worth 15 bucks at the end of it
yeah, after searching for the asteroids themselves, that's easily the worst part of mining
collector limpets make me want to cut someone's dick off
yeah basically
good rule of thumb is to bring like 75% of your inventory
you can just dump extra if they decide to behave better than usual
i always feel bad when i do that, it's like beating a puppy with a belt
ooh, i just modified the appearance of my fleet carrier and this thing looks great
let me try and find better lighting and i'll send a picture

welcome to the brotherhood of phat stacks
never let it be said that elite dangerous is a balanced, fair game
after this last six months, i don't think anything surprises me anymore
a valid idea
i have little idea what the gameplay of cyberpunk 2077 is or what will look like
aesthetically it's interesting
unless the story is extremely good though, i will not even give ita look
we need to upgrade this server
thoguhts?
#seminar
make it so
no don't do it
it would grow old quickly
we need better ideas
existing
how is that not a violation of twitter TOS by the way
i think that might legitimately be the first time crazy frog has been compared to the statue of david in any capacity
sounds like my idea of a good time
... no
just looking at that thumbnail nearly made me fall asleep
i'll look at it next year
night all, don't le the server burn down while i'm away
nopr
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
that is a horrific story, thank you for sharing
not yet, but it sounds like the kind of thing that would be sort of fun
that's patently incorrect, i grew up in the country
we didn't have fucking bears, but i've handled my fair share of wild animals
silence, fool

now that's a quality edit
we do now i guess

that made me physically laugh, thank you misha
also literally every single time i say your name i end up thinking of that one scene from supernatural that was mega huge on tumblr
oh hey i found the original crappy tumblr gif
wait is that just a fucking image
i hate google
whatever, the gif/image is from an episode called "The French Twist" where it turns into a meta fuckfest that's actually somewhat interesting
noooooo, momo had no finishers for the qualifiers
terrible
why aren't we streaming this shit

that was great
haters gonna hate
<@!125433170047795200> triple LTD hotspots are being found, there's one a bit out of the way that i've parked my fleet carrier at
if you want to get into laser mining and make money even faster, i'll keep an eye out and let you know of any closer to good sell spots

i got this 40 minutes ago
thanks woc

what the fuck
i still need to play them all the way through
uh
i haven't tried realm grinder yet?
when did we talk about this
ahhhh
yeah no, i gave up on that
it was a bit too involved for my tastes

regalsin posting will never die
<@!125433170047795200> i hereby demand that you inject the linky command with all of those excerpts and give them a random chance to pop up
here's his profile picture and a thread with additional quotes for maximum enjoyment https://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=49294
i haven't seen this thread before and it's already paying off overwhelming dividends
```However some science like making a robotic leg, and arms is okay. Bringing back the dinosaurs is okay, keeping paper around is okay.

A car is only used dew to popularity. Has caused many deaths.```

i'm laughing so hard i physically cannot draw breath
holy fucking crap, i am losing my mind
regalsin was an internet anomaly
i wonder if he's still alive

`One pubic hair can pull even harder then the horns of a bull.`
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>"I never passed Homosexual 101"
i have never seen any of these quotes and almost all of them are killer
i was mostly joking before but now i kind of want a regalsin bot
```You just laughing since that post was unlogical. Now engage the borg at full speed....Jorde take us into hyper drive....you must deafeat metal gear or else Olga's child will die... blossums in feburay and migrates furrying spring```
i can't keep reading these, my throat hurts
i'm 100% convinced that regalsin is legit insane
there's no way someone can post in that manner so consistently unless it's for real
also where was this offer to drink and harass police officers when i still lived in virginia
you were holding out on me woc
yeah, fair enough
it was really inopportune timing
also i mean, i'm not suggesting you put ALL of the quotes in there
at the same time, maybe it's better not to venerate a possible child abuser
i would agree, but have one more
You know what, to hell with you all. I am too tired and too hot to have this redundant conversation to continue.
that's rather profound linkybot
i'll ask again later when you're not feeling so pensive
what's the matter
sex scenes are routinely uncomfortable and awkward for almost everyone involved
last of us II
not "last of us 2" but "last of us eye eye"
at least you have integrity
you advertised the roald dahl stream here too
we all watched it together
do you forget your own streams now
"guys after we finis havatar let's watch LOST hahthathahahaharahrahaghhhhhhfhhffh"
wow, what conversation is THAT from
aw, that's not as cool a conversation as i thought it would be
past me is completely correct though
i've only felt obligated to do that twice, but it's been interesting each time
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
it's perfect, frnakly
very sad
there's no way that score isn't inflated
i scrolled down to catch up with the conversation and i caught one brief snippet where someone said "sip" and it made me lose it
nah, that would be fun but it's not true unfortunately
wait, what game are we talking about stacking
oh, that could be fun
i only ever played campaign, which was a fucking 6 hour _blast_
i was just about to say "i don't have it" but i looked at my game list and apparently i do?
what the fuck
i need to investigate this
wait... what
what the fuck kind of business model is that
is bungie on crack or something
fucking hell, are they pushing microtransactions that hard
oh, it's DLC stuff
okay, that's better
well sure, i have never played destiny before but i'll load it up and maybe we can try it out next week
<@!207991389613457408> are you doing okay dude
charlie, you shouldn't have
look at them chompers
i mean, i'm not surprised by that idea
dogs and wolves shove their tongues into each others mouths as a sign of affection and/or submission
just makes sense that teeth can factor in too
does destiny 1 have a story worth playing for or is it bad/uninteresting/unnecessary enough that it doesn't matter
<@!125433170047795200> thanks for the heads up, i wasn't keeping track of price but i have 500 units ready to offload
time to MOVE THE CARRIER <:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
wrong ree but you get it
people have been complaining about this horribly unbalanced career for ages
but they have shown no signs of fixing it thus far, so...
i don't know how someone would possibly make enough money through other means if they wanted high dollar shit
exploration is great if you like that, but combat is completely, utterly profitless
oh yeah, i can give you my parts list if you want to outfit an anaconda for deep space travel
well, you're smart, you can figure it out actually
die, bitch
<:Korby:696746904989728839>
the fuck
yeah i kind of agree with that moon
i had literally zero motivation to get into combat until i had saved up several billion credits and grinded out arguably the best ship for it
all things considered, it's not... very well designed
the basic gameplay is pretty fun but it has some problems with making everything viable
i don't think we've actually tested that out
we were going to fight and then it just never happened
i'm jumping to cegreeth in 10 minutes, be there and we'll see how things shake out
i mean, you could totally be right, you have way more combat experience than i do
but it'll be nice to take achilles out for a spin
well get there idiot
i'm dumping my diamonds
<@!191265659936702464> i finally made it to the scott's tots episode of the office
<:ree:475542526791516170>
elite dangerous is fun, come play with us
join our squadron, use my fleet carrier
oh god, this episode
i have such dread in my heart
there's a lot in this show so far that has made me physically cringe
i've known this has been coming for a while but this is still just gut wrenching
i mean it's nine fucking seasons long
i've been watching it for hours each night and i'm only in the middle of the sixth
LMAO
I COMPLETELY FUCKING FORGOT ABOUT THE LAPTOP BATTERIES
<a:HowHyper:548406705352998923>
also, with each passing episode i hate dwight more and more
his schemes have gradually progressed from slightly idiotic and irritating to genuinely unethical bullshit
especially scheming to get jim fired from his job because he's like envious and upset that his constant asskissing didn't get the job for him
i just fucking hate him
it's not a fucking battleship, it handles like a brick but it flies like a bird
it's classed as a multirole but if you're not using it for exploration you're doing it wrong
YA WRONG, SON
whenever the fleet carrier jumps through hyperspace it sounds an alarm that sounds like three farts
ironically the beluga liner actually handles way better than the anaconda
oh, that could work
you are a wiener and you deserve death
you know, in retrospect the scott's tots episode wasn't so bad
i think this show has inured me a little bit to cringe humor
i was going to say, parks and rec is like a way more condensed version of this show
kind of the same flavor in a lot of respects and i'm not sure how much i appreciate that
but different enough that i can enjoy both
how... doesn't it work
are you saying what we do in the shadows is bad
(the movie not the tv show)
because that movie is fucking incredible
the tv show is decent but does not hold up to the movie at all
this feels like a strawman
i therefore rule your argument invalid
only a domestic dispute
move along
i was going to say honda as well
not sure why
niklink gets two sticks and a rock
and he has to share the rock with the rest of the platoon
no
do not post it
i love computers and computer parts, i should really try to apply some of that to learning about how cars work and how to fix them
no
in fact, you know what
i want to assemble a tiny go-kart sized automobile next
just so i can know all the individual parts that make a car work, at minimum
yeah
also <@!125433170047795200> i revel in this
see, i have no idea what a drive train is
this is why i should try and build an automobile
excellent contribution sozzay
you are a valued member of the company
an undeniable command
you must follow it
hey nostalgo
how may i help you today
go commit die
unironically though
doink is very likely the best euphemism for a joint i've ever heard
in my will i will stipulate that whoever delivers the eulogy will have to insert the phrase "too many doinks" somewhere
<@!167119512452202499> you played noita, you're very smart, and i trust you
what is the optimal straegy
i can't seem to get past the third floor anymore
oh
i end up spending most of my time trying to accrue explorative spells and picking up health when i can
i've also tried tunneling my way to the parallel worlds for more pickups and perks
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
i'm just bad at it
it used to be easier
no, it's much harder now
a cursed rock core was added to the barriers between worlds
it deals something like 20 damage per second when you touch it
chaotic polymorphine doesn't work anymore
ambrosia + tunneling with laser is the only way i've managed to make it work since the patch
well, that's basically what i've been doing
i guess this game is just harder than i give it credit for
i've just taken it for granted that i'm missing something obvious
i also can't seem to get good spell combos
i don't think i understand certain features of the spell system
i asked qweq and mines about this before but i'm still missing something
why so
hot damn
oh hey this was a nice find on the first floor
i had homing shots perk with a chain of large orbs and it was absurdly strong
one shot ended up killing most enemies in the hisii base
yeahhh
at first i thought it was fun and nice for exploration but it basically accomplishes nothing but self-harm and poop
can i say i hate that they added random enemy spawns with the orb of knowledge across the lava lake
sometimes it's completely trivial to avoid but then sometimes you get shit like this
oh jesus, yeah
i _can_ stream it's just kind of awkward
i'm living with my father and his wife while i seek employment and another place to live
thankfully the walls are thick here and noise does not travel far
i could probably get away with it provided i don't scream or any dumb bullshit like that
what kind of commentary are you thinking exactly
it'd be fun to have like a panel of people
you, mines, putnam maybe, gnawms
you could all say shit like "he might do this now which could have these benefits and drawbacks"
but unfortunately i do like to travel a lot when i play which would take up time
i don't stream noita specifically because i try to munchkin all the orbs of knowledge real quick and the walk time is huge
the idea makes me laugh, i might do it if you can find someone else willing to participate
i have no fucking idea what this is, still
somebody please explain
it's like a big monstrous phonogram
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
if this kills me i'm going to be upset
okay, it actually does play music
you may live
shut up multivac
you don't appreciate fine art
>worm doesn't have a complete change in tone like madoka does
okay, shut up
i think tori's argument is perfectly reasonable, you're just arguing minor details multi
the broadstrokes are pretty similar
no, don't put yourself down like that tori
you have to beat multi into submission
among the most stupid ways i've died in this god damn game
at some point i hit an acid flask and it was draining liquid
came back later and it said "empty flask"
picked it up
a huge cloud of acid appeared and instantly melted me
i'm not even mad, i'm just tired
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
I FUCKING HATE DYING IN THIS GAME
I SPEND SO MUCH TIME WALKING
AND THEN A FROG HITS ME
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
how is that even enforceable
needs more david bowie
now THAT is an absolute unit
oh, i was scrolled up
cringe, etc
what does my real voice sound like

perfection
everytime i'm reminded of comcast lying about the speeds they provide, i die inside just a little bit more
also yeah ghost story was fucking great

that's gonna have to do
i had it on in the background
at this point i'm not paying any attention

misfits will be better

i'm here in case any of you need a friend

it's not recommended for people under a certain age to drink caffeine

can you imagine being a pioneer
having to navigate shit that practically no one had navigated before
that sounds fucking awesome, if it weren't for the fairly high chance of death even with extensive experience and tools
do you guys know this for real or is this information obtained from the oregon trail
either way it's kind of morbidly hilarious
sometimes i think about going up to northern canada and mapping out some lakes or forests that no one has been to before
naming something
it would be a lot of work and probably dangerous but i also love the idea
i mean, i'm not going to go into this like fucking daniel boone
i'd probably use some kind of automobile and have a lot of modern technology to make sure i stay safe and can contact someone in an emergency
but nah i'm totally going to try and do that at some point once i save up some money
You bastards.
anyway, the coldest temperature i've been exposed to in the course of my work is liquid nitrogen, which is kept below 0196C or -320 F
the coldest temperature i was exposed to routinely was -80C in our storage freezer, which i kept all my samples in and cleaned out regularly
i almost got frostbite a few times when i neglected to put on gloves
the coldest weather i've been exposed to was -20C during a fucking horrible ice storm one year
that's extremely cold for missouri you fucking asshat
canadian ass motherfucker, get out of here you boastful prick
the average coldest temperature in kansas city in january is -6C

when the noita crew start talking let me know, i have an anecdote

Nearly two months

No, its whenever he can get updates out
I know, I'm itching for it too
We're getting close to the end and I can't wait to see how the story concludes
He's gonna join the party, obviously
Duuuuuuh
what's the best tower defense game
i haven't played one for ages
smash mouth please eat the eggs
there's only 24 that we know of
is... is that not a 3d model
that doesn't look like a real person

i downloaded this file back in 2014
i'm pretty sure the forum i found it on now is completely gone form the internet
thanks woc, very cool
no u
i somehow have managed to avoid looking at the words
i love peripheral viusion
is sony still trying to DMCA this shit
yeah, i hate it
but i'll play it with other people
the white skittles for pride month thing is them trying to like
take the skittles rainbow and say they're giving it to LGBT people
it's an extremely weird, hamfisted message that's super confusing
yeah, that's why it sucks dick
needs more sauce
well
that's feasibly interesting
holy fucking shit, this is by far the best run i've had in a long time <@!213413608732884994>

yeah
i got polymorphed and then suffocated in powder instantaneously
took all of the wind out of my sails
i'm probably not going to have another session like that in like a month
guess i'll try again another day
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
holy shit, "habeeb it" has not entered my mind for a very long time
i didn't even realize that majesty was missing from my life
<@!168980988477702145> HABEEB IT
can you fucking believe that habeeb it is 15 years old
man
i just saw the episode of the office where ||michael leaves to go live with holly in colorado||
i hate his character, i think he's a narcissistic asshole
so why did that episode get me so hard
wait
oh god, that phrasing is terrible
nevermind, all of the melancholy is gone
fuck it, it's a slow night
<@!213413608732884994> you haven't seen FGF? looks like we need to watch it again
right now let's go
no you fucking dingus it's 1 AM
hi tera, i'm dad
see? it's perfect
there's a couple extremely good ones
undoubtedly the best thing woc has ever done
yeah, it was time
linkybot will return, but not for tonight
spamweasel is a great term
i need to do more like that
something story driven i've never played before
especially now that i've tuned my setup so that my audio quality doesn't sound like shit and the bitrate is better on everything
i have never played fire emblem for more than 30 minutes
is it a good story???
i got the impression it was mechanically driven
you know what
tensei, ghost trick was your suggestion
and it turned out great
are you seriously recommending persona 4 golden
well, i trust your judgement
even if not p4g, let me know what you think would be a good idea
it'd be nice to have something like ghost trick again
but i 100%ed world of goo
and the people who suffered the most was the audience
how soon you forget, my child
i've played cave story before, but only once and it was like six years ago i think
and i only beat the most basic ending (?)
i basically remember nothing about that game besides a nice gun i liked a lot
what
i am so lost
i have never played a persona game, i have no idea what they're about
i have no idea what that is at all
it sounds interesting though, what kind of game is it
o-oh
okay, i'll look into it
then why is it 30 dollars
how about we make a little wager? say... thirty dollars?
what the hell is d4
oh dear god
alright, let me see here
only 15 bucks, that's doable
these graphics are horrifying, i already like it
alright, sure
i'll stream this game
don't worry, i'll hold off for now
oh, i have a friend who's playing deadly premonition right now
i wouldn't be averse to playing it but the sheer batshit insanity of it is kind of ruined for me
i've seen too much already
maybe in the future i'll look at that too
we'll see
that one's a bit too abstract for my taste, but definitely an impressive iteration
<:SHIALABEOUF:532559243270946816>
i want to stay up and keep talking but i have a lot of shit to take care of tomorrow
no good night posting
LEARN YOUR FUCKING PLACE, TRASH
<:paindisgust:439242912069320704>
juneteenth is june 19th and celebrates the day that slavery was officially abolished in the US
oh
yeah, no, slavery had been officially abolished about two and a half years before juneteenth
it was apparently the emancipation of the last slaves in america
i don't think congress as a whole is responsible for validation of the results of the executive election, it's a branch affair
if trump loses the election then he's no longer vested with the powers of the office, and so the secret service don't serve him anymore and he loses control of the armed forces
it doesn't matter if he acknowledges the results or not
if he simply refuses to leave the white house, then i'm pretty sure he'll get forcibly removed by secret service or whatever
if he tries to nullify the results of the election, then that doesn't magically make him the winner, he still loses his vested powers
there will simply be no new president, at which point the powers of presidency pass to the leader of the house
which means it'd be pelosi
<@!111477124384202752> you are very off now
50 pounds in one hand was straining my joints really bad and making my arms sore, so i'm back down to 30 and just trying to improve form
it's going much better actually
pretty sure, yeah
spoops
If that's true then I can't in good conscience support the books, that would be uniquely terrible
Not unless the website becomes totally unusable
Wouldn't buying the books incentivize letting the website fall further into ruin
Not really, it also applies in the case of laziness
"We haven't bothered fixing the website but they're still buying our stuff. Just let it rot I guess"
When a small group of us could probably get the comic back up and running in like less than a month, then I'm not sure that the distinction between apathy or ignorance matters
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
I think the concept of the kids story is too simple for what tensei's describing
Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is at least slightly fantastic in nature, he wants something rigid and dystopic in tone
Food in various forms, yeah
All dose people
All dat molasses
<:FaskyThinking:295351108086530049>
But have you considered: yes?
What the fuck is cookie clicker's "end game"
We need occultpunk
I mean, it's called idle for a reason
I don't want to be actively engaged with an idle game
Cookie clicker really is the best idle game in some ways
I just wish the numbers went higher
The endgame for adventure capitalist is over a centillion
I don't remember how many zeroes a centillion is, its just a lot
300 zeroes, my god

NONE OF YOU ARE SAFE
Well, at least he isn't insulting the base for disagreeing with him yet
They haven't crossed that line so they're doing pretty good
That's disappointing to hear
HABEEB IT
yeah, but for those 6 out of 10 it's totally worth it
i am exhausted, what have i missed today
jesus christ that's horrifying
on the one hand, i really hate how simplistic meme formats can cut through the chance to create and engage in interesting/constructive
oh for fuck's sake
i hit the enter key
someone fucking stab me in the gut tonight
i was GOING TO SAY that i hate how they can undercut something nice, but the reverse side of that coin is cutting through inane bullshit
i was impressed at how hard it was to watch attack of the clones again
that movie is a fucking _slog_
I SLAUGHTERED THEM LIKE ANIMALS
NOT JUST THE MEN, BUT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN TOO
I HATE THEM
bingies
i mean, i'm mostly here
what can i do for you my son
you all have one hour
that is correct
you ever heard the phrase ignorance is bliss
idiot
i really need to stop breaking my sentences up
she... is... "she"
it's been years since i originally watched "spencer launches a bagel into griffin's rectum" and it STILL makes me laugh when "for 'till cock" happens
at some point sure
make sure you guys agree on a proper day and then tell me ahead of time
it's not, really
it's really hard to discuss things that actively factor in things like moral relativism
is there a way to counter this
unacceptable, utilitarianism sucks
i put forth the idea of disregarding ethics and morality
the hour is up
also, i'm late, but i watched a little of that rally
1) the stadium was about 1/3rds full at best, i think they had between 2000-5000 people attending in a theater built for 20,000 people
which is hilariously pitiful
2) i saw the snippet where he referenced the glass of water thing
i'm used to trump being incomprehensible and petty but that brought it almost to the point of absurdity
he started making excuses about how he drank it that way because the water gets on his tie otherwise
and then when he got finished drinking it he was like "that's right" and the crowd started cheering
it was seriously like taking a peek into bizarro world
yeah, i often feel scummo gets overlooked in the current political climate
sorry you guys are saddled with that shit
we need more regional managers
doesn't it all just make you tired
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME TO DOOOOOOO
CAN YOU FEEL THE SUNSHINE TOOOOOOOOOOO
this is one of those weird nights where i keep feeling nostalgic and wistful for stuff that both has and has not existed
i keep getting really intense flashes of the first time i read homestuck and other stories that i can't remember are real or not
yes, precisely
i'm no longer sure if king david happened to me or if that was a story
i need a heavy dose of reality
"fake it 'till you make it" is frequently associated with stuff like this
depends on who's looking
some people are into that
<:jerry:568521849714245665> what the fuck just happened
i don't think saying "i'm a queen" or whatever is that bad by itself
it's when it's paired with actually impactful negative personality traits/choices
like constantly asking people to venmo you cash
KISSIN' THE HOMIES GOODNIGHT
that's a meme i have not seen in a very long time
yeah, precisely
```drew just doesnt start convos``` <:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
this isn't through anything purposeful on my part, i'm just not sure when to start discussions or how
i would love to start more conversations but i'm bad at working people up into it
if only life were so grand
we need more extravagant weaponry
that tank reminds me of a unit from like a star wars game or some shit
this piece of garbage https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/IG-227_Hailfire-class_droid_tank
it's probably for the best that megaweapons/armor like that wasn't really effective or feasible
i can't help but feel a little wistful for a world where that's not the case though
'e bought?
MARBLE
LEAGUE
it's a shame that the events happen at the same time as now
o r a ?
get your FACTS straight
ree...
wat
X
ask and ye shall receive
yeah, you fucked up hard
what a weird year it's been so far
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321> is the emote of the year
which one was that
please no
my heart couldn't take it
because we can't pump up "what is love" to 150 decibels and dance to it on the plane
idiot
SCRAM, WIZARD
this is very interesting news
i do agree that homestuck twitter has seemed better though
i don't actually know that, i literally never check twitter
what do you mean
i'm not really sure what you're implying qweq
are you saying this is bad for homestuck?
homestuck is already dead
you know, sure, i can agree with that multivac
but you know what? if this is what's happening maybe that's not so bad
clearly the comic is not going in a good direction right now, perhaps this will be a hard reset of some sort
i hope aysha isn't affected by this honestly, and if she stays on she'll be able to employ greater discretion about who gets on the team
i'm not sure how the current team even got selected, maybe she's the one who chose them this time too
either way, i don't know
isn't it all so tiresome
was that confirmed
i remember seeing some confusion
thank you gnawms
FIFTY
TWO
DAYS
fucking halo ce had colorblind mode i think
i die
real life is stranger than fiction
ultra based
how many times can we say based in an hour
so kush
i think i'm steadily losing my ability to think rationally about things
i keep wanting to vomit up random phrases or ideas that come to mind with no prelude or explanation
I'M ALIVE; I'M BOOOOOOORN
ANTS
_ANTS_
___ANTS___
imagine rating decades by poops
or vice revers
excuse me
do you want to see my resume
i don't like your attitude, mister
demodded
i would much rather go to alaska than utah
emptiness is okay sometimes
what was your question
i'm sorry, could you speak up? i'm a trifle deaf in this ear
in seriousness, what kind of isekai are we talking about
like, is this typical "you have greater skill than other people"
or is it just getting inserted into another world and nothing else
death
if i'm just getting inserted into the world and nothing else
uhh
a generic utopia??
no
unironically i think i'd want to be put into the elite dangerous setting
having easy access to literal starships and regularly exploring the galaxy
shit's great
less than 10 times probably
well, hm
okay, two things
1) i append my answer to any universe where i can learn to do magic and it's really cool
2) i've probably died around a dozen times, i sometimes try to fight things and i usually lose
but i can count the number of times i've died outside of combat on one hand
nat shut up you fucking soda gremlin
why are you so jealous of my success
<:bred:684981349311971339>
andrew are we talking about literally any universe we want or is it an existing idea
if it's literally any universe we want then of course i'd want to live in a perfect utopia with immortality
it's a fucking no brainer
it's way more interesting to ask about existing fictional concepts
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
i need to write a spat entry where i singlehandedly describe how fucking weird andrew is
we need x
you're thinking of those store bought tubes of cinnamon rolls you bake in an oven, right
i like those tube cinnamon rolls, not gonna lie
but andrew is correct, the cinnamon might as well not actually be there
it's all in the icing
things i like that actually taste like cinnamon include hot pretzels
collector limpet expired
god, damn
i'm impressed with the office's ability to humanized people i despised
nellie the british chick was fucking disgusting but i actually felt happy for her getting those adoption papers signed
what the fuck is going on with this writing
i'm watching it for the first time
it's the same reason anything can be interesting
character driven
you can take the most mundane shit and make it interesting with good character work
if you can make people care about a fake person then you're set
yeah nat
all 12 of my readers would beg to differ
you FUCK
yeah, unfortunately scott adams is a fucking kook
has he said anything about the whole pandemic situation
or has he gone dark in utter shame of his foolishness
holy fucking shit <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
where was that picture taken
jesus fucking christ
this is wrong but it's so amusing
god damn it, i keep dying
i just
why is noita so hard <:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
you got it
ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
is death off the table
blood makes up approximately 7% of the human body's weight
the threshold for blackouts varies from person to person but it's generally pegged at a BAC of 0.30, which means 30% of 7%, which corresponds to 2.1%
which for a 170 pound human would be 3.57 pounds?
this calculation doesn't make any sense
i'm pretty sure 3.57 pounds of alcohol weould fucking murder you
oh yeah, that makes FAR more sense
i'm so used to multiplying decimals by 100 to get percentage that my brain just took it for granted
i need to redo the calculation, the current result i'm getting is about 0.57 ounces which seems too low
why is alcohol so difficult
i guess pure alcohol would make sense
i was thinking of distilled spirits
yeah, see
shit's complicated
i can't believe this is what we talked about tonight
<@!118843634652020736> incest is actually an allowed topic, but only in the serious channel
you were openly arguing in defense of incest in the homestuck channel
not appropriate there
also i extended your ban because you said "cop" when tipsy DMed you about it
not sure i want someone like you around who complains about being treated like a child when you act like one
do you have any other questions

ez lyfe
it's complicated smeevs
optimally, i would like to allow kate conversations to proceed fully
but in the past that's led to some extremely undesirable behavior
like people talking about bodily threats of harm and shit
less severe cases include people just harping on it for hours
i think it's a per diem thing
i think that's a reasonable way to treat on it
no, i haven't had any contact with the official team in a while
i'm not privy to any of what they do
real how
i mean
you're right in that the messages the account screenshotted did in fact get sent, but they were edited out of order
it was presented in a way that it outright manufactured evidence of things that weren't happening
the hscommwatch account was created by someone named phoebe in an explicit attempt to stir up animosity between us and WP
this was a serious point of discussion between me and andrew hussie
we have screenshots of phoebe literally saying "i'm going to get both makin and kate in serious trouble," it was honestly some disgusting shit
yeah, phoebe is a real piece of shit
phoebe was trying to schmooze her way onto the official team for months even after shit went down
i shouldn't speak too much about it, it makes me mad just thinking about it
what a waste of time and energy
no jokes, only vitriol
it's not a big deal at this point smeevs
i think things have mostly moved on
i hate that it turned out this way, but it could probably have gone a lot worse too
homestuck fandom has an extensive history of drama
it's honestly part of the appeal to me at this point
just not when i'm part of it
some of it is bad
not all of it though
if you're unironically interested in reading about it, i've been writing an extensive document that covered a lot of the happenings here and elsewhere in the fandom
<:wackyZany:230072349431431169>
enjoy https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/SPATfrontcover.html
i still don't know if that rumor is substantiated or not
kate leaving
yeah, i can't read that
but i assume because you're linking to it, it's a real post
which, fair enough
i did not know that
"generally brusque" is a very polite way of putting it
i still feel very strongly about this but there's really not much to be gained in me hashing it out anymore i think
latula, the two things you're talking about aren't really comparable
she accused the subreddit and discord, and especially the mod team, of being a childporn ring
the most we accuse her of is being openly antagonistic with the fandom, which is demonstrably true
oh, i guess we also say we don't like the stuff she writes, but even that's not true most of the time
i actually kind of liked the vriska pesterquest episode
just kind of hard to appreciate her work when she has this openly adversarial mindset with just about anyone who doesn't totally agree with her
weren't you like, gone for most of that
that's what i meant
but either way, we got rid of hornyposting for a reason
makin never liked it in the first place but let it stay by popular demand
as soon as people started becoming affected by it adversely, that shit was out
and then the debacle with ceru mutinying and taking the nsfw server happened, and now we've fully disavowed from NSFW content here
it's for the best, we have a lot of younger people here
smeevs, kate identifies _really hard_ with vriska
for various reasons
we're pretty sure that was unironic
ah, this conversation again
latula, i'm not totally convinced by what you're saying because it contradicts with stuff i saw back when those tweets were publicly viewable
it's pretty hard to verify now because kate deleted fucking everything she posted that became controversial
but there are also other instances where she pretty openly trashed tavros, or was at least tangential to that idea
okay
so by your own admission, i feel like your defense of her is splitting hairs more than anything
it's one thing to say that a specific point of evidence against her is false, far be it from me to say that we should accuse her of stuff that isn't true
but there's all this other shit that happened which is basically the exact same thing
it's not like when she accused us of harboring child abusers, because that was a huge pile of bullshit regardless of everything
sure, she didn't say that one thing
but she also said all this other shit that was the same thing
it was pretty much the same thing
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
you can't be serious
yeah, don't start being casually insulting
obviously i'm not a fan of kate but i'm not going to insult her intelligence or sanity
i've always found that kind of reasoning annoying, disliking a character because of stuff out of universe
i hate vriska but it's not because of vriska fans
who cares, like or dislike or be ambivalent about a character all you want
i'm just saying that basing your opinion of a character on non-diegetic things is kind of dumb
apparently you do care about tavros, because you just said you hate him because of the way certain fans idolize him
so which one is it
sorry mimi, we're embroiled in HOT TAKES
it's been a while since we dropped a spicy keychain in here
it feels good to be back on this bullshit, not gonna lie
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
no, i'm chill as a cucumber over here
shut up, wiener
god damn, i just got fucking roasted by my own robot clone
trauma is a very strange thing
i would rather cut my right hand off
sure andrew, just make me look like my online avatar
no real face bullshit
unless it's <:bred:684981349311971339>
i'll always allow <:bred:684981349311971339>
i've always maintained that cronus is a bitch ass motherfucker
<:drewBitch:667945916128559125>
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
always comparing me to dunkey, god damn it
it's not that bad of a thing by itself
it's just that you say it so often it gets annoying
say something more original and entertaining than "you look like dunkey haha lel"
is that supposed to make me feel better
i value our relationship cyrene
never leave
or else
üî™
this is how gen should always be
i need to come in here more often and stoke the flames of fandom
it's always fun, i'm just bad at provoking conversations
hey maybe we should `shut the fuck up` again
my last shower was like five hours ago
w-why
hey everyone, drew linky here
i'm the owner of the hsd and homestuck subreddit, AMA until i need to go take a piss
not soon enough
my social securty numeber is 123-456-7890
also generally more of a tits man but ass is also nice
my favorite homestuck ships are all of the worst ones
take that as you will
okay, fine, i'll give you one example
in my top three: liv tyler x one of the cans of shaving cream that was in dad egbert's wallet
aradia megido is honestly great, although she's kind of a weirdo
if we're speaking unironically i think that my favorite troll is probably kanaya, she seems like she's easiest to get along with
~~also she was the troll i impersonated when we did april fool's last year~~
i felt like that went pretty well
what was our prank in 2019
no, get fucked idiot
i don't remember this art
oh, hm
i don't know, i wouldn't talk about it though
i met oD in real life at magfest a couple years ago, stayed at an airbnb with them and a few other people
it was fun talking to them but i don't think things would be good at this point
they were chill, yeah
although they got _really_ into talking about classpects
i've never been a fan of their like theories on shit
all of the videos i've seen by oD have come across to me as really fast and loose with the logic, and the connections were always reaching
but that's just my opinion
post the kanaya as well i guess
unbelievable
i don't know, i'd hang it up on the fridge
whatever the reasoning, it sucks
it's an extremely surface level joke, and it's a dumb abuse of jade's character to boot
i liked the epilogues a lot and hate homestuck 2 so much that its singlehandedly made me give up on this franchise
we should try and get a new server image
in the top left there
maybe i can hold a suggestion box for it
i was thinking of existing works
i do want something with at least all of the beta kids in it
the image we've got now is nice because of the number of characters
not a lot of that stuff though
also literally 0%
not only because of the political landscape of the fandom but also why the actual hell would i want to inherit that mess
i've already got my hands full with this one
things have been getting established for over half a year now
the pace has been wack as hell
i've been reading since 2012
i'm here to bullshit and party, and i'm all out of bovine feces
an arms rep, never thought i'd see that
is the direct still going??
sad
_you_ look so much worse
also post screenshots
that screams to me of the team trying out a more retro style
a la shovel knight
why does this video make me feel so strange

not my fault carl
i didn't delete them, youtube did
i can't recover those videos because the email associated with the account is completely gone
<@!266807632390520833> i haven't always been like i am now
also the internet itself was pretty different back in the early 2010s
they're talking about "bachelor life" on the office and andy says this: `Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.`
i've unironically had nights like this and i'm not sure how i feel about that
i do, it's just easier to eat it over the sink
saves time
i don't have a tv
it would help if you knew the layout of my previous apartment
it was kind of like a studio apartment where everything was in one room
>eating pizza with a knife and fork
what in the actual fuck
also i didn't own a table
excuse you, i kept my apartment very clean
yeah, i slept in the corner in a pile of newspapers
i fed the rats my scraps and befriended them
they whispered things to me
i think you guys are making a lot of assumptions
i had plenty of stuff in the apartment
i just hate tv so i didn't own one
well, that's not true
i bought a small 100 dollar TV and put it in the living room for when i had guests
i just never used it myself
i also had a foldout table but i never used it unless i had guests over for drinking games
background noise, or play music from it
why not just hook up a laptop or something to your tv
HDMI cable, yada
<:pathetic:431861336943886336>

what's wrong with you
replace those with names and we'll talk

thanks tensei
i'm not very robust
<@!168980988477702145> HABEEB IT
alright, so
you people who watch me stream are going to be upset
but i'm considering doing ocarina of time randomizer again
HOWEVER, with a twist this time
nights, the crazy bastard, figured out how to do randomized multiplayer
so she would be on call with me and we'd be playing together
sorry nights wanted me to say "a friend" instead of naming her
so i will be playing with *spaghettiEater94
too soft

<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
yeah, truly my methods cannot be trashed
i forgot the word "denigrate"
shut up, wiener
<@!111477124384202752> <@!266807632390520833> who else, i always forget who watches me play dumb shit
nights is busy for a second, we'll be getting on voice soon and then starting up
i'll post the link when we go live
i'm excited, this is going to be stupid
drink less milk you stupid idiot
i'll kill you myself
yes
alright we're starting soon
also what the fuck are you people DOING
<@!207991389613457408> it's too explicit, we're not allowing that
less explicit gachi memes are fine
<@!168980988477702145> it's not porn either, you fucking wiener
it's just got nudity in it
it would be porn if i was watching it to jack off, otherwise it's just a meme
GET YOUR _FACTS_ STRAIGHT
no, plebs stay off for a bit
i'm starting the stream as soon as nights figures out her microphone and we test audio levels a bit
fine, you have until we start
misha what the fuck is your deal
i told you i'm not allowing that video
we can hash out the particulars later
just get rid of it for now
I LITERALLY
WENT
AND CHECKED YOUR FUCKING VIDEO
THE RACING ONE, YES
THE ONE WHERE IT'S TWO NAKED MEN RIDING EACH OTHER LIKE A FUCKING MOTORCYCLE?
IS THAT THE ONE?
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
DELETE IT FOR NOW
i'm not actually mad, i just need you to fucking listen to what i am saying
i don't care if it's against what we talked about, for now, i am telling you to delete it
listen to what i'm saying or we're going to have a problem
that was great
<@!111477124384202752> nights has asked me not to put vods of this run through up, so you'll need to watch it now or forever perish
quality content
we're gonna stream again tomorrow morning, good for euros
that was a lot of fun, it got a little dull near the end though because we stopped making jokes
learning more and more about how to be a good streamer
too bad i'll never put any of that to use
they pinch back
only 11 more months until we can watch robot again
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
sigh
i guess i should
destiny 2 or DOS2
sure then, i have it downloaded
you and misha ready to play it too?
let me know when he stops sooning
andrew, i can't get this thing to go
i press play to enter and then it's stuck on basically a blank screen forever
jesus fucking christ
i think i got through the intro?
took off in a ship
hold on, going through some cutscene
i am not enjoying destiny 2 so far
i never played destiny 1, i didn't know what to expect
this is just kind of whatever so far
it might not help that i'm actually not really in the mood for it right now anyway
props to andrew and veli for inviting to play with them
but that was kind of awful
i only played destiny 2 for like an hour and a half but i think i kind of hate it
is there an expectation of you to play destiny 1 before playing destiny 2
or are they functionally separate games
that's terrible
i had no fucking idea what i was doing at any point or why
the gunplay was kind of boilerplate but also lacked a lot of weight, the arenas we played in didn't feel very structured
i don't mean weight as in damage
i mean weight as in it didn't feel like there was a lot of responsiveness to me shooting my guns or how it affected enemies
i had a shotgun and rocket launcher
i don't mean damage output you fucking troglodyte
i mean that the gameplay didn't have any real oomph to it
it felt like i was supposed to care about what was going on but i was thrust into the middle of everything with basically no prior explanation
i didn't know who anyone was or what we were doing besides "kill aliens"
wow, i just
bungie, what are you fucking doing
this is awful
go back to doing shit like halo
<:punctuation:305073440975486976>
i really wanted to enjoy it but there was just so much even in the first hour that i was like "this can't be real"
what a fucking horrible design

i almost never do this
that's another thing
i got like a taste of something i kind of enjoyed with the environments
i mentioned before that it's aimless, that's not necessarily true
there was a lot of stuff that kind of subtly hinted at exploration
like i found a balcony that had a ton of openings on it so i could get higher and higher
but then i got to the top and there was fucking nothing there
and then when you take a step back the maps seem kind of open world but they're not really, it's a bunch of tight hallways that lead to battlefields
that design kind of pissed me off
there are better ways to design maps and do loading that doesn't involve completely stupid/contrived maps
do you know how many open world games there are that can load huge environments without problems
this isn't a question of me coming up with a concrete design
this is me stating that the concept is dumb and there are a billion games that do it way better
i uh
i don't give a single shit about whatever content you're talking about
are you talking about like the graphics or something?
who the hell cares about that?
i just don't understand the argument
describe what content you mean
do you mean textures or something else
yes, i recognize that mines
and there are a lot of ways that games have found out to load huge areas
i'm saying that the way destiny 2 does it, from what i saw, was kind of annoying and didn't do it for me
and the reason it didn't do it for me is because there are better ways of designing your open world maps that don't rely on contrived, twisty hallways so you can render a ton of assets that bloat your file size
there are probably way more efficient ways that it could have been handled
gnawms, it fucking sucked
you are gay
end of story
are we still talking about destiny 2
i recognize none of these names
you all worship trash
gnawms, i'm still puzzled by your argument
i know i'm arguing disingenuously, but really
like, take a step back
i'm saying the maps didn't need to be designed that way
you're saying that they did, because of the assets?
but there are other games that have just as much detail implemented that don't rely on that kind of loading scheme
red dead redemption 2
and it looks great
so are you saying that the textures and other asset details in destiny 2 are mostly individually crafted or something
yes, but it allows for a different kind of design that i feel would have helped the exploration aspect a lot
i almost enjoyed exploring in destiny 2 for a bit but i immediately felt like the way the map worked was confining and didn't actually make it conducive to exploration
what is "this type of game development"
i don't understand what that means
alright, and my question is why would they choose to do it that way
alright, so it's a matter of how the game works on a fundamental level
okay, sure
that doesn't change my opinion at all, i fundamentally did not like how the game works
this is interesting to learn though
alright, don't be a dick about it
like i said last night, i'm not a fan of kate either but i'm not going to be a prick about her stepping down
so cool your jets
i mean, i would beleive it
she's extremely engaged in the protests happening right now, and that's completely understandable
so i wouldn't be surprised if that's why she decided to step down, but there's really no point in wondering about it overly much
also yes of course we're shutting down those kinds of posts
pettiness is unsavory
even if we all engage in it from time to time
no moon, i think it was just a preemptive question
we might want to keep an eye on the general and homestuck channels though
you're a pizza
a pizza shit
yeah, you'd think people wouldn't do that but i'm pretty sure every state has towns in it that are named after other states
definitely musk
that guy has weeb written all over him
no idea, but i've never seen it so i'm down to give it a try
that's the medical comedy right
needs more spice
<:picardpalm:431649692573630484>
perfection
i think other people have already compiled lists like that
i would definitely link to one of those though, it's definitely an im
oh
you mean of like, events in the server
i thought you meant the homestuck fandom as a whole
man, where to even fucking begin though
just finished the office
i've always thought that the office's fame on the internet was overdone, and i still kind of think that
now i understand a lot more why people like it though
it definitely won me over at least
don't yell at the dog, i'm sure he's a good boy
explain yourself
i don't know what a fumble dimension is
i haven't looked at anything by jon bois besides 17776
i'm not very good at looking at other material authors have made
haven't done it for wildbow or alexander wales either
well, seeing as i literally just finished a 9 season long show, i'm up to trying something new
link me to the poker episode
<@!125433170047795200> wow...
that was pretty good
it doesn't make me want to watch the rest of them though
not sure why, it was perfectly entertaining
this is really serious, wow
anyone who's so cavalier about "having enemies" is probably worthy of concern
i hope this mess is resolved amicably and scott can get back to writing
i don't agree with that at all
it's not possible to say "he's already boned" because it's not a black and white thing
it's based on chance
there's a not insignificant chance that someone already knows his real identity, but it's way more likely that anyone who does is a completely neutral actor who has no investment in this
it
it totally could help though, as a form of protest against the article coming out about him
it could completely nullify the NYT's article and prevent them from releasing it
that would do the job pretty fucking well in my opinion
not necessarily, protesting is usually more about a means to an end
sometimes gaining attention is the goal
sometimes the goal is to invalidate someone else's work
this time it's the latter
wait what
no, i've been pretty bad about keeping up
unwinnable for wayback or the authors
this feels like a very stupid move on wayback's part
wayback isn't particularly profitable anyway, i don't imagine
what were the people in charge of the website thinking, this is ridiculous
i mean, it is pretty interesting in a niche sense
i mean, there's two possibilities here
0hp is a mentally stable individual who genuinely holds those opinions, which would be truly horrific
or, he is a mentally unstable individual who genuinely holds those opinions, which would be truly tragic
either one fucking sucks
who's assuming people we disagree with are ill
i have really not been doing spat any justice lately
i have no energy for more
see, that's the thing though
i used to be happy enough to write about banalities
i catch most of the highlights just fine now, but sometimes the devil's in the details
even the boring ones
maybe especially the boring ones
i need to get my mojo back somehow
devils like that screenshot
those are the banalities that happen on this server, and most of them just disappear without a trace
i suppose not jamie
and yet, sometimes it would be nice to have a record of even the tiny things
maybe not always, but at least once or twice
i would give anything to have a description of a day in the life of a bronze age human
i like this compromise, i think i'll do just that
we need to write a screenplay
it's still going technically
started in july 2017, entries became less frequent july of last year
but still being updated whenever i feel like it, yeah
that's what you get for complaining
and for talking about getting into spat
we don't take too kindly to spatbait 'round these parts
someone brought up the idea of creating a simplified HSD timeline
i would love some help with that, considering how shit my memory is
we'll talk about it tomorrow maybe andrew
for now i die
just a heads up, nights and i are going to continue streaming at about 2 PM EST, so like an horu and ten minutes from now
you wish, baby
Makin has always had some sort of weird prejudice against media intended for younger people
daily remindarr 2 stay hidrayted ty bye
alright we're almost ready to stream
i hope you guys are ready for heavy and tiny
>look in the rearview mirror
>see humanity
>drive even faster
yeah i just need to stop eating so much crap and start drinking protein shakes
then i can get swole and start beating hapless passersby without contest
alright sorry, we had some technical difficulties

run might be dead
we'll try again tomorrow
good rat
honestly, why is that story in the bible at all
is it just a parable about not making fun of people
feels kind of pointed that he "called a curse down on them in the name of the `Lord`"
well, no, i haven't
because part of the 10 commandments is that you're not supposed to take god's name in vain
and also there's that whole thing about love thy neighbor

what do you mean by the letter
cartoons we need to stream: spongebob seasons 1-4, ed edd n eddy
any other suggestions
hmm
it has been a very long time since i saw ben 10
i don't think i even saw it finish its original airing, actually
i have no idea how the first show ends
tubular
DOOOOOWN IN NEEWW ORLEANS
i don't, but this is cute so i don't know how i could possibly complain
i didn't know they were doing a demon's souls remake, that's very exciting
i've never played it and have been sorely missing out on having a new fromsoft game, that'll do nicely
anyone know when it's supposed to come out or is that TBD
eldenring
i misspoke, it's a remaster, not a remake
althouogh if it's anything like dark souls remastered then that doesn't really matter, it won't be good

i can't believe we live in a world where bone-in pizza is real
i could probably toss it up here, is it out now
hm
sure, i can put it up if people want
get a list of people
it turns out hardcore mode minecraft is a very difficult thing to get people interested in on a regular basis

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
time for a trip to east world if i can find some fucking ambrosia
i'm picking up as many max health upgrades as i can, replenishing, and then perk hunting
good dog
best friend
this round of noita is very monkas
i'm being as careful as humanly possible
i have over 300 health and there's a max HP perk, i haven't gone to the dark caves yet

so fucking angry right now
we know you do carl
we know you do
that's right! doug dimmadome, owner of the dimmsdale dimmadome!
that does it
we need to stream fairly oddparents
die

link me to that tera i need to view it
I NEED IT
I'M SO FUCKING PISSED ABOUT NOITA REEEEEEEEEE
so what
it's great
what are you, a pussy
pathetic
time for my monthly viewing of celery man
`good morning paul. what will your first sequence of the day be?`
i think i'm starting to feel true frustration over the lack of anything truly exciting coming up
i haven't had real passion or interest in most works i've encountered since homestuck, and it feels like there's a big hole in my experiential awareness because of that
no fandom-worthy things i've been aware of
i really like WTC but it's not updating fast enough to scratch the itch
i increasingly want to know what THE NEXT BIG THING is
even if just on a personal level
starting to CHAFE
they're distinct concepts
you can have good media and you can also have fandom for stuff that isn't good media necessarily
it's more about the excitement and fever pitch of being involved in something that really speaks to you, and especially if other people are involved oto
good point nik, somehow i keep forgetting that this is quite likely one of the worst years of our lives
why does no one else understand this
i feel like being mean tonight, which is a kind of weird desire that i don't enjoy knowing i' mfeeling
OH, SHIT
i'm okay
now _tayne_ i can get into
we are the burg
tell your sister matilda to get in the kitchen and make some borglars with you, jeeb.
really feeling plok beach right now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gpu1GHRymY
yes
you know
i thought i was fucking crazy, but the song actually slows down in pace after the first rendition
skip from about 2:30 back to the beginning
the synthesizer sounds make me think of like old 90s and early 2000s videos that were just demonstrations of 3D modeling software where it was super trippy and full of weird geometric objects
fuck you skubs
truly pathetic
wait what
what weeaboo comic
ah, that one
good shit
alright, i don't want that on my screen for the next however many minutes
<:loss_jpg:354791933375152129>
<@!125433170047795200> i've settled on my course of action
i haven't left the bubble yet, i've been gathering LTD and am going to sell them off once i reach enough to make ~8 billion in profit
roughly 650 million of that is going towards tritium until my carrier is completely full storage with it, then the remaining money will be used for maintenance costs
by my calculations, 5 years of maintenance will cost about 7.2 billion credits
i'll be able to maintain with relative ease by exploration once i'm out in deep space
and there'll be a permanent outpost in xibalba for any who happen to be exploring in the region
i am though, it's a nice thought
i've renamed the carrier to reflect its eventual purpose: Scylax Outpost

wait, is there a teaser for halo infinite
i'm reminded of the whole tulpae thing
i actually spent an unbelievable amount of time around people who genuinely, wholly, unironically believed that tulpae were real, and a bunch of derivative supernatural stuff alongside it
it felt kind of weird at the time, but especially in retrospect i'm kind of horrified by the fact that people like that are out there
yes, there were a lot of MLP fetishists there
<@!178187098929496064> yeah no, people who believe in tulpae attempt to "manifest" figments of their imagination so that they're deluding themselves into "seeing" those entities actually existing around them
there was a literal guide for the group i was around
it's possible that some of them literally managed to start hallucinating what they were thinking? maybe?? but in general it was just people being fucking crazy and pretending to see things, reinforcing each other through group think
it was incredibly disturbing
if you're interested in INTERNET HISTORY

i see shit from ik_ihe way less on /r/all
wait, what's going on even
yeah
i was busy eating and becoming FAT
really? yawn
i hope it dies
i would be more than willing to play that
i just hate playing mobas in general
meme matches though? good shit, especially if we balance good and bad people


oh, i see
that's actually kind of funny
i need to get back into learning german
how many people here even speak it fluently
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
maybe someday i'll just take an extended trip to germany
then ifnar and i can meet up and ~~wildly makeout~~ get schnitzel or something
and dirt
also what the fuck i absolutely thought you lived in germany
guess i was mistaken
no fucking way, realy
depends on the kind of conversation we want to have
about dirt science? maybe
what i ate for lunch? no
i mean, i guess i'm happy that it's technically new content and not a remake
they shouldn't be doing anymore remakes
they're completely unnecessary at this point
/r/pokemon salt on fully display
i say as if i'm not somewhat salty myself
i don't know
i would like to say that all franchises are doomed to fade into obscurity at some point, i don't even necessarily think that's true with pokemon yet
the quality of each game has changed dramatically as time goes by, but sword and shield made a fucking bazillion dollars didn't it
that's kind of a shame in my opinion, because pokemon is in sore need of some videogame industry shame
gamefreak and the pokemon company's business strategies have become increasingly frustrating and borderline unethical
they need to get smacked but people keep eating their shit up
i don't care if their audience loves it, the games are increasingly bad
the details of sword and shield's development cycle were shameful and offensive, but it made like record sales because people don't care
stripping the national dex because they "wanted more time to work on animations and graphics" and then it turned out they were just ripping assets from previous games and their engineers were so fucking incompetent they couldn't get all the pokemon
that's why they made the really unorthodox choice of only including the charmander line at first, it was a cover for their own ineptitude
andrew, are you fucking daft
i'm saying their fans don't care about quality
obviously they care about pokemon you fucking dingus
all of that salt is concenrated in /r/pokemon
the vast majority of fans don't give a shit
no, and i refuse to admit how flawed that is because i'm obnoxious and stubborn
but really, are you saying a shit ton of people are complaining in general?
then how did the games make a fuckzillion dollars
okay, then my statement stands
the vast majority of people don't give a shit about the quality because it's pokemon
why is this so hard for you to understand
i guess i can't really dispute that, i complain vociferously about homestuck 2 being shitty but i read it whenever it updates anyway
i just feel like the money making model for pokemon is sufficiently different, it's a one time 60 dollar purchase for each game
no i didn't
it has not been over a year
and it's funny you should mention that
after i get done with elite dangerous i was going to try and get back into higurashi
my brain just gets too obsessed with shit
wait, what
which game is that
oh
i mean, i have it fuck--okay die

i need to find a capture card for my switch but i think i'd like to stream pokemon sword and shield
people were asking about that yesterday
i haven't played a pokemon game in 70 years
no you dinguses, or dingii
wait, which one is clover
that's the 4chan one isn't it
doesn't it have lots of offensive memes laced in it
i'm pretty sure i remember one that's literally a middle eastern terrorist

i was going to say, that's quite a sell you're offering
also no, i'm almost done with elite dangerous
as in, basically completely done for now
i just mined the last of the LTD i was planning on getting, cashed them out, and am currently loading up my fleet carrier with tritium
yes
what stream
no, we were both busy today
it might return tomorrow if we have some time
sad! but fair

yeah, i'm in the middle of a job search
kind of irritated about it, to be honest, i've been told i only have until the end of july to find one and get out
people aren't exactly hiring right now, what with the pandemic, so i'm worried that i'm kind of boned
still got five weeks though, so it's whatever

an all-ban would be better so they could witness their shaming

also like, if raids ever do happen again i guess it would make it so we can temporarily give janitors that power too
i highly doubt we'll ever see anything like the stuff from early 2017, the fuck raids, or the child porn stuff again though
homestuck isn't popular enough to merit that kind of attention

Since Pesterquest is finished and there's still no news whatsoever about Hiveswap: Act 2, we're going to merge those channels into <#530564260720410644>-games. This'll cover all other official Homestuck-related games like Friendsim, or anything they might put out in the future.
welcome to the new channel, same as the old channel(s)
check announcements

deleting all channels is preferable to bringing back <#529739286543728650>
why are you saying that in here
the only russian literature i'm aware of reading is a day in the life of ivan denisovitch
which was quality slice of gulag life
i mean, he was kind of both at different times
he started off as a champion of the people but then he literally turned himself into the emperor of france and started trying to establish an empire
1800s, i think his reign is considered the start of "modern" politics
political history i mean
yeah, he was the average height at the time
before he got fucked, he was enormously popular with the french people
```Napoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe. His Napoleonic Code has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world. British historian Andrew Roberts states: "The ideas that underpin our modern world‚Äîmeritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on‚Äîwere championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of the Roman Empire".```
as someone said before, he was just interested in spreading french culture
by "spreading french culture" i mean assimilating other countries into his empire
pretty boilerplate imperialism stuff
he didn't quite get there though, obviously
was it waterloo that he was deposed after
before julius caesar, the roman empire had actually been a republic
caesar was an extremely successful military leader though, and he grew so popular that he was crowned emperor
then he got knifed
staunch oversimplifications are what we deal in, misha
qualifying cultural impact with "current" is ridiculous
europe is literally the way it is now because of napoleon
yeah it's pretty good
it's a one-off joke, obviously, not worth replaying unless you find it really funny
cicero: `Let's kill someone!`
bert maklin
i don't actually know about any of that for the US
as it is though, regardless of whatever the laws were on paper, i'm sure instances of abuse of slaves were overlooked by just about everyone in the community
that was called indentured servitude in the US
gitaxian, shut up
you're being a jackass
i guess it's fine to bring that up, but the way you were talking about it felt like you were suggesting we were too
word your posts better IDIOT
that's not totally verified i think
i guess conceptually it was similar enough
see: mining towns before wage reforms in the early 1900s
instead of getting paid you got coupons for food and rent
i don't understand, why did they have these stipulations
did it change the overall status of the slave or
jesus christ
yeah fair enough
it's just kind of viscerally horrifying to think of how common this practice has been throughout history
thank goodness it's been (mostly) abolished
that's why i added that mostly, obviously there are places where slavery is still used, which is infuriating
bah, fine
let's go back to talking about roman slavery then
who was the most important roman slave
no, i was asking about any specific historical figures
that's not exactly surprising though
gotta indulge in that sweet sweet pederasty am i right
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> makin please
i've always been ashamed of my lack of knowledge in this area but you're making me look like a fucking scholar
yeah woc, i had no idea how common old coins are
i bought a couple of roman pennies the other day and i was just awestruck that something 1700 years old was still around and decently preserved
and fucking cheap no less
that's... interesting
what does that even mean
<:waitwhat:316648744579760128>
i almost kind of feel sorry for this guy, i'm impressed at how redpilled he is
or is this beyond redpilling
EM spectrum woc, EM spectrum
holy shit, he actually believes this?
i didn't know i could be anymore astounded
no yeah, that's not really in contention here
being physically healthy is good, and can improve your mental condition
saying that it eliminates _all_ mental problems and literally turns you into a chad though? that's like a hop skip and a jump away from legit insanity
i guess he took the phrase "the brain is the most important muscle in the body" seriously
no, we're still dunking on reactionaries, don't worry
i think it's kind of okay to laugh at these takes though
you can only be so outlandish and still get taken seriously
is it still on the shills list
you should probably just remove it honestly
eh, fair enough
i feel kind of grimy giving these people any sort of attention is all
i'm willing to defend god shaped hole but not very much
if people came at me with arguments for why it should be removed i would probably end up agreeing, it just has too much going against it
"well-written stylistically" only carries it so far
in a vacuum, you're right
i mean, that's verifiably different
i don't think hussie hates women, he was just writing a character who does
pretty sure that 0hp is himself sexist, in whatever form that manifests in
which makes his writing that much worse
i've also previously argued for total death of the author though, so i don't really know where to stand on that
i'm not seriously advocating that makin remove it from the list, he can do whatever he wants with it
they're coarse and rough and irritating
and they get everywhere
i have no shills list, i'm not that egotistical
i'm actually making a bit of progress with that git
i try to write a bit each day and i'm constantly looking back and forth to reedit what i've got
i showed misha the first chapter i wrote and he was like "yeah this is actually decent"
i'm still trying to figure out how to be more descriptive without doing it too much, and also maintain the style the original author had
fuck, realy
i thought i renewed that
we definitely need to watch the good seasons of fairly oddparents at some point
it's got pretty snappy humor all things considered
it's just one of those quality shows
i refuse
okay i think i've figured out how to get my SSL certification
it's weird because they had a free trial when i initially made the website that just did it automatically?
now we have to figure out how to do it, although it doesn't seem that hard
cpanel
because i had drewlinky at some point in the past but it was attached to a different email that literally doesn't exist anymore
website recertified
elf on a shelf
wait did we talk about ohp again
oh, harry potter
thank goodnes
oh nevermind this still sucks
i have to second that, what?
most elves really, really enjoy being servants
dobby is an odd case, and it's pretty well justified given that his master was lucius malfoy and a complete bastard to him
the books are pretty internally consistent, they just lack details that are filled in elsewhere
rowling's takes are terrible because they're often loose political statements that make no sense, or they're completely insane or unnecessary stuff
like the infamous remark about wizards regularly shitting their pants and using a spell to clean it up
before the invention of toilets anyway
well, the damage is done
that information is canonical by word of god
i actually really like book 6 because it's like a peek into how layered the magical world _could_ be without getting dumb or overwhelming about it
but it also introduces shit like felix felicis
which, while i love that it's literally magic LSD, it also makes you wonder why people don't use that more often
oh <:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
i don't remember, i last read it when i was like 17
that just sounds like people not paying enough attention
it's been like 8 years and i could still recall a hefty portion of the plot
maybe because it's written like a mystery novel when it really shouldn't be
>comes out of nowhere
oh
no buildup sure
it's foreshadowed plenty though
that's always been the biggest problem with it that i had, is that the focus on "half-blood prince" makes no sense
like, i guess it's associated with snape openly betraying them
but to me it was always the weakest part by far
like, why is it not called something related to the pensieve
i think chamber of secret's movie adaptation is definitely up there in terms of being faithful, but i really fucking hate the way the first two harry potter movies look and feel
it doesn't instill a sense of magic, it comes across as corny bullshit
it doesn't help that i really, really fucking hate richard harris's performance compared to michael gambon
richard harris doesn't evoke "whimsical, mysterious" to me
he just comes across as an old, tired fart
he literally didn't want the part either, he agreed to be dumbledore because his granddaughter would have been mad at him otherwise
michael gambon's debut in prisoner of azkaban was fucking great
he had just the right flavor to him
goblet of fire was... okay
i think people try too hard to dab on the "DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE" scene
yeah, see
you did it like immediately
it's tired and doesn't really reflect on the rest of the movie
sure
i also think it's weird, although i mostly enjoyed the book just fine
i remember seeing the trailer for it and being like "HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT"
"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"
but then it came out and it was like stupid edgy in all the places with krum, and cut out all of the interesting shit
it's completely disconnected with the rest of the plot
i want more scenes of michael gambon borderline strangling daniel radcliffe while angrily growling
they pray to the god of candy and rimming
i haven't seen swiss army man but i've looked at snippets and read some reviews
by all accounts it's an extremely eccentric, bizarre movie that manages to somehow be emotionally engaging
most people cope with death by drinking wine
Harry Potter and the Amazing Atheist
aw man
i've actually mostly finished all of the games i've been playing lately
i finally have ample time to write again
no
cry more br boy
eloze continuation
i've finished up five chapters and am working on the sixth
i feel pretty good about it honestly
i usually hate all of my own writing but this actually feels like it's turning into something vaguely decent
what is prey
yeah no shit sherlock
what's it about
which one are you telling me to play
yes, but only once he embraces his wild side
read eloze and you'll find out
~~i'm ashamed that it took me a minute to realize you were making that joke~~
doesn't ring a bell i'm afraid
i've never found any other zelda fic worthy of my time besides eloze
why not all of the above
i've never experienced system shock, what is
oh shiiiit, an old zelda fansite
this reminds me of one i used to look at all the time, one second
it's dead now, but wayback machine has it thankfully http://web.archive.org/web/20030210082845/http://www.tbi.net/%7Emax/zelda64.htm
because it's too powerful
the internet is a fantastic technology
no, i played it for the first time in college
yeah, immensely
i think that i like it more than mother 3, althoguh i could be pressed to agree that mother 3 is technically better
what the fuck is cogdis
you know, when i think about it, i haven't actually played many fan games
what are you talking about
we still don't have a halflife fan game where gordon is a giant space cock who shoots sperm bullets at i don't know how to finish this joke
you must own a 4chan gold account to unlock dark mode
ooh boy i'm excited
i got a couple thousand words done
it's so nice to be writing again
woc getting his weekly cancellation
aw yeah it's time for an absurd rhetorical debate
FLAT
FUCK
FRIDAY
es ist freitag, meine kerle
no idea, makin's in charge of that
i think cowboy bebop was pretty high up in the running though
god, really? why death note
it's not bad or anything, i just don't understand why people want to watch it that much right now
<@!257144766901256192> you don't deserve to be offended
does antimatter dimensions get more interesting
what do you mean "technically"
ehh
alright i guess
i need something to scratch the itch though, fuck
i have no idea what infinity points are but alright
i'll just see what happens
antimatter dimensions
i'm looking for yet another idle game
nothing feels right though

excuse me what the fuck
i'm dead inside
i shold probably give titantfall 2 a try
i loved the campaign, i'm sure multiplayer is a blast
or the element of surprise
i need to play pathfinder, that sounds fucking hilarious
wow, did not expect such detractions
if it's relatively straightforward i don't know why he wouldn't just tell them
if they've got like fun shit hidden on the side then maybe not
no carl, you fucking moron
more along the lines of "its function is this" and then don't tell them about anything extra
cuz they'll find out after they use it
maybe he thought the ability was passive
this is where explaining shit can be useful
it's a game gnawms literally shills for
it looks pretty cool
also i want to get earth defense force 5 but i really, really shouldn't honestly
we haven't even beaten EDF4
no, i'm just saying it's 30 bucks on sale right now and i shouldn't be spending that moolah
especially when i've got other stuff to do like higurashi
now that i've brought it up, i guess it's time to get back to it
higurashi, your ass is grass
such is as it goes
"Shopkeep, what game should we play?"
"Here's one called Billionaire. Also if you lose you have to buy the game." FUCK YOU TOO
i'll allow it
why is this image an mp4
<@!207991389613457408> i forgot it frequently has stuff like this in it
apparently
vibe check is great, also evil jello
extreme ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è merry-go-round is just true
apparently dr disdidsidsidsidsi was stealth promoting some bullshit product called shungite
```To those that are confused.

From what I can gather Doc had an undisclosed endorsement deal with a company that sells Shungite.

The clip everyone is referencing is the one where he is essentially stealth promoting the product.

That's a no no.

man, there was some game on steam i wanted when it got to summer sale but now i can't remember what it is
sign
yers
i never use wishlists to be honest
silence, monkey
anyway hwo do i sell my steam inventory
cards and shit

we need to give pets longer lives
holy SHIT
<@!207991389613457408> i have the music for higurashi turned off so i can listen to my own stuff while i read, which is great, but i kept the sound effects on. so just now the game had the rusty sliding door sound effect and i shit my pants thinking someone was breaking into the house
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
fine
also i'm going to blast screenshots in here because that's what makin does and he can suck my popsicle

COCAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE
also tell me this girl doesn't give off some serious virtunat energy

oh yeah this girl is 100% nat
SPAT_irl
serious spoom energy right now
what the actual fuck?
this is absolutely nat
<@!257144766901256192> are you stealing your personality from this game
you fucking devil woman
i am historically not a fan of visual novels so it's kind of difficult to get into, but i promised misha i would
it's not bad, i just have a bad attention span
~~he also agreed that he would reread eloze if i did this, and i value his insight on my continuation~~
i am a desperate man
bro...
uh
when was this
i highly doubt we have ever conducted a survey like that
qweq, why are you suggesting such horrible management ideas today
no, i don't want you to do that
done--
see you in five years buddy
they called me
also, they're playing some variant of old maid called "old bachelor"
suddenly i really miss playing card games with people
maybe we could get some online poker going one of these days
i'm no good at poker but it's fun to jibberjab and play a few hands with friends
you mean without?
oh god no, we would never play with fucking money
it would have to be something silly, like what dingus suggested
i feel like a cafe lit game night with a winner role is a great idea
ooh, that's great
until the next game night
what in the actual fuck gnawms?
i am fucking flabbergasted
i can't believe this is real, i just can't
Traducir Tweet
it's a metaphor for real life
you don't talk to my WIFE like that
buddy would you please sit down
unacceptable
try again
oh yeah no, that was about tropic thunder
that's completely accurate
anyway, we should definitely start up a game night
once a week i imagine
what should we play, hearts or some shit
nah, fuck that
no jackbox games, they're fun for a bit but they quickly get tired out
monopoly also is banned unless we decide to go with house rules only
otherwise it takes fucking forever
yes
what are you, racist
what no, i thought it was the other way around
instituting stuff like putting taxes in the center and whoever lands on free parking wins it
why are these people taking so fucking long to play old maid <:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
let's play something right now, something quick and easy
i'm fiending for quality time with my bros and ladies and other
ESCALATOR ESCALATOR ESCALATOR
eeeeeeeeeeeeellsssssssssssssss
wait, is escalators a card game
i thought you were referencing spongebob
how does it work
do i need to make an executive decision and choose what we're playing tonight
how many people do we have who are interested
i'm in
i wish we had screencapped my rendition of michael jackson, but it doesn't matter because the next person literally got michael jackson too
i'm fucking dying over here
soul silver
who won, tera or gnawms
alright tera, let me get you your role
eh, i'm not willing to put the role above janitors
or rather, i'm not willing to distinguish it above everyone in the server
tera is crowned the Game Night Champion though
that sounds good actually
hell no
i absolutely do not want to do board game online
i played it once and i was so fucking bored
it fucking sucks, we're not doing it
i don't want to play jackbox shit, i want to do like proper board games and/or card games
like i want to play god damn poker
what's TTS
i don't really know what that is
i see
that sounds pretty useful for us
ten dollars? alright
and there's a 4 pack
who needs it
anyone else
alright so tera, andrew, canis, and i'll put one more on there so i can get the discount
yes, it's a 4 pack so me is the 4th, and then i need one more to put it over 30 bucks and get a 5 dollar discount
who else
anyone may participate in game night
someone figure out who the last one is and i'll get it for them
<@!146014279529791488> this is your one chance to claim a copy of tabletop simulator
respond before someone else does
i'm getting tabletop simulator for a few people
negadrew said they'll participate so that's who gets it
send me your steam friendcodes if i'm not already friends with you
ah, fuck, nevermind
i can't buy multiple copies for some reason
qweq what's your steam id send me a friend request reeeee
or wait nevermind it was canis
<@!280782538711236608> are we friends on steam
alright, all copies of the game have been sent out
crime doesn't pay kids
and neither does being a minimum wage worker
the lesson: i don't fuckin know, figure something out
just a moment actually
can we try tabletop sim here in a second to see how it works
didn't even go exploring for this one, i was lucky enough that i jumped directly into system with my carrier <:trizzaSmug:684184347678736443>
holy shit, tabletop simulator looks fun
can we play a game of poker real fast
who up
i'm starting a room
still waiting for people to get in here
i have to physically invite people each time??
gimme an invite
ahhh, right, my bad
try now
i did friends only
but how are we supposed to feel exclusive that way
seems terrible
the only way it's worth it is if we're obnoxiously cliquey about it
didn't pull up anything on steam
just use this friend code
57122225
i can't wait for tabletop sim HSD game night
what the fuck are you zoomers talking about
is anyone here really familiar with the tabletop simulator interface
we're probably going to need a game master to officiate/deal for all of the shit we do
it's a cafe-lit game night, so anything we want to play realy
i guess we don't really need to be all that formal about it, as long as we're able to declare a winner
no moonjail, we already concluded our first game night hours ago
this is for future game nights
i bought myself, tera, andrew, and canis tabletop sim
we're going to try and make it a weekly thing
we including everyone who wants to participate
it works well enough for our purposes
it's already done you can't stop us
you have no chance make your time
+ 3 SKINS
yes, but only if we're playing brazilian games
qweq will have to host
the fuck is the bread game
alright we're not playing bread game
you know, i wish that it was possible to play egyptian rat screw with tts
but it wouldn't be anywhere near as satisfying
oh hell yes
ERS is my fucking jam
we're definitely doing that for game night sometime
even if i didn't always win, my hands are big so it intimidated the other players
got my fucking sandwiches
i haven't played chinese checkers in fucking years, i don't remember how it works
i wonder when we should have game night
friday evenings are always a good candidate
maybe i can set up a poll
hm
it's less fun if it excludes people
maybe TTS can be every other week, or as a separate thing
then again, it's hard if you include too many people
why must this place be so successful? truly a curse
man, i have to take a step back for a second
this place has fucking _17,000_ people
that's a fucking shitload
that's 8.5 times the population of my hometown
because they deserve it
oh you said "how"
nevermind i'm an idiot
help bees out would you
<@!207991389613457408> man, come on
it's not dissuading me or anything but i hate when stories do the "GO NEGATIVE COLOR, HAVE SHOCKING SOUND EFFECTS PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND" trope
it makes my hair stand up on end
opposite colors, like black to white
ez lyfe
also the little bits and pieces of mismatched details between scenes is creeping me out
it's a game that simulates playing tabletop games
like card games or chess or checkers
i dicked around with it a bit ago and it's hilarious
you should pick it up so we can play sometime
yeah, yeah
table top sim is usually 20 bucks but it's on sale for 10 right now
we can play divinity original sin sometime this weekend if you want
just stop being a whiny wiener about it
then he can DIE
in my arms tonight

well you guys have fun with that
i really should run a poll to see when game night is
i think we'll have a designated week for TTS each month, or maybe every other week
it depends
nah
we should give it a try sometime then
it's not like we're limited by time
deep, dark fantasies
oh shit
dude, this is gonna be great
that's what people wanted
so you'll get DMed by weirdoes
dero is my sister, don't worry about it
nepotism abounds
dero will inherit the server next
did dero DM you asking you to shill for SCP
she's been wanting to play for weeks
üò¶
what's gimli's grandfather's name
OH
you know what? i remember the transition to that
it was because gimli's grandfather's actual, real name is "groin"
https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gr%C3%B3in
i don't know precisely how that turned into "poop ballsack" but it was easily the hardest i've laughed in over a year
like full on spittle coming out of my mouth, unable to breathe because as soon as i got any air in my lungs it was immediately expelled again
tera asking "is that actually his real name" has changed me forever
read lord of the rings, it's great
aaaaaa she said the thing
nat
some horse shit like that
whoa there friendo, did you just use the R WORD?
GET THE HOSE
yeah i'm just messing
unmitigated nonsense
sheer foolishness
i should write a little bit more tonight
especially now that i'm actually bothering to get through higurashi
that shit's going to take forever though
what is it, like 20 chapters per installment
wales pls
i was just joking, shut up wench
you are a gremlin, that is the end of the matter
see what i fucking mean? unbelievable
i'm glad you didn't go fucking crazy with it
you ever win any matches like that
who was
no idea what that is
wath
when was mansa musa alive

carlarc has permanently forfeited his react privileges because he was a serial abuser back in the day
oh
i must have missed that conversation
well, if that's what makes her comfortable then that's how it is

nooo
do you feel better for having seen fesh pince
there are so many in-jokes and regurgitated memes in here based on it though
how could you get sick of us saying "would you make me a sandwich" four billion times

see, i know i've expressed my disinterest in fringe but i'm genuinely not _trying_ to miss these streams
it's harder to find time for myself now that i'm at home
i don't have any plans for tomorrow though, i'll read synopses and join in this time
you'd think, but i'm suddenly around all my family again
plus job hunting
is it possible to learn this power
oh fuck i remembered what i was interested in for the steam summer sale
lost planet
holy shit they are DIRT CHEAP
definitely picking these up

is it considerably better than EDF4
i would be immensely appreciative, i shouldn't be spending anymore money on games even though i just said i was grabbing the lost planet games
nights and i are definitely looking forward to EDF again though
shit's great

>housemates
<:jackBluh:585537437489561601>
yes
i had roommates, never again
one of them was constantly drunk and made a mess around the house, never bothered to clean up after himself
one time he went out at midnight to go fishing, came back an hour with an adult goose and filled the tub up with water so he could keep it as a pet
the noise woke up one of my other roommates and she started fucking screaming at him to take it back to the pond
mind you, this pond was a few miles away and he had no car, so he had to physically carry this fucking goose from and back to the lae
that guy was fucking plastered constantly, i have no idea how he was admitted to college
if avians could talk
you're pretty young compared to the average user in this channel
and maybe in general too
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
i'm closer to 30 than i am to 20 and that realization is kind of weird to me
dude
not fucking cool
hard R and everything, jesus
alright, that's enough
my birthday is next month, if you're going strictly by year like an anal retentive wiener then yes i'm exactly in the middle
but i'm going by months/days, in which case i'm still closer
no matter how you slice it, it still feels <:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
this generation isn't going to live to 60

it's almost like there's a balance to be struck between two extreme forms of thought
there is literally no difference between good and bad things
check the inbox stupid
ree ree, etc
irregardless is an incorrect form of the word "regardless"
yes, they mean the exact same thing, people just appended "ir" to it to make it sound more refutative for some reason
hormonome
thank you tensei very cool
woc i have to admit, i dislike the usage of the fake word "irregardless" as much as you do, but you're lookin' like a fool out here
4000 years? corporeal form will be abolished
subcultures within subcultures within subcultures
i think spitting on people is considered a form of assault
i think it's fine to argue that this is the logical conclusion of an official system which has broken down and no longer functions properly
i don't think it's fine to argue that this is a good thing
ifnar, you've argued this before, that doesn't work
at least not in america
police unions and culture have basically become baked in, it would take a complete reset in order to accomplish what you're suggesting, and that's just not feasible
"don't get harassed out" <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
alright, whatever you say big guy
no rest for the class conscious
wait, did makin really freeze the channel
with a secret code
that's pretty insidious
waht
suffer for your crimes
don't we usually start stream by now
am i missing something
<@!120187484863856640> F1X TH1S
WHAT
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
no, that tweet is real
i was reeing the different stream time
different than assumed*
is it time for beegposting?

suffer for your crimes against humanity
no don't, we need more unique beegers
that's a quality beeg
how old is beeg now
jesus, that's old for a dog
she must be protected at all costs
oh no <:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
that's the worst thing you could possibly have told me, ever
that's fucking horrible
unspeakable damage
no i said it here on purpose
stoopit
yeah this isn't really a case of bad sexual dimorphism
one of them is just a fucking snake
mfw i'm stuck in traffic on my way to meet my dad and my jacked lil bro passes me on a fucking skateboard
jesus
i always forget altgenstuck exists and then conversations like this pop up
i need to write about it
i'm already writing a decent entry but this deserves to go in
you'll just have to see
i don't know about early canmt, but i got the scoop from someone about that
possibly wheals
wow
misha, where do you find this literal shit
it caught me so off guard, i don't know what to say
i have tears coming out of my eyes
holy fucking crap, that got me good
oh jesus christ
i stopped laughing at it for a bit but then i heard the noise again in my head and i'm fucking losing it again
it's so obtrusive and sudden
those poor kids
i do, but that was such an effective bait and switch that i literally cannot be mad
i'm still eking liquid out of my tearducts as we speak
no, it's not scatological humor, it's anything that's sufficiently jarring/catches me off guard
it's why dero makes me laugh so much, she's a fucking master at that stuff
at least in a way that i find funny
yeah, exactly
okay, enough of the video
i don't want to see that anymore
the nesquik pool video was infinitely better as derivative material
brapposting is still punishable by death
i'm confused and not sure what to make of this
you made more sense when you were posted on undertale's birthday
speaking of which, deltarune when
i'm not writing about the nesquik pool in spat, it's just not happening
in the toilet
durians
oh sweet krelez released another mix two days ago
chiptune time
spat entry complete by the way
i don't think it's time for release yet though, i want a couple more in there
it's likely that we'll never know, because WP for some inscrutable reason feels that refusing to give any details about why or how things happen behind the scenes is a good way to inspire confidence in the stability of their properties
that or they just don't give a shit, pick your poison
i wouldn't mind it so much if they weren't incredibly hostile about attempts to ask or figure it out
i asked a couple of times why certain things were happening, and i got shouted at because i "didn't need to know that information"
no, there's been a long history of extreme animosity
that's the commonly accepted explanation, but as time goes by i increasingly doubt that there was ever any such goodwill
or at the very least, there was no goodwill like that between the people who currently exist in this fandom and on the official team
back when i still talked to a few people from the official team, there were a few times where we all took a step back and described this weird quasi-inheritance of bad blood from our forebears, so to speak
it often felt that, when i was talking about problems in the community, it was talking about stuff that i was never personally involved in
i started participating in the fandom proper in late 2016, and it feels like the origin of a lot of things that people are STILL mad about was from like early 2016 or far earlier
at this point i'm starting to unironically agree with the idea that homestuck needs to be put to rest
the creator is not involving himself out of cursory additions and token efforts, which is by itself a bad sign
not to mention a litany of other administrative problems that basically hamstrings the project itself and has made the fandom unrecoverably irritated wi
i find myself wondering if yiffany would have been better received in homestuck's heyday
yeah, sure
i guess the thing is that the fakeouts were short-lived things though
now you get an update twice a month, or used to at least
a fakeout can't be accomplished because it would happen at the beginning or middle of the update and it wouldn't last long enough to have an impact, OR it would happen at the end and people would be pissed off waiting for the rest of it to develop two weeks later
or hell, even later because the story keeps jumping around from perspective to perspective
that sort of stuff doesn't work with this timeframe and pace

i'm late, i got distracted talking to my grandfather
someone said something about homestuck 2 making the authors seem worse than they really are
i agree with this, but ONLY from a literary perspective
i don't actually know that much about the writing capabilities of the team members
however
their ability to engage with fans, or to know when NOT to engage with them, is indisputably pathetic and miserable
i could forgive a lot of bullshit with the comic itself being bad, but the things we've seen over the last six months by themselves from official team members, or at least one in particular, has been kind of shocking
yeah, precisely krato
it's one thing to just ignore your fanbase, that's arguably one of the safest things you could do with your property even if it makes some of them mad
but explicitly and even purposefully turning it into an adversarial relationship? what the fuck is the logic in that?
look, i have no problem with challenging media
this isn't what that means
i know the kind of argument you're referencing though, it's part of the reason i used to get so fucking pissed off about engaging in this sort of dialogue
the rhetoric that was regularly employed against us was unbelievably disingenuous
because we were interested in putting down the extreme hostility that had developed, nostalgic
things were extremely intense then, and we just wanted the shitflinging to stop
in retrospect, things could probably have been handled differently
<@!343831026373623808> what we got out of it was getting kate to stop her false accusations, that's about it
makin is demonstrably a much better person than he was when i joined the server
i openly disagreed with the way he handled himself many, many times back then, but in the last two years i've had little to no complaint
boom, i didn't say that i liked the end result
i was just describing what we got out of it
i have a lot of problems with the way the negotiations proceeded for precisely the reason you're describing
but what's done is done
maybe two years is too long, definitely in the year preceding his stepping down though
look, makin's not perfect, but he built the subreddit up over 10 years into probably the largest single repository of homestuck discussion left
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
fair play
makin's not perfect but he posts <a:megababyvore:525031793062051841> on a regular basis
no. wait for the proper time
i also hate it krato
people who pay attention will note i've been doing that too though, and it makes me so exhausted that i participate in hiding things too
nah, it would be pretty inflammatory to just put everything out there
maybe when homestuck is firmly dead
homestuck isn't quite a corpse yet, it's just on life support
still not great, but it's got a heartbeat somewhere in there
probably krato, just not right now
i'm kind of incensed about it because one of the stipulations i explicitly obtained was to be able to explain every facet of our discussions with hussie and the team, but as a mod team we still decided to employ some discretion over what we talked about
kind of ironic when i think about it, but whatever
is this something i already know about
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
holy shit, lit is on fire tonight
i think i accidentally deleted that ping, i checked it out but i can't remember what it was
remind me
ah yes
i remember now
i'm allowing it
truth is we're considering making makin a moderator again
strictly speaking he never stopped participating in the creative process, obviously he does streams and shit and has valuable insight on how things work
~~plus i could pawn off the work of making community streams on him again~~
it's not about "bowing to demands," it's about not being in flagrant violation of good will
i think the mod team's loose consensus is that remodding makin this soon after altercations would be seen as a provocation, even though makin is completely fine now
we're not really willing to go through that because even if unjust, it would be fucking annoying to deal with
relatively fine, whatever
how do you mean
for all intents and purposes he is still part of the staff, he just has no real authority in terms of banning people or executing policy
i still value his input on basically everything, he ran this place for four fucking years
i have no interest in giving him the server back and probably won't unless WP turns completely vicious and starts like
making threats on my life or pushing lawsuits
i doubt it'll come to that though, so we should be fine
yeah qweq
i trust him completely as someone who gets the community involves and makes fun stuff for people to do
i'm less sure of him as a diplomatic figure, which is what an admin should be
he's a lot better now than he was but still
i would be more than fine with him as a full mod
i completely doubt the ability of anyone who has ever worked for WP to make or execute a threat on someone else's health
i wouldn't put up with it if it came to that is all i'm saying
mines what part of `i completely doubt the ability of anyone who has ever worked for WP to make or execute a threat on someone else's health` do you not understand
yes i definitely said that
i'm being persecuted for things i never said, again
Sad!
oh, i'm comfortable sharing this little tidbit
back when the server had just been handed off, we were figuring out a line of succession if things went really wrong, and next in line was, i shit you not, woc
i mean, realistically, if they kept fucking with us the actual thing we would have done is reinstall makin
woc as server owner would just be tremendously funny
would have been too obvious and not fun enough
the whole complicated bullshit we did for april fool's was better
i wish he did
that was mike blossom

nice dude
i'm excited
although i think we're going to limit how often we do TTS, we should try and include more people if possible
yes, ERS is fucking great
yeah, it totally is b3es
r-right
what would homestuck 0 be exactly
anything about my streams yet
true that
https://twitter.com/drdisrespect/status/1277060051744591872
what the fuck is wrong with you people, how have you kept this going for half an hour
alright, alright, that's enough
no more conspiracy theories
you people are nuts
<:reeeee:248154233352749056>
seriously, stop
last warning
that's fine carl
no more fucking conspiracies though

i'll repin improvements
i have to admit, the bottom image makes me feel a bit weird too
<:monkaHmm:547970963543949313>
how about a round of ERS in tabletop sim, anyone?
<@!338881173268987904> you got that shit ready?
ERS is an acronym for Egyptian Rat Screw
you know how slapjack works? it's like that but not for fucking babies
face cards have values that need to be matched, doubles, and sandwiches (doubles with one between) are all slappable, penalties for incorrect slaps
it's undoubtedly more fun in real life but this might be a fine substitute
what did he mean by this
that definitely wasn't as fun as i was hoping, but it was alright
we'll have to stick to more traditional games
yes, do that gnawms

much better carl
what in the fuck is going on with the milky way
adapt
fuck, that's actually a great idea
woc, make a kornheiser function
fill the bot with a billion kornheiser memes
picks one at random
look, kornheiser is a treasure beyond imagining
you will not stop his glorious reign

not right now
alright, that's enough
that's a quality image
i don't know gnawms, maybe you should have thought before you committed this grievous error
put star wars in there
RLM memes
return to the past, now
no he wouldn't carl
makin is asleep at this time
me though? it's not fast enough to warrant a za warudo
i'll just temp ban anyone who continues shitposting
oh, right... <:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
that sucks
yeah we did tera
ERS was okay but not great
we'll have to keep it to more suitable card games
it did start getting a bit faster there near the end as we got used to the interface
but there's nothing quite like people leaning in and the game getting ultra fast with greater competency
my favorite games of ERS are when you're in constant danger of getting the shit slapped out of you by trigger happy paranoid freaks
what's the over/under on this being true
4 in so far
what do you think of shatner's overacting
fucking kornheiser
me being able to guess "yiffy" instantaneously--and being the only one who could--was also great
mog!

none of this stuff makes any sense or has any larger purpose but it's just like an incredible number of vignettes that are all great
one time i was laying in bed and kind of shifted around so i could get in a more comfortable position, and i hurt my back
that's what getting older is like
you're incorrect makin
go on any right-wing/conservative space and it's perfectly common parlance
this place is graced by being a comparatively non-political space
makin, i live in a right wing conservative space
but yes i also look at right-wing subreddits and articles sometimes in order to get a sense of what they believe and why
it's usually very depressing
ah, but we don't talk about kate for her political opinions, we talk about her because of the way she publicly behaves and treats other people
pretty significant difference if you ask me
basically
i don't trust them to do shit until they've actually done it

what in the fuck am i reading
<@!207991389613457408> i think i've hit a decent stride with higurashi finally
i'm still not terribly interested in whatever plot is here, but i'm doing one chapter a day
doesn't take too long and i remember most of the details just fine
i mean, if i get into it then obviously i'll go faster
it's just hard overcoming the visual novel format, i really, really chafe against it
i'm starting to like the characters, so that's a good sign
<@!173936231229554688> i don't have a favorite VN, besides ever17 i've never finished one
i don't even think VNs are categorically bad, i just find the format annoying

man, i fucking _wish_ i got paid to manage online communities
all things considered i don't think i'm bad at it
did somebody say ishtar
i have put a price of 20,000 dirham on their heads
i didn't exactly get to see any of it
the way it's presented in the first couple hours was basically garbled nothing
i guess like
okay
i'm definitely being too hard on the game
i wasn't particularly in the mood to play it so that didn't help
i don't enjoy being pushed to do stuff
i have to give myself time to sort of ease into it
i didn't encounter anything that really made me interested in what was going on, it felt like all of the aliens were just generic monsters that i was breezing through without much issue
i also kind of like being able to play totally by myself, whereas i get the impression destiny 2 is a collaborative game
~~i might give destiny 2 another try in the future, i managed to restore another harddrive so i have space for games again~~
but if there's anything that gives a good intro to the lore that could spark interest, i'd like to see it

why the fuck do you say shit like this
wait
are you calling it a manifesto because you're referencing whatever
or do you not know about spat and you chose that word as a coincidence
spat is a document i've written over the last three years
i detail events and people from this server and occasionally other places like the subreddit
or the fandom in general
i don't think i saw that one mint
anyway bees, if you're curious, you can find it here https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/SPATfrontcover.html
don't worry about it too much though, it's really long and only interesting if you enjoy reading about esoteric and weird subcultures
griever was around since nearly the beginning, he made/makes jojostuck
then he left some time over a year ago, came back months later just to call this server a festering shithole
then he got hired on at WP
we used to really like him
i guess he disagreed with makin's ways of doing things more than we thought
it's either that or he actually believes the things he said
both possibilities suck
holy shit yes
this is easily the best run i've had in a long time

i forget nostalgic, do you have a paypal email

yeah, i still am salty about that scarf
never had a package go missing in the mail before

there it is lads
it's been 3000 years...
i think i can finally say i'm fucking done with noita
and it only took an absurd amount of prep and chees
you mean which work i got?
or sampo, whichever
uh
i'm not sure what you're referring to
is this a new update thing
ohhh
i've never done any of that
i'll try it now that i've beat the game properly, sure
i feel dumb now, i don't know what that is either
seems i've been missing out
i mean i already beat the final boss, i got the red lion with 5 orbs
i know there's a secret ending with 12 orbs but you have to get the last one from a parallel world and it starts to drain health
that having been said, i can't actually find a description of the secret ending anywhere
which is weird to me
i don't understand
i know, i mean i don't understand the original joke
what is wrong with sampo
this is unmitigated foolishness
ah, i see
danny and arin?
i don't know, i like hearing this
i'm fiercely anti-danny era game grumps

it's fine beees, this is just regular banter
we try not to take things seriously here
oh you're playing along
nevermind fuq u
egoraptor used to be more principled but then game grumps became successful and then none of that mattered
which, to be fair, i probably would do that too if i find even a modicum of success
but still
hell no
it would be nice but that would open me up to way too much scruinty
it's all so tiresome
hell i'm not even sure opening up a patreon to explicitly compensate me for managing this place is even _legal_
pizza roll, pleb
but yes i do actually
<@!168980988477702145> i don't really have one

the point isn't "i dislike these people," it's "i don't like forgetting past altercations because it can serve as important precedent and be used as evidence of the fact that we actually do shit around here"
bah, you're just a rebellious child
what the fuck this is not the same thing at all
i'm not bringing this up as a way to publicly ridicule morons, althoguh i definitely think that would be fun and worthwhile too
i'm literally asking about this as a matter of internal reference, because i've forgotten a large majority of these incidents and would like to be able to remind myself of them
<:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
stoopit stoopit stoopit uncle fill
no we're still working our way through it
there's an insane degradation in quality once you get to season 3 though
all of the plots become kind of moronic
in one of them xana was, i shit you not, a food monster
oh good
yeah, that's the thing i keep noticing about it
dream on bud
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> jesus
there are two things that we started noticing around the end of season 2 and especially season 3
the first is an overabundance of unnecessary flipping and jumping
no, on code lyoko
every other episode, yumi in particular will do backflips for 30 fucking seconds in a row, and then at some point she developed this absurd technique where she becomes a fucking helicopter, using her fans as blades
i'm not kidding, she can't fly with it but she uses it to slow down her fall speed
every time i see it i can't help but laugh out loud
the other thing we noticed is aelita flipping rapidly between hyper competent and moron deluxe
you can easily tell which episodes were written by people simping hard on aelita
No more texts for today.
OK Boomer is the new n-word, says some assholeo n twitter
adn then months later it fell into disuse

<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
wait, does kris even have a gender
isn't it specifically ambiguous
they is also historically an ambiguous pronoun, just because more modern conventions accept the possibility of it being a distinct thing doesn't mean that the old meaning doesn't still apply
don't be obtuse
<:annoyedPepe:347205246457610260>
whatever
that doesn't really follow, because chara isn't a protagonist figure
and there are countless examples of games where the protagonist is an unidentified gender so they're referred to as "they"
alright, so it's not actually countless and i misspoke as to what i'm trying to describe
what i'm trying to say is that there are lots of instances where a protagonist is never strictly identified as one or the other, see any game where you create a protag so there's no canonical interpretation of the character
in that case the character could be anything so the protag is generally referred to as "they"
this has varying degrees of complexity
kris fits in that slot because we don't know what gender they are, gender-conformative or no
using that as explicit evidence to say they're nonbinary is kind of weird in my opinion
like, i can see why you might arrive at that conclusion but given this exact set of circumstances i would never have come to that result myself
nah it just came out in october
so it's like the anniversary
makin shut up
okay, see
mines, this is why i find it weird
you took a character with an ambiguous, _unspecified_ gender and immediately turned it into nonbinary
that's not what you're supposed to take away from it
that's correct, frisk's gender is not specified anywhere in the game so we literally do not know what the fuck their gender is
that's what i'm saying
no, that's not how the word "they" works
it has never worked that way until the last few years when it became more of a social thing
"they" has historically been a word that is used as a placeholder for when you don't know what someone or something's gender is
when i don't know whether an animal is male or female i refer to it as "they" until i know better
this just feels like personal bias rearing its ugly head
because nonbinary is a specific type of identity even if people who identify as that are referred to as "they"
the more conventional usage of "they" is for people/things whose gender you don't know
so taking limited evidence to assume the more convoluted possibility is inappropriate
<:annoyedPepe:347205246457610260>
whatever, "less common"
sorry i got called by a family member
<@!155401695138938881> don't be disingenuous
we're not calling your gender identity convoluted
i called your conclusion based on the evidence convoluted
because representation is important and i don't understand the shifts in that concept or how people perceive it
gazztrompla sounds funny to me because i can't not hear it as sassy
what the fuck kind of argument is that
okay, hold on a second
you're saying that a character doesn't need to scream their gender to the heavens in order for someone to know what it is
i agree
sometimes it's visually or contextually obvious
you're arguing that it's obvious in some way for kris's gender to be nonbinary instead of nonspecific
that's the part i disagree with
you've made a conclusion using the exact same amount of evidence that everyone has, but which to me suggests that we simply don't know
because that's a perfectly common trope in video games like this <:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
are you seriously trying to say you've never encountered this kind of idea
what kind of bullshit
yeah he does
romani
calls him a boy
get fucked idiot
dude i know majora's mask better than you
sit down
instances of link being called a boy in majora's mask include the old man in the seaside laboratory `Hmm? What is it, boy? Did you also come to watch the Zora eggs hatch?` kafei `I found him, green hat boy...` mysterious ghost guy in ikana valley `You are a boy of much vigor.` and like a dozen other cases
i'm still going through the list
<@!207991389613457408> `Boy, get your bow ready...` when they're about to be attacked on the way to town
GET
FUCKED
<:HYPERMEGAULTRAOMEGAGODLUL:350524757109899265>
sure mines
i don't actually care that much, i just don't agree with your conclusion
like, sure, perfectly valid to interpret kris as nonbinary
have a good run
"THE TUMS GANG"
fuck, my sides
misha got fucking nesquik'd
jesus fucking christ
literally every single time i think about it, there's another facet of the video that makes me laugh
like the fact that aside from the sound, that clip is completely unedit
i remember the fucking commercial
my fucking glottis hurts
oh okay so i was wrong
still, the water changing colors is great
ifnar needs a little competition, i'd allow it
i'm amazed how many miles girugamesh has traveled
that meme is from _2003_
hoo boy
all of a sudden i got a pang for hearing "ulric's fury"
bronte
aw, god damn
i'm sorry to hear that dero
are you guys going to take her in to get put down
oh, so she's got some time left, that's good
unfortunately the_donald was already basically dead
so this doesn't accomplish much
all of the people on there making things worse for people steadily moved to discord ever since it got quarantined
nice token move though
>deliberately removed itself
what the hell does that mean
then why did people throw such a shit fit about them getting quarantined, i thought that's what that was
misha, i don't think that they were trying to engage with different opinions even when they were more accessible to people in general
you know how ban-happy their mods were? that's part of why it became as bad as it was
it's like /r/conservative, anything that slightly deviates from the sub's chosen ideology gets you banned
i think that it was a publicly available forum of idiots only in the most technical sense
functionally they were every bit as insular as /pol/ is, just with greater visibility
what's the other 1%
we don't say "traps" here, that's a warning
is this another "retard" situation where it's been in contention about being banned for years
lmao
i'm going to entertain this tangent: here's the problem with that suggestion
how long until otokonoko gets subjected to the same kind of cultural shift that previous terms did and itself is deemed offensive
yeah precisely krato
we've already gone through this a number of times with various terms
pingus?
as a genuinely autistic person i don't really understand the discourse
i enjoy self-derogatory humor so i guess i should recuse myself
i was also teased about it
like, i'm not trying to blow past you and say you didn't get teased or adversely affected by it
i'm saying i was teased as well and i still don't understand the fuss
so i am recusing myself because clearly i don't understand
i just want to be friends with people and fuck around
BEHOLD
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228> my stuff <:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
dero, this is lit at its best
it needs to be a whirling maelstrom of nonsense at all times
<@!205026834205769748> don't post that fucking video
the nesquik one is funny because it's unexpected, that's literally just fucking brap content
i will kill brapposters
yes
<:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
Scrolling up and seeing woc post ">doug" multiple times was a strangely enjoyable experience
No one eats at pizza street anymore
Cartoon Network and the other kids channels are garbage dumps
We're very spoiled
No, it's much worse
Somehow
As awful as normal YouTube is, it doesn't prey on children

okay then
are you having a stroke, do you need medical attention
yes
okay settle down there sassy sally
the short answer is yes, bees produce honey far in excess of what they "need"
honey doesn't really go bad so in theory a beehive could just go on producing it for ages and they'd be fine
in practice though there's issues with leaving unharvested honey in domestic hives
<a:blair:424571787372658708>

this makes me want to listen to fucking delay lama remixes
even i don't know what you're talking about
the only spongebob ytps i remember at this point are steppin' on the m83 and mad square dancing
***√ëO IS MY CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
nyo is my chee by itself is such a mystifying image, but the context immediately makes it ten times better
never fails to make me laugh
wow, this is the original video from fucking 2008
that's impressive
i think i like actually remember this a bit now
the "IMAGINATION" segment tickled the taint on some of my neurons
"just so you could \*BEEP* in the box" also
spong
no
is it already time for game night???
also congrats on prelims
... oh...
i thought you were talking about doctoral preliminaries for a minute
yeah, prelims are like a test so you can be considered eligible to become a doctor
it's bullshjit
i definitely don't think ERS is a good idea for online play
more conventional card games sure
we should also limit TTS games
i want to try and include as many people as possible
which will necessarily mean free shit
exactamundo
i'm good to play some TTS tomorrow though
i've played that a few times, it's good
takes a bit for me to get into though
if we can get enough people in it'll be great
yeah, we can have a game night role
someone start gathering a list of names
or rather i can just do it myself in a bit
<:SHIALABEOUF:533444597347778572>
we got another one lads
wales' power grows
most of those sound pretty reasonable
reparations is still a touchy subject but is worth at least exploring the possibilities and ramifications
defunding the police point blank is probably not good but heavy reform is explicitly needed
everything else just sounds like common sense
well, yes
i think the point is that most or all of these points are being presented as some kind of left wing bogey man, regardless of veracity or relevance
most of these ideas are things that we should be striving for as a society to begi nwith
also why is reparations so hard to imagine
to be clear, i'm not suggesting cutting a check for every family of a given race
that would be imbecilic
reparations as a social reform, though, makes a lot of sense
like, spending a lot of money on infrastructure development and getting historically impoverished neighborhoods up to snuff with education, job opportunities, etc
no, sein, that's fucking moronic
anyone who talks about reparations in terms like that deserves to be ridiculed
what the fuck? no
reparations is a real word that has meaning and relevance here
a lot of people being confused about what it means doesn't rob it of that significance
well what the hell else should we call it
<:annoyedPepe:347205246457610260>
abandoning words because other people fuck up their usage is letting the linguistic terrorists win
is that what you want?
unacceptable, clearly you need to be detained in insert guantanamo bay joke here
yeah, despite us speaking strongly no one here is like
histrionic or upset
it's colloquial
i also used to say boogieman but i saw bogeyman being used more
one of my relatives i was visiting with today watches fox news religiously, and even fox was all like "CASES SKYROCKETING" and showed footage of people freaking out
it was very sensational but also might help make people stop fucking about
tim horton's was great the first time i went to canada, but it kind of sucked when i went a couple years ago
yeah, that's what i heard too
FUCKING BRS
RUINING EVERYTHING
saved by the bot for now, but your days are numbered
dunkin donuts is fucking trash
yeah, don't eat there
do they know why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch
actually, all of the mcdonalds i happened to go to in canada were noticeably better than in america?
it was kind of eerie actually
their food actually tasted fresh and not like sterile, frozen shit
Welcome to the only game in town.
yeah that got excessive

moonjail, why do you have shitty opinions
i expected better of you
and there it is
my carrier has officially reached its final destination as a functional, fully-equipped station out in the black
out in the system Angosk RT-I d9-0
it's got enough money to take care of operating costs for the next five years
my work... is done
everything about the last month or so has been completely exhausting
we need a break
can july be good instead of another month of bullshit
those are stocks
market's been completely delusional since the pandemic started
corporations reporting record losses and closures, and the market keeps going up
45 million people losing their jobs in the US and the market takes it like it's nothing
doesn't make any sense
i mean, who knows at this point
the last time that the value of the market was highly inflated due to overconfidence though, the great depression happened
is that the day ticker
what does week/month look like
"i asked you a question pls respond"
hm, maybe that doesn't cut deep enough
i think i agree with that tensei
i've watched maury and the bachelor a few times in a group setting
maury is great for just complete schlock and the bachelor is good for faux drama
maury gets fucking _wild_ sometimes, at certain points they'll just abandon all pretenses and bring out strippers and start blasting airhorns
at one point some woman found out someone wasn't the father of her child, so she ran into the back and promptly knocked over a ladder, so that the text in the thumbnail was "Not the ladder!"
my friends and i brought that up for weeks
i think with just the right show it could be excellent stream material
especially watching makin ree because it's basically the opposite of kino/rational/whatever
didn't we talk about this earlier today
the conclusion was, if i recall, "consumerism"
also i'm looking into tiny houses
did you know there are functional houses as small as 80 square feet
that's fucking nuts
why would you buy a tiny house
make one yourself <:TenseiFace:243174946178596864>
i used to live in an apartment so small that the bathroom was, i estimate, about 20 square feet
and that is not an underestimate, it was fucking abysmal
the toilet and sink were so close that i could comfortably sit down and wash my hands at the same time
that place sucked, but it was cheap
that's 4 x 5 feet
you're fitting a shower, a toilet, and a sink
people don't need big houses is the thing
like, families? sure
but individual people don't need that much space
right, good point
let's get to "home ownership" first
man, you plan on having hobbies that take up space? sounds like you've already got money to work with
maybe it'd be easier if those people had a workshop
nyeh
housing costs in general are way too high because real estate gets bought up to manufacture scarcity
unless you already have a shit ton of money to work with, you're not getting into the housing market anytime soon
we are the burg
we will assimilate your flavor
stone, brick
plaster and drywall are exclusively for the interior
the exterior is usually wood
as well as the frame
if i built a house with 300 sq ft interior out of cinderblock materials, it'd cost a little over a thousand dollars to complete the exterior walls
fascinating
god, not another one
fucking mtg
the name of the channel changes frequently based on what we're doing or stuff that's happening
every time WTC updates we change the name to #wtc-update for a few days
+progress
god damn it wales, come on
it's been TWO MONTHS
some people would honestly prefer that
i mean, has he said anything about it
also yeah dero join us for karate kid if you feel like it
oh shit
that's perfectly understandable
as mandated by internet law, yes
someone who fears retribution
perhaps rightly
i was going to say
if the vote fails, everyone who put their name on it is temp banned for sixteen years

the instrument of my own destruction... was me
i'll change it later though, karate kid stream is on
we leave the name up so people can see it and join in
congrats mag, how was it
so what you're saying is that spat is the new war and peace
this is great news for my already massively overinflated ego
yeah i'm free
ah, you're on indeed too
i've conducted a number of those assessments
they're kind of dumb
DIDN'T YOU HEAR TENSEI TIPSY? IT'S _CRINGE_
HOW DARE YOU BRING CRINGE HERE
i know, i surprise even myself sometimes
lord knows i gotta be simpin' on the ladies all the time
that's why i deal with nat
she's intolerable to all but the most simpy people
nat you are a walking talking menace to public health
no one BUT simps could stand talking to you, FACT
maybe they enjoy your soda blood or your intense gremlin spirit
swish, just reading that made my lips curl in distaste
i'm impressed
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
anyway, tipsy posting screenshots of an aptitude test is fine
those things are dumb without exception
still don't think explicitly asking for help is good but she didn't do that
nat, i don't have to simp you
you're my underling, i tolerate you as a matter of course
yes, you work for me, is there some kind of misunderstanding here
i'm trying and i can't find a way to continue this joke
so you're dismissed
get outta my sight imp
<@!513802258643943425> the movie isn't over yet
we have about half an hour left
it was a great movie tipsy
should have watched it with us
the original one
<@!165162590878695424> last week or so of october 2016
it's kind of weird to consider new orleans as an eastern coast city
like, that's technically correct but also super unusual
gulf coast city sounds way more sensible
no, louisiana has access to the gulf of mexico
i'd be down for that, never went to nawlins
the americans will have an advantage though
:doug:
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
good doug
is that her food
whatever it is, i don't like it
yeah, if that's actual shit then you're getting canned misha
why do you eat stuff that looks like actual diarrhea
marshmallow peeps on pizza might actually be one of the most evil food combinations i have ever seen
shitty pizza is something that no one should be allowed to get away with
I found them roughly the same to be honest
The slowed roll mechanic doesn't really change that much, and status effects didn't matter terribly much
Bluffs and debuffs were both pretty much the same too
When will Harry Potter finally die as a franchise
Like, 2100?
That's funny until you realize that star wars has been around for almost half a century

no
<@!266807632390520833> rorsasch got a shit ton of people thrown in prison over the years
they knew it was him and wanted revenge
they don't need to say it in that scene specifically, it's mentioned elsewhere in the movie
especially that scene later with the small guy
what
no, you literally JUST said that it's not clear in that scene
it is clear, it's explicitly filled in by context elsewhere

i am seething for no particular reason
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
anyway i'm down to play sometimes but it better be good
something*
i'm just tired and slightly angery
oh right we were going to do a game night role
let me repurpose terraria or whatever we have
who wants the game night role
betrayal on haunted hill is like a murder mystery game
well, not really
it's supernatural horror tropes
you and your friends enter an abandoned mansion where each room is a tile that you place down when you enter it for the first time
there are various effects associated with each room and certain events that take place in them
at some point one of the party members is turned into the antagonist, which is any of a variety of B movie villains
vampires, frankenstein, zombies, mummies
etc
then the goal is to escape from the house or defeat the villain
it's honestly quite fun
if you have TTS you should join in
is it still on sale
wow, gitaxian with the worst take
asking again, anyone want the game night role
just making sure
no, tabletop simulator
done
sure carl

this is what non TTS owners are missing out on
strictly speaking we already have six players so it'll be hard/impossible for you to join, but you can always spectate
actually we do have one more spot open
nevermind we're not doing that
whatever ree
holy shit this game is hilarious
it was hard to make the game work online so we're doing superfight now
join if you want
on tonight's episode of superfight: a sharpshooter versus stephen hawking

what the actual fuck is this game--what
oh i know what happened
this is what i was asking about
woc demodded

nat banned
thanks bees
jesus fucking christ my head hurts
between "Sharpshooter versus Stephen Hawking" and "Cum-blind Yugi" everything was just completely off the rails
yeah, i was going to play that at the start of the second round but decided it would be a good game finisher
god, my head hurts
that's the hardest i've laughed since poop ballsack
nat, why do you fight me so
when will you finally admit that we're friends
ü•™
do i want to be
it makes you wonder how many times that's happened over the course of the earth's history
i need some fucking ibuprofen, damn
that is fucking adorable
strictly speaking we could totally do a checker's tournament, we could almost certainly find a good free version and just ran brackets
fair enough
if i don't have a job by the end of the month i get kicked out of the house so i'm right there with you
b3es, i meant for people who don't own TTS
jourth
<@!146014279529791488> you get your wish but only for 30 seconds
are you ready
no
the contract bearer must be present
oh boy, it's good to be back
early canwc is by far my favorite part
late canwc is only better in the sense that it's gotten to the point (mostly)
stylistically i've always felt it was kind of inferior to the beginning
the most noticeable thing is the keymashing, where it was very understated at the start but is now basically ubiquitous
every single word is significantly misspelled to the point that it's almost exhausting
"nothing important"
i'm typing this up in my subreddit post, but the difference between late and early canwc is like a mentally deficient adult slathering their fingers all over the keyboard versus a demented child exploring making webcomics for the first time
`the chest of continents will not open again until punishment time is over`
stfu
if you've been primed to hate korra because of how other people have reacted to it, you might enjoy it a bit better
that's what happened to me
and i still hated korra
thanks ifnar
i agree with that superficially
but like, that's just a stylistic thing
i don't really think the style evolved well over the tenure of the comic so far
but that's okay, because the style isn't the only thing going for it
i was and now again interested in the overall premise
i earnestly want to find out why most things are shitty but some are not
i'd like to know about the greater scale of this work, which is something that i feel is in tune with how homestuck proper used to be
that all being put aside, even if i don't like the style in general for it, o's ability as a creator are unquestionably improving over time
{s] fl1p or whatever it's called was genuinely awesome
hell, almost all of the flashes are genuinely good
see, the fact that you're even able to ask that question though
that's interesting to me
how many times have we talked about homestuck proper in that capacity
"was hussie going off a plan or was he making it up as he went along"
it's just an inscrutable, amazing quality for a work to have that it keeps you guessing both in-universe and out
it's just that this story is presented as a piece of shit <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
tallness offers a lot of benefits
it hasn't happened more than a few times, but whenever i'm in the store and an older person asks me to reach for something on the top shelf? those are the times i feel like my life has meaning
you're right tensei, i'm gay for being helpful
andrew what the fuck is going on with that image
i interpreted this part
as your main body, like from the torso down
and the rest was a garbled mess of extraneous limbs
we have one of those, it's nice
i don't think it looks that bad
it's when it gets old or too used that it becomes really gross
but a newly upholstered leather couch? pretty alright tbh
it has a unique temperature feeling to it
very chilly at first, but warms comfortably
and it gets right into your buttcrack
oh, as like apartment furniture? i guess it wouldn't be as good
i usually associate it with offices
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> get rekt nerd
that wasn't very cash money of you
what did you do to keep infection rates down
no, i wasn't trying to make a point
i was literally asking
it was the other way around wasn't it
some dutch people traded away stuff and the japanese reverse engineered it
oh okay, so other stuff that should be bog-standard for this situation
speaking outside of matters like supply, masks aren't necessary but they're a "better safe than sorry" precaution
i mean, i don't think there's much room for discussion there
the united states' handling of the virus has been an abject failure
of course
it's not just the masks, it's everything
masks are just visually apparent
everything should have been on complete lockdown except for like groceries from day 1, and the lockdown shouldn't have been lifted after only a few months
but you get people who are outright defying whatever lockdown orders we already have or governors lifting them for entire states
it puts everyone at risk
there's not much point in discussing the origins of it anymore, i think
although i might be mistaken there, considering china is apparently seeing another disease that could be just as bad
are there any new reports about the swine-flu thing
careful, icarus
catcalling is a fundamental aspect of the common man
the salt of the earth
spare no expense, djreeb
i think i've physically witnessed catcalling one time, but i absolutely do not doubt it happens frequently
i don't exactly go outside that much
man tensei, that reminds me of a fun interaction i had yesterday when i was out taking care of stuff
i have a "2016 SUCKS" shirt that i bought at the end of that year
i was wearing it out because i didn't feel like putting on a more contemporary outfit
as i left a gas station, a sassy black woman took one look and was like "mm mm, that should say 2020"
and amazingly i didn't drop any spaghetti, i was like "man, you fuckin' said it" like a normal, socially adapted human being
nah carlarc, i shit you not
<@!108778093631533056> settle down
b3es, carlarc is being flippant, this is pretty standard operating procedure around here
also i'm from america too, but i think it's perfectly valid to observe where we do things poorly
it's just that saying "america sucks" is shorthand for "some people in america do really shitty things"
which is an objective truth
wow, we actually haven't visited this train of thought in a long time
b3es, the thing is that we've talked about a lot of this stuff already
including this conversation
and including talking about that conversation
the conclusion we've reached in the past is that it sucks and we don't really want to condone people being shitty _explicitly_ for the purpose of riling others up
but i don't think that's what carlarc was doing, it was an unfortunate side effect of being flippant
this chat is oriented towards a more confrontational style of communication
it's about building up a tolerance to harsh rhetoric
i don't think you're an ass
not now, gnawms
i'm watching this unfold
~~dance~~ reconcile for my amusement, puppets
oh god, oh fuck
misha is diving in
what is that dark stain under hsi head
is that sweat or spit
it's literally one person bumping us off the rails
or bumping rails amiright
but yeah <@!207991389613457408> shut up
official warning
thanks for listening, son
DAE donald dump LOL
you're all simps
anyway, settle down would you
if you've got beef, take it outside or i will kill
the real question though: which one is DIO and which one is jotaro
with that thought...
i think it works in any channel but i'm not sure
haven't had to freeze anywhere except here <:TenseiFace:243174946178596864>
damn that worked
canadians in general are nice, or at least present as nice, but the ones that speak primarily in french are all bastards
what the hell is going on
I'LL KIDNAP A THOUSAND TIMBITS BEFORE I LET THIS COMPANY DIE
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
DINGUS, WHY
there's something that feels sullied about pinning a fart joke
DO NOT BRAPPOST
ONLY WARNING FOR WHOLE CHANNEL
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
moon banned for three hours
misha also lit banned
husky too
what the FUCK has gotten into you people today
but it frequently did get that bad carl
plom
i'm not writing about this
too shameful
if someone else wants to write it then sure
i just don't now anymore guys
i feel adrift
carl, i don't think there's much more to be said
i don't want to write about an altercation explicitly framed around fucking farts
it's gross, and i've already described brapposting in an older entry
it would be redundant
i'd watch that for a dollar
lit has been getting too shitposty
today was a prime example
i don't want to get rid of shitposting entirely but i'm going to be more free about handing out bans
miles per hour?
eesh, maybe i really should remod makin
he would know what to do
too bad we lost him in the war...
i basically give zero shits about twitter
my opinion of twitter is about as bad as it can get
i don't mean homestuck twitter, although that is also true
i mean twitter as a platfor
it fucking sucks
homestuck twitter is just kind of what arose out of that
so they suck, but it's hard to tell whether the people on homestuck twitter would suck as bad on a different platform or if they gravitated towards the worst platform naturally, or what
right, i was going to ask how that's going
so, same old?
so i just learned about the comic maker stonetoss, and all i have to say is: what the actual fuck?
yeah, i've seen meme formats i think but i didn't know about any of this formally
what the _actual_ fuck
is this guy still making comics????????
jesus christ
<@!207991389613457408> literally every time this guy shows up i can't help but think of "OH NO HE'S HOT" and then gachi, in that order
<@!168980988477702145> i don't remember if i answered you, but nah we don't have a real schedule for game night
i think it's just whenever people bring it up and enough are interested
that honestly seems better than trying to have a rigorous schedule
tomitake is kind of enigmatic
what's your P-P-P-P-POINT
YWAH, WOW
whoops caps
obligatory HAO... SO KYUTE...
anyway, you were right mint, tomitake is really chill
i enjoy him
someone feed gpt2 the entirety of game of champions so we can get new and cool pokemon stories
SHUT UP, DAMMIT
yes
<:BOOMER:576174394720911400>
i was going to say, visually there isn't much going on
you got a little synergy with monty though and that was fun
quality content, 7/10 i would listen
oh yeah, that makes sense
look it's been a while and i never actually did titanfall 2 multiplayer
i should definitely join in if i'm free next time you guys do it
seems appropriate to me
stop playing on a toaster
well
i might be able to help out, if you want
depends on the nature of the problem
i was going to say, this is helpful to know what your computer is made of, but what's actually happening with it that's causing problems
like, describe to me what happens when you play vidya
also i can't fucking handle this game sometimes
yeah, that's definitely a lot
normal resting temp for a processor should only be about 30-40 degrees C
they can get higher than that but it shouldn't be idling at 64 C
hell, that was happening with terraria too wasn't it
i know terraria isn't very well optimized but that should be more than enough to handle the game
maybe thermal paste will help
wh
is it a laptop or a desktop
can you pry open the case and take a look
take a picture of it and send it
or i guess i could circle what you're looking for
wait a second, what the fuck
why is there a little caution sign next to the graphics card
oh okay, so that one doesn't matter
the top one is the important GPU, so that's fine
carl, open up your task manager
go to the performance tab and scroll down
you should see this

sure
maybe
show us the rest of the list in task manager
jesus yeah, what the actual fuck
hm, true
i have basically nothing going on right now
lmao, try closing chrome and see what happens
THAT'S HALF OF YOUR MEMORY
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
try playing terraria now you fucking wiener
fine, fine
if that's the case then it's probably your CPU bottlenecking you
get the thermal paste, apply it, and we'll see what happens
also yeah, clean out the air filters
carl's cpu runs at like 64C even when idling
```There's not much here... but there's a lot here you can't find anywhere else.``` spat.txt
do you not have money for thermal paste??
it's only like 7 USD
https://www.amazon.com/Arctic-Silver-AS5-3-5G-Thermal-Paste/dp/B0087X728K
if that was too much i was going to demand your paypal address so i could drop that hot american bux on your ass
shitcoin made me laugh, thanks
sure nik give me your paypal
<:ree:475542526791516170> did i stutter motherfucker
in seriousness, i kind of like dropping money on random chat members, although it's definitely not a good practice objectively
i remember one time i bought nostalgic a copy of minecraft and also made him go get a burger
that was fun
sure qweq
gimme
i will buy you thermal paste you fucking money
urseeyes
yes
i don't need to send it to your address you fucking moron
i would just paypal you some money
alright qweq look and see
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
ayyy
no, keep it
it converted to brl
anyway it's yours
yes, i'm a simp for my friends
it's official
yeah, discount is automatically applied on any purchase 30 bucks or more
only does it once though
don't joke about that tm
or about phantos either
uncle funkle
aliens is a sci-fi action movie
alien is a sci-fi horror movie
the force awakens
what's going on here
that's a good snake friend
not spicy enough
jesus christ, why
these arguments are both terrible, filled with gotchas and not actually a substantive discussion of the issues in question
start interacting with at least a bit more respect or you're both getting channel banned for the night
reducing someone's points in a disingenuous way and mocking them for it is in fact disrespectful
i'm talking to both of you
```‚ÄúBruh I think racists should get free cards to be racists everywhere and enable other racists to come out of the woodwork hehehe‚Äù```
this is not what b3es is arguing
stop being a jackass
i've issued the warning, follow it or don't
that is a far more cogent way of explaining yourself than what you said before
do that more and the other thing less
uh
hm
i think it's important to remember that principle, but just because information is biased doesn't mean it's inaccurate either
even if a headline tries to misrepresent an issue, if there's a video attached to it, you can use your eyes and ears to make a more direct judgment
b3es, i understand and kind of agree with what you're saying, but there's also a larger reality out there that indicates otherwise
i think that the actual rate of police brutality as a whole, generalized thing is not like
well, it's not absolute
i don't go outside fearing for my life that i'll be shot by the police
but what godtiermeme's describing is also happening
there are real, frequent instances of police brutality, and it does happen during protests and riots
the actual frequency is an item of contention, but the point of fact here is that it _does_ happen and it's a problem that needs to be addressed
okay, so it sounds like we're all basically on the same side here, and there are just some finer points of disagreement
this feels better than how the discussion was proceeding before
<:RikerHowHigh:426046714601013260> ü™ë
i think i can do better than that
<:RikerHowHigh:426046714601013260> 
ü¶µ 
ü™ë ü¶µ
meh, i tried
honestly that's making me laugh by itself
fuck riker's weird sitting down motion
i wouldn't know, i've never looked up riker's dick
the number one's number one, i guess you'd call it
no, i didn't
<@!146014279529791488> are you ready
<@!146014279529791488> I SAID ARE YOU READY MOTHERFUCKER
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
fuck it, i'm banning carl _now_
i'm gonna do it
it's habbeding

burning?
DN?
i'm very interested to hear your description of the feeling
which was an unncessarily complicated way of saying "i'm interested to hear how it feels"
but i've tried charcoal facewash before and it felt vaguely like when you get freezerburn
it's less common that the tap water is literally unsafe to drink
that usually happens when infrastructure breaks down
more commonly it's that the tap water tastes foul because of too many minerals or something
our water out in the country was like that
neat
the elusive cyrene face pic
that's good
abstract/indirect brapposting is arguably okay as long as it's actually fucking funny
nesquik was good because it wasn't JUST brapposting, it was its own whole thing
even just thinking about it is making me chortle
alright, someone must have it
nesquik is so violently horrific that you can't help being caught off guard
yeah woc, that one got me pretty good
like, i was initially pissed off,  but the absurdity of it just got to me after a bit
i'll definitely record the next superfight
probably record all of our game nights to be honest, they're great
are you talking about the cheese gif
hm
we do seem to be using the word "pog" a lot lately
i'll see if there's any general interest
Our very own <@!504441941534965762> created an image that might just be worthy of being turned into an emote. We have some slots leftover and I leave the vote up to you, the general public: should we make this an emote, yes or no?

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/486203234868789278/728131281967120504/PogStrider.png
vote in announcements or else
vote in announcements or die
the cheese gif i saw is just absurd enough that it made me laugh in a really weirded out sense
like, i just couldn't process the thing i was witnessing
also vote in announcements or die
This is what the emote looks like sized down, by the way. We can do a version with no text if it ruins it. <:davePog:728132590741225583>
<:davePog:728132590741225583>
i think i agree with having no text
<@!504441941534965762> make a version with no text and i think we'll add it to the server
challenge yourself
go for caliborn
you're a shite emote
pog is perfectly valid
just because something gets used a lot doesn't mean it sucks
what are you, a hipster
Welcome the newest emote: <:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
<:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
<:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
<:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
i am still here
i watch always
that's a lie, i'm usually dead
<:dabeegMayahn:679423476268007424>
THE VOICE
THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE
<:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
no guarantee we'll turn all of them into an emotes, but this one at least was great
keep up the good work
is it time
are you ready
the contract is fulfilled
i was bound by blood law to do this
also yeah no altgen invasion or i kil
okay, that's enough
it lasted for about five minutes
i'll say that's enough
but by all means homer, please continue

elemental metals do not count as stones
stones are typically crystallized minerals, which are themselves created from compounds arranged in a geometric pattern that confers stability
```A rock is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter. It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed.```
by this loose definition, salt crystals could count as a type of stone
ROCK TYPE AND SOURCE CHART
PURISTS VERSUS RADICALISTS
bad to the stone
SHUT UP, DAMMIT
i was born july 30th
you know what's exactly 9 months before that
dick all
actually i guess it could be thanksgiving
no you fucking moron, lead is an elemental metal
do i need to choke a bitch
`Baby Jesus is an asshole.`
nah he probably fucked mary magdalene
you remember that time when you spilled a hot chicken pot pie all over your hand
may you not be found wanting
apathetic
also yes
i just say "areligious"
it is firmly not a factor in my life at all
would probably depend on what it's exposed to
if it's exposed to air it'll still degrade, it'll just take a while
if it's exposed to nothing somehow, then it'll probably degrade at the speed of half-life of its components
mostly carbon and calcium
no one knows for sure but we can hazard some good guesses
homo erectus, homo neanderthalis, and then some offshoots like australopithicus
denisovans too, sure
yes
IN THESE TRYING TIMES WE JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK. BUY OUR FUCKING CRAP.
do you believe in fate, or do you believe in free will
i don't know. you told me to make the burgers, therefore i make the burgers. in that case it must be destiny.
_nods_ very good. i'm very pleased to hear that, djreeb.
yours will be a life of servitude. you will not leave the borglar restaurant, for i am your god. you will not be fed, i will take you out of school, so that you can make more borglars.
paradoxical
that's enough, get outta here
<@!125433170047795200> 
>look in the rearview mirror
>see humanity
>drive faster
also damn, backlog was fucking spicy today
i need to stop sleeping, i always miss so much
'm excited for it
stop talking about condiment ice cream you freaks
i say as i'm late to the party
what the hell is wrong with the world
we need an actual reckoning
i see people regularly say that rogue one is good and i'm always shocked by that
mines says it from time to time and i always expect better of them
no, it's not
damn yark, that's rough
sorry, i just came back into the discussion, i was busy
UNBECOMING
do you think lord english will go to the miss skaia pageant in 2009 in the medium? if so, will he become my new best friend?
fucking christ misha, i feel so bad but i can't stop laughing
"Why did you fuck that child?" "Look, I had sex with my own mother for eleven years, okay?"
i've always found that weird too, honestly
we've already talked about that a bit carl
the only thing we thought of was going back to IRC
which is just this but less complicated/accessible
it has to be a real time chat application
it can't be a blogosphere or some shit
well, maybe we should get that contingency set up just in case
fugg : DDDD
also it's never a dumb argument to try and argue contingencies
i think that if discord goes down and there's no immediately recognizable alternative, going back to text only will be prudent
that's why i said IRC
infrastructure is already there
just make channels and shit
that's just how it used to work, we weren't able to send raw files
we had to send links to stuff
in a way it was almost better, it kept shitposting to a minimum
also text-based games were way less intrusive
so the bot could have stuff that made it more fun for everyone
i think that sort of thing is regarded as outdated now, though, so eh
surrendering the homestuck account to whoever the fuck got it was a mistake
image archival would probably have to be done on local devices honestly
or we would buy websites specifically for hosting services
like, what's to stop us from independently buying a web domain and using it for archival purposes
20 GB of data can go a long way
actually no
i may be hosting our pins on imgur but i've also got local copies
after losing my data a couple of times i never keep only one copy
that too b3es
i just got done building another computer for a family member, i feel pretty comfortable with the process now
i bet if i saved up some money i could buy a really cheap computer setup and install ubuntu on it, host everything there
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
holy fuck
i hope everything's alright sein
does it come with any perks like telekinesis
I KNOW!
it's nesquik, did you expect chocolatey milk
even outside of your bloodline disease, i would argue no
it's highly likely that future generations will experience a significantly worse standard of living than us
i'm talking about global warming mostly
no, it doesn't
i thought you said "tayne" for a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9yU80sa2hI
why would you do this
you're really, unironically asking
he's a big guy
he got beat up in prison and was horribly disfigured to the point that he's constantly in pain, the mask diffuses painkillers and some other stuff to make him stronger
what kind of question is that
'e bought? pomp it
all chickens are pregnant constantly
okay i've had enough of this
i kind of want to stream something because i'm in a good mood for the first time in a week and a half
i don't know what though
tensei mentioned pokemon clover, would that actually be a good idea
i was already planning on doing a private nameless firered mod run, which has in-house nuzlocke capabilities
but i think nuzlocke would actually make it worse
because i'd be concerned about losing my team so i'd overtrain all of them
let me see what's in my steam list
or i could always do like a gamecube game or some shit
i haven't played windwaker in many years
just a 24/7 stream of that emote
that one probably has more entertainment value
also that, yes
that's the main thing that's stopping me tensei
it's probably not going to be entertaining
even if it's a 4chan mod
i mean, i can turn animations off, but grinding is always a problem
not even bred? weak
the answer is probably no
yeah that's part of the bertie bott's lineup, i have one of those packs right now
the soap one actually does taste like soap, i was amazed
thaaaaaaaaaat's capitalism!
`4d3d3d3 Engaged.`
alright, finally gonna get my old streams uploaded to youtube and look for something to play
i'm really feeling wind waker right about now but maybe something new instead
as tensei would say, gotta stop spinning my wheels with a z
i still haven't played la mulana 2
is it not
what are you a wiener
oh
yeah, i played la-mulana 1
not on stream
i think it might be fun as a stream thing? people would get to yell at me for missing shit
and it wouldn't be as tedious as going through it alone
suddenly i am very sold on this idea
so did the first one
i did beat it, i just cheated
deal with it nerd
i won't use a wlakthrough with mulana 2 as long as i have people watching who can guide me in the right direction, angrily
yes makin
i got to the fucking credits
also alright then tensei, i'm gonna pick this up and give it a whirl ASAP
hm
there is vodka here, i could feasibly do that
not a shot though, a sip
but also i probably won't do that

i don't even remember mantras
i haven't played la-mulana in almost 2 years
alright game is downloaded, i'll begin streaming as soon as my video is done uploading
try seagate misha
i buy all my harddrives from them, they're usually pretty reliable
wait, why would WP do that
point taken
back in 2012? or whenever it was introduced? it might have
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
how has WP been this badly managed so consistently
it's depressing
man, those were the days
anyway, about five minutes and then i'll start
what do you want me to do when you metabolize bred
"i've been coasting off the royalties since"
woc, knock that shit off
alright it's time to begin <https://www.twitch.tv/drewlinki>
THAT WAS FUN
whoops caps
<@!191265659936702464> i have just been informed of "joppiesauce"
what is it
lmao
that sounds fucking terrible
also my girlfriend wanted me to say this to you" `"omg oepsie woepsie det joppie saus iz stuckie wuckie een mit pommesfrites"
`
she can't get over that one meme about the trains getting "stuckie wuckie"
yeah, she finds dutch in general kind of weird but loves that one
i just realized what i'm saying makes no sense
she's a linguist and studies a shit ton of different languages for fun
practically fluent in german and studies dutch occasionally
you know what, nevermind
my explanations probably aren't going to help this
neil? is that you?
a firm no from carlarc
both are acceptable
this hairsplitting cannot go on
i demand you cease
is subnautica below 0 approaching completion
fuck it, maybe i should play dark souls randomized finally
nah just 1
you know what, nevermind
suddenly my motivation is gone
apparently the like
item and enemy randomizers are separate
yeah, that too
i think i'll give it a bit more time and come back later
you grew a second head?
fascinating
oh yeah i forgot that i bought total warhammer 2 on sale
time to see what that's like
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
what was the last tekken title
wait, so what exactly spurred them to remove their sponsorship
i thought that was a smash thing
holy shit
damn dude
```Do not diddle kiiiiiids```
pretty sure it's someone twitching his ears from behind
"that you always wanted" stop putting words in my mouth
are you guys feeling okay today
uh
<@!207991389613457408> i'm having an issue with total warhammer 2
i think that i got my ass whooped so hard that my original legendary lord was fucking killed and now i can't progress
i recruited a second commander to replace him but i can't do anything
is all hope lost
high elves, normal
this is only turn 3
not my first battle
i actually did really well in the first one
but i went and tried to get the glittering tower, had a valiant defeat, then defended lothern and got a decisive defeat
cavil is basically my only unit right now
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

i have plenty of money i think, but it won't allow me to recruit more troops i think
i mean that i'm basically stuck, the game won't allow me to progress to next turn
every time i try to do something, cavill just says "RIDICULOUS" "MISGUIDED" "UNWISE"

i don't know what recruiting buildings there are
d
i mean, i have a garrison
THE DRUCHII HAVE NO MORALS
THE DRUCHII _SEEK_ THE WIDOWMAKER
what
i have no idea what that means
oh, tyrion isn't dead, he's just resting
you know, maybe my game is glitched
because i really cannot do ANYTHING
the advisor is stuck on this tip
i'm gonna chalk this up to broken
i'm reloading
okay, i'm back before the glittering tower battle
aight that seemed to fix it
i just retreated lmao
there's no way i would be able to judge myself unless i was actually in that position
***DETECTED***
what is wrong with you
it went wrong on a lot of levels
what do you think they did right
what, are you saying "I'M THE AVATAR AND YOU'VE GOTTA DEAL WITH IT" didn't tickle your fancy when the show came out
first
my condolences to your mother
it's a pretty cool kind of organism
i didn't do very much with it though, it was just observational studies
holy shit
the entire rem lezar movie is on youtube
https://youtu.be/k9it86bsUVA?t=2424
yeah, glomeromycete refers to members of the phylum glomeromycota
which is just fungi that establish close associations with roots of plants
there is no joke, it's just rem lezar
we need to watch it sometime
oh

i want to watch the room again soon for some reason
it's been a while, hasn't it
i'll try and find the copy that tommy wiseau uploaded to youtube himself
also https://www.wfla.com/community/health/coronavirus/alabama-students-hold-covid-19-parties-with-prize-for-first-sick-person/
es ist freitag, meine fetten Freunde
welp
oh that's good
moonjai, i'm reminded
do you want back on the team yet
also when are we going to watch the room
shut up woc, do you have your fireworks yet
then what's the problem
let's shoot roman candles at people
amazing
one can hope
how about this saturday evening for the ro--wait nevrmind that's the 4th of july
how about wednesday evening next week
not ready enough
i need more alcohol
oh yeah, me too
damn
i think mine could be themed easily enough
let me see what i can do
ah HAH
that doesn't look half bad
got that shit ready
anyway, i'll get the room ready for next week
i'm excited
this is required reading for anyone who'll join the stream https://www.avclub.com/a-viewers-guide-to-the-room-1798215944
nah, the disaster artist isn't actually that good of a companion movie
it's kind of funny but also pointless and not a faithful adaptation of the book
``` ‚ÄùCancer!‚Äù
Lisa‚Äôs mother alludes to having it once and then never mentions it again. Also, when she touches Lisa on the nose, some people shout ‚ÄúI put my evil inside you!‚Äù```
look, these traditions are all great
get the stick out of your rotten ass
these could easily work with a twitch chat, at least in some capacity
add a spoon emote and you're pretty much golden
see? perfect
now SHUT UP, DAMMIT
```‚Ä¢ At one point, two characters will show up in Tommy‚Äôs apartment. They will be fucking. No one will know who they are, thus it is appropriate to shout ‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù whenever they appear onscreen.

‚Ä¢ It is also appropriate to shout this when the actor playing Peter (the psychologist) disappears (maybe he was looking at the camera too much?), only to be replaced by another actor who looks nothing like him. Yes, just ‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù```
this is my favorite one
god, i got to see the room at a midnight showing back in virginia
it was fucking _great_
people were drunk and throwing the football around the entire movie
it was so fucking loud and raucous
if you have a chance to see the room in a theater, please do so, it's an amazing experience

this sounds like something woc would say
```This one actually requires a buddy. I did it last time I went. Basically, you each drink half of one of the huge things of RockStar, then each dump half a fifth of bourbon into the RockStar can and stir it. You‚Äôre sacrificing coherency in the end, but it‚Äôs a blast.``` what the fuck <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
we also need to watch the robin williams popeye movie
why does it sound like a superpower
man, i'm surprised by how much i want to watch the room again
NEXT WEEK
BE THEREERE
why do i have so much energy all of a sudden
+progress
HURRY UP
<:ree:475542526791516170>
maybe
i should be trying to get to bed but to hell with that
what would we play
that doesn't seem right
oh well
<@&711911237700681789> anyone up
who wanna play poker or something better
mmmmmmm
you are weak, your bloodline is weak and you will not survive the winter
your ass is next nat
don't get comfy
what the fuck stop talking about your own ass you dumb lesbianic narcissist
because i crave victory
if we're VCing i need to get on the computer
how many people are even playing
that's three
that's FOUR
spiral i'll buy you a copy if you want to join in
also poker's easy, we can teach you
aight, one sec
is this you

fuck you woc, i hate that that made me laugh
cy, i'll buy you a copy of tts to join in next time
it's half off right now so i'm raining copies like a pimp
dero would you join us for poker night
i'll get you a copy too
right now
and also various nights in the future
it's not always going to be poker, we play whatever we feel like
last time we did superfight, which made me laugh so hard i nearly got a migraine
it's 2.5 GB
also <@!184545248930693120> what's your fucking steam ID you giant turd
then i need to friend you
sent you a copy
because life is short, qweq
we're taking advantage of our youth and the energy of friendship
now shut the fuck up and get in here
game is "HSD Game Night" password "wieners"
sure spiral
we're in VC, too
tera is streaming through voice chat if you want to join us that way
hsd game night irl: https://youtu.be/_CfCa0HGvCE?t=79
yeah we're playing poker
join if you can
this is so fucking fun
that was really great
i'm definitely down for texas hold'em next time
<@!86605650976571392> congratulations on your victory
whenever we feel like it
ez lyfe
i like the idea of having a mutually agreed upon last hand where we go all-in and flip the table
i'm glad we're doing shit like this, it's very fun
how was your first session of tabletop simulator spiral
you fucking going all-in with _shit_
that was hilarious
<a:LUL3D:423275757415170100>
they're all different in quality
hard to say
i wouldn't say any of them are the best, they're all expressions of joy and mirth
so they're all great to me
lagush
_get her ass_
alright, you have it now cy
i think that's the last one i can do though
other people are going to have to toss money in if we want to get TTS for other people
otherwise, i think we have plenty of people
no prob bob
swag money
yeah, good luck
yes i am
anyway, i can't wait for texas holdem
i like this arrangement we have
where we just spontaneously go for game night whenever enough people are around who feel like it
i'm sure we'll try to run it at least once
yeah, we could totally make HSD themed monopoly
we could even do HSD themed _tokens_
i think you can design it in an outside program like photoshop or paint.net and then import the image as a texture
we can use that as the board
no we want HSD monpoly
i think we could do both honestly
like, one for HSD, one for homestuck
hm
i wonder if anyone has uploaded any scans of the artwork on those cards
if so, we could import them and replace the regular cards with them
i have a deck of those cards but it would be a real pain in the ass to scan all of them
bruhh, dead ass, bruhh, dead ass...
oh uh
i might not have that on me right now
i think it's archived in gen pins?
it's not
it's not terrible, it's just kind of poorly designed
10
i think it's 10 max per room
does it allow additional people as spectators??
well, we've had about 6-7 people each time we've done stuff
so i think we're at a good mix
no, that was superfight
which is like cards against humanity in that it deals with profane humor, but the object of the game is that you and another player "fight" each other with random nouns and properties, and you have to convince the whole table which one of you would win in a fight
for example, i got "canada + riding battle cats + wielding fire whips"
and then after me was i think canis, who had "the ghost of an aborted fetus + made of guacamole + " something else i can't remember
yes, thank you
canis won because he convinced that the aborted fetus would be able to shame the canadians through their moral failure
this was the funnier argument so he got the point
it's just whatever works in the moment
also pretty sure canadians have abortion rights
it was just a funny argument
if you get a tie in votes, then both people have to draw a random object and fight each other with that
the first time this happened, we got "a sharpshooter" versus "stephen hawking"
which made me laugh so hard i nearly threw up
yeah we'll definitely try to get it going sometime this weekend
whenever we feel like it really
it's a game that kind of requires you to use voice for though, you only have 30 seconds to make your case
it's practically a requirement of being here
booo
i will when i see the finished product
for now i sleep
ugh, christ
my head
no, bad dream
not even traditionally bad
just weird
no, i was being chased by a giant dinosaur monster or something
found a crevice to hide in, but the dinosaur turned into a very tall, slender woman to chase me and then fucking murdered me
i don't have a lot of dreams where i outright die, they're always disturbing
speaking of la-mlana i need to continue playing that now
is makin around or has he firmly disavowed watching me because i suck
i swear i'm getting better
that's more than enough time to make some progress
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
dumb argument
i'm starting up la mulana
i kind of want to fix this audio thing though
it's weird that people keep complaining it's so low
like, this shit is super loud for me
yeah tensei
you know what, i'm just going to get on and spend a bit of time troubleshooting
<https://www.twitch.tv/drewlinki>
<@!168980988477702145> <@!111477124384202752> either of you around to help out with this audio problem
<@!205026834205769748> are you awake
i guess not
USELESS
okay, i think i know how i can fix it
i just have to output the audio to more than one device
<:loss_jpg:354791933375152129> apparently being able to output audio to two devices simultaneously was phased out of more recent audio drivers for PC
this is ridiculous
apparently the audio option i could use to fix it on OBS isn't available on streamlabs either
forget it, people just gonna have to deal with low overall volume
carlarc, your whining has cost me almost an hour of my time
i hope you're happy
never heard of a pre-amp
let me look into this
oh, i don't know about this
even if it would help i don't know enough about audio tech to make it work properly
i will just suffer instead
CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT
that's what it sounded like to me too but i'm not knowledgeable enough for it either way
you're just going to have to suffer with low stream audio
whenever i get around to streaming la mulana 2 again
you can tell its shopped cuz of the pixels
i think it was like this with regular OBS too
sure, yeah
no
nah, razer doesn't have that
kind of weird, i agree
this is the first real complaint i would have about them is all
i'm not sure why literally everything is routing through my headphones
it's the default device on my sound settings but when i try to change that, i get no audio at all anymore
why must computers be so hard
anyway, cobra kai when
makin and carlarc were bitching about the audio being too low on my streams
they said they had everything turned up as high as they could go and they could barely hear me
which smacks of bullshit but i can't dispute it
fucking mobile users, of course
we did that just a few minutes ago cheeze, it was bad
compressed the audio
actually i never did listen to the clip
let me see what it sounds like on my end
what the FUCK
i don't know what you guys are talking about, this is loud as balls
i was expecting it to be hard to hear but now i have fucking hearing damage
oh, i can't even tell there's compression happening
i bet it's an audiophile thing
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
i can't expend anymore energy on this, it just feels like a waste of time
20 more minutes until cobra kai right
i'm more excited for this than i thought i would be
oh, i saw that actually makin
apparently she put vodka in its mouth
<:jerry:568521849714245665> did you actually just bait and switch your hot take
i think that if a celebrity of any cloth says they're contemplating suicide, the support given to them should begin and end at "go seek professional help and therapy"
it's not their audience's job to do that
also yes, don't torture animals, i think that should be fucking obvious
no, i'm kind of with you
i think there's a big difference between not being sympathetic towards assholes and not being sympathetic towards people who are generally fine and are just having a really hard time
being cold and uncaring about alinity is more understandable (even if it's not strictly ethical or moral) because like, she abused her cat
who does shit like that
but if it's someone who hasn't really done anything like that, it's less alright to be like "i don't give a shit, go away"
why does marble league have to take place at the same time as  community streams
this sucks
essentially
man, i miss game of champions
i'm going to have to reread that sometime
i can't wait for the rest of kobra kai
honestly
what did they mean by this
that would be the best position to be in
üë®‚Äçü¶≤
her detachment from earthly problems allows her greater insight into the future
hey putnam you ever heard that song by luke bryan that goes ONE MARGARITA TWO MARGARITA THREE MARGARITA _SHOT_
it's a fucking terrible song, as is most of luke bryan's music
oh, i thought you were just going to go to bed after fringe ended
i can play la mulana for a bit as long as you promise you won't get angery when i suck
it's too late
i'm booting the game up
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i just imagined makin in a black skintight suit with his face drawn on, underneath a heavy blanket with a nightcap on and everything
GET COZY
yes, i am
<https://www.twitch.tv/drewlinki>
you bastards
kplmjkom[
there's definite value to watching things in a group, even if it's for the first time
i was part of a movie night group when i was in college and we got together every tuesday to watch something together
i hadn't seen the majority of those films, but even the ones we agreed were unabashed shit were more enjoyable because we did it together
oh yeah, i also said we were watching the room again soon
it's been over a year unless i'm mistaken
spoons
man, we've got a lot of IRONS IN THE FIRE lately
makin's movie streams, the canwc reread, game night
it's been a solid week or two
i could also do that
i've never played it before, so that could be fun
oh my god
did the audience laugh or was it just miserable
<a:duane:640933212419522582>
what a solid fucking emote
AND I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
_HEAD _ _GAMES_
i'm late but misha is correct, potato sticks are culinarily distinct from french fries
that's just the name of the game
shoestring fries are just the smallest french fry
potato sticks are much smaller
like, they're smaller than pretzel sticks
very tiny, very dry
yeah, it's hard to demonstrate
you can find a can of potato sticks at any grocery store
look in the junk food section
also i'm struggling to think of what i want to do
i kind of want to play more card games, but i also want to play some retro stuff
the fuck
explain yourself
whoa, this music
i'll definitely have to look into this
congratulations misha, you get a gold star
everyone give misha a round of applause
he is our bestest boy
<a:Clapping:393565759718293514>
it is time for the borglar
9 million
that was great
thanks misha
you got that fucking right buddy
I KNOW!
what the fuck
i just searched for :nesquik: and got nothing
so next i searched for :bunny: and THIS is what came up
üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üëØ üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
hell, that entire movie could be turned into an emote
it would be hard to see what's happening but no more than <a:megababyvore:526984302907359232>
lmao
okay, in preparation for texas holdem at some point, i was looking at the wikipedia page to remind myself what the small and big blinds were
halfway down the page there's this webm
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Texas_Hold_%27em.webm
the construction of it is fucking surreal, take a look
is it NSFW at all
show it to me in private
it's fucking weird, isn't it
absolutely NO sound except for shuffling the cards, which i'm utterly convinced they added the sound effect later
reusing footage multiple times
that's some quality shit
hsd game night yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CfCa0HGvCE&t=79s
barkley can give it to anyone who asks, just not publicly
it's like right on the border of what i think would be acceptable so i'm preferring caution
booo
enough of this
that's death right there
apparently leffen posted more information about zero's first accusation
<https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sra9ee?new_post=true> apparently has NSFW information so no embed
oh this is the "showed hentai on the big screen" debacle
yeah i thought this would be more unambiguously serious
misha stop posting literal shit
well... i guess that's not wrong
playiong warhammer without us once again i see
that's a paddlin'
anyway i bought some vermouth, does anyone feel like playing cards
yah
whenever we have a suitable number of people interested
4-10
i'll just be playing sekiro until then
oh
i mean, i was mostly kidding
but also it wouldn't have been a good idea for me to get back into TTRPG right now
too much stuff happening, my schedule is basically non-existent
yeah, indeed
still waiting on vampire btw
shit's great
<:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
<:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
that's smart
GOLF IT?
whoops caps
all i saw from him was what the golf
<:waitwhat:316648744579760128>
wait, what
he's having a ralley at mt rushmore???
wait, what the FUCK? what is happening here
i am so fucking confused
that's wishful thinking for you
and also hedging your stock prices
holy shit
HOLY SHIT
his voice is DESTROYED
i wasn't expecting it to get that bad
i feel so bad for this guy
i think i've sounded like that at one point or another
after getting laryngitis
maybe they did it on purpose
get them clicks
man i want card gam
i'm not anywhere close to even tipsy but i'm feeling it
i'll wait a bit before pinging game night tho
what's sotol
i don't like tequila either, it's way too bitter
like, alcohol by itself is already bitter, but tequila is like a second, nastier layer of bitter on top
like you're drinking sand paper
lmao
i'm having vermouth for the first time tonight
it's almost too _sweet_ instead
which makes sense given that it's a dessert wine, but it's like i'm drinking fucking cherries
nah, i'm being trashy and drinking it straight from the bottle like a french wino
perhaps, but i don't think i have any gin around
good job
proud of you
either way, i'm gonna keep nursing this bottle and then we'll be playing texas holdem
if you want to join in make sure you have TTS and ask for the game night role
or else you will <:GanonDIE:553613459611189273>
+progress
tera irl
yeah i'd love to do texas holdem
give me a bit to get more drunker
it's a fascinating experience carl
at a certain point if you pay attention, you can literally feel your muscles loosen as stress goes away
i almost like just paying attention to the psychoactive effects more than the relaxation itself
multivac banned forever
it's always been cafe-lit
there was no read-shills
that's right, and don't you forget it
<:kek:230307022598438912>
what do you mean, that most discussion here is in that blocked off region
i mean the lower left you fuck
then shut up
<@&711911237700681789> i'm starting to get a teensy bit toasted, who's around for texas holdem
aye
IT'S JUST ONE GUY
and he's... playing fucking roblox?
nevermind, let's go watch this guy for a bit
what in the fuck is this
this is completely mystifying
this is the best thing for me to continue drinking vermouth to
yes you fucking dingus
fuck, he died
i already did
does anyone possibly know what this roblox game is
NO HE DIED
OOF
this is going in SPAT
do it moon
aight
Carlarc irl:
```Can't find my Roblox password so I can join this rando and wipe the floor with his ass: PANIK
Find my password: kalm
The email associated with the account is expired: PANIK```
we're not playing texas holdem yet
we're watching this person play roblox
OOF OOF
it was better before
```Today I got drunk on vermouth and we decided to play Texas Holdem in Table Top Simulator, but a user named gnostaoticAnArchanAUtahemist (I‚Äôm not kidding, that‚Äôs their name) was streaming Roblox in the video game voice channel. Instead of kicking them out we decided to watch them for a while. That is all.```
we\re watching this rando stream roblox
come join us

BRUH
f
YOU DIED
is anyone recording this
holy fucking shit gitaxian you're right
i'm losing my fucking mind over this
i legitimately can't believe this

HE'S FUCKING GONE
HE'S BACK
yeah, that didn't age too well now did it

yeah i' mdone with watching this guy
it was very fun but it's time to play
As is tradition, <#463922845513154581> is now open for business. Demonstrate your patriotism IN ALL CAPS, American or not. Happy Independence Day!
SPEAK UP ASSHOLE
HAHA BALD EAGLE GO SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
i'm done watching now, let's get going
what's happening
no
AMERICA
I'M SO PATRIOTIC IT'S COMING OUT OF MY ASS
admittedly this night of poker has not gone anywhere near as smoothly
it might be better to keep it to five card draw if we have a large number of people from now on
we ARE playing texas holdem
with 8 people it's kind of a mess
<@!125433170047795200> i need an adult

SOUNDS LIKE A FUCKWAD, WE DON'T APPROVE OF CANINGS IN THE LAND OF FREEDOM AND JUSTICE
THAT'S _COMMIE_ SHIT

THAT MAN LOOKS LIKE HE COULD HAND ME MY OWN ASS ON A PLATTER FOR DINNER
THE UR-CHAD
WHAT
THAT'S FUCKING COMMIE TALK
AND EFFETE COMMIE ACTION TOO
GOOD RIDDANCE
can't wait for dat kobra kai
are those fucking capybara
okay, i knew there's been some talk about them lately but what is this all actually about
i would dump fringe for cobra kai in a heartbeat
you're the odd one out it seems
i think most of us are completely engaged
if you aren't, that's completely alright
like, i am not engaged with fringe even though most people here seem to enjoy it
alright, then i don't see the problem
i mean, let's be clear, johnny is still a dick
yeah, the blond adult
but i'm interested to see where it goes, i want to know if he redeems himself somehow
i don't know what the objective reasoning is for why we _should_ care
i know that i personally care because like, things ended in karate kid 1 under a specific condition
where johnny got beaten at the karate championship even though he cheated
and he was like "YOU'RE ALRIGHT LARUSSO"
you'd think that means he understood what went wrong with his training
but obviously something is wrong, his life has been in shambles and he has no respect from anyone
he has not been redeemed, even though we saw that spark
so now i want to see if he can break through and become a better person
maybe being exposed to this young naive kid will finally bring the spark back
why does it sound boring
no he's not, he's the guy who lost the championship to larusso
then i guess it doesn't matter if anyone becomes a better person
your logic sounds kind of self-defeating
i mean, i'm not upset, i'm just exploring this avenue of thought
i like the premise and how it's been executed, and i'm interested that ifnar has found it really boring
he's not just Some Guy
he was specifically larusso's bully
larusso beat his ass and is ultra successful now, while johnny lives in squalor and filth and has arguably become even worse than he was
what <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
not every show has to have grandiose or extreme consequences
the focal point of a lot of dramas, and stories in general, is a very local and small scale
because you're expressing your thoughts in terms that suggest otherwise
```Oceans will not rise, cities will not fall because he becomes better.``` i don't understand why you would use this metaphor unless you were arguing it's not possible to care unless there are grand consequences to a story
daniel was also just some kid who won a karate tournament
it was still possible to care and enjoy karate kid
yes, i would agree
it adds a small element of absurdity to it
like, "these are two full grown adults rehashing dumb drama from the 80s"
but just because they're middle aged now doesn't mean that what happened stopped holding weight
well, that's kind of the point of the show, is getting to know these characters as they are now
and to see how they interact with each other
the old conflict is already established so we're not really wasting time on that aside from quick references
no it's not <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
at what point is miyagi a trickster
i guess i wouldn't really consider that a trick, but fair enough
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> god damn dude
i'm glad you managed to fix it
REEEEEEEEE
what have i missed, i was busy grilling
someone post the meme
i never miss that
that's not what i expected but that's good too
also we did hamborglars and brauts
god bless amorgilar
in commemoration of freedom for america and the hwole world day
very good
wednesday sounds kind of good
although i'll be available monday and tuesday evening too
when are most people available
gimme a hug, man
he's all beggin' you like "aw, phillip banks, KICK MY BUUUUTT"
`i like the young people`
which part do you want more information on
oh yeah, it's actually deadass simple
here's a video to set it up
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xq6ogadCaM&t>
once you get the online portion working, it's literally just a matter of making sure both or all people who are playing have the same randomized file in addition to oot 1.0
if you want i can set up a randomized file and help you make sure you've got it set up right
hell, i'd love to get a bunch of people in on it just to fuck around
we can keep the randomized rules simple and just have fun playing oot together
i literally just sent the video to figure out the online portion
it's in the video description <:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
sure thing
nights isn't able to finish our randomized run so if anyone else feels like starting one, i'm down
anyone else want in on this action
i'll help them through the process, though it's kind of easy so no worries regardless
idiot, fool, buffoon
do not check
gooey
actually you know what, we have a role to help with this
<@&711911237700681789> if any of you are interested in doing an oot randomizer where we're all playing multiplayer together, let me know and i'll help you set it up
it's fucking fun and not hard to make it work
BE THEEEEEEEEREEEEEEEEERE
all the files should be fine
just hurry up so we can for to play
exactamundo
what about you cheeze, you want in on this action
BORGLAR
damn, that sucks
what happened
sucks how, like not good specs?
i recently did some research to find a decent enough laptop for one of my friends
it's an acer or something, let me see if this is up your alley
https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Display-Graphics-Keyboard-A515-43-R19L/dp/B07RF1XD36/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Acer+Aspire&qid=1563665317&s=gateway&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=gamefeat-20&linkId=1c4e93edd4291d776bb9988e5ca48a9c&language=en_US
yeah, the 5 slim
it's pretty good for 350 bucks, the main problem is the RAM from what i remember
and of course, the memory is a bit low
unknown, but potentially a lot
if you have an external HDD it helps a lot with this one
fair enough, i'm sure you know more about buying laptops than i do
lmao
yeah, the one i linked is very cheap
i was buying the laptop as a replacement gift, i wanted it to be decently good but also not break the bank
she's been able to stream reliably on it and play most modern games on lower settings, so i'd say it wasn't bad
yeah, she was streaming ffXV or whatever it is
XIV
something
seemed to be handling it pretty well
i won't be streaming this
although tera might want to in chat
that could be fun
sounds like the laptop's good then, she was playing it on high settings and the stream was going smoothly
fuck yeah, good to know i made a solid choice
we have _traditions_ here, cookie
tera how's it coming along over there
ah
i thought that meant you would be playing with keyboard and i was like "okaaaay?"
i can take care of all the fine aiming stuff
it's gotten much better veli

woc you are a fucking wiener
if we were around in persopn right now, i am drunk enough that i would pile drive you into the ground
`anxiety is why we should legalize heroin`
this is the single greatest thing i've ever heard

you're thinking cocaine or something

spider, what in the fuck IS this shit
is this like a recording done by a local artist somewhere
because i actually have something similar, from when i was up in canada
there was a """""local band""""" that produced a number of albums and were available for purchase from some of the hole in the wall shops
i bought and listened to one and it was like having fever dreams
we've still got a bit of time before kobra kai so i could do that
is makin around or is he being a wiener as usual
you would rather read mediocre fanfiction than watch me be somehow even worse at playing a metroidvania
sad!
holy _shit_
some things never change
NOW WE SEE THE VIOLENCE INHERENT IN THE SYSTEM
i'll start la-mulana here in a bit tensei, i jsut needed a spot of breakfast
thanks crpal, you may go now
alright, starting la-mulana up
is a carb buck anything like a schrute buck
okay i'm live
twitch.tv/drewlinki or whatever
get in here and watch me be bad at video blames
that was rough
i am not a metroidvania person
yeah, what the fuck
hitler and the nazi party were both extremely well-known by like 1929
woc, knock this shit off
stop shitposting in here or the knives come out
i also think woc's participation is lacking here but i would never compare it to the invasion of poland
it's more like if my neighbor got incredibly drunk and irate and decided to sling his poo all over my house
i'll freeze the channel if this continues
i know
maybe i'm secretly already on woc's side
or maybe my real plan is to encourage woc to shitpost so much that i have no choice but to demod him
or maybe i'm already sick of the homestuck discord and i'm purposefully trashing it to make sure that no one wants to use it an--wait no that's hussie
we're still not really talking about
as each day passes i see less and less reason to keep it secret, especially with WP being the state it's currently in
but i still think keeping it under wraps for the present is more prudent
ifnar you spoke too soon
you fool, you charlatan
in retrospect it makes me feel kind of dirty too
like i had fallen into filth and reveled in it
trizza guy is an oddity
maybe he doesn't have an agenda at all
maybe this is just what he's like
oh god oh fuck
hype?
i think everyone's still watching fringe, the bastards
are you having a stroke carl
what in the fuck
oh, boy
i'm staying with my grandparents to help out for a couple days, and they love watching primetime tv and game shows and shit
i'm watching an episode of celebrity family feud and the gag is--i swear to god--is that all of the competitors are gay
and it's very clear that these people are professional actors and hamming it up as much as possible
yeah, i'm fucking astounded at what i'm witnessing
i don't know
if they're actually gay and this is how they act naturally then that's great
but i don't think that's what it is, it's a bunch of stereotypes
very frustrating
it's waiting to fight someone its own size
no whammies no whammies no whammies no whammies aaaaand _stop_
this is fucking mind numbing
how do people enjoy watching stuff like this
whammies fantasy
what's up
why was i pigeth
strange
as i said earlier, i'm staying with my grandparents for a bit to help them out for a couple days
my grandma is getting real old and feeble
so while my grandpa's at work i'll be making sure she's taken care of
she just got done telling me again a couple hours ago
thanks, i'll need it
my grandma has really advanced parkinson's and there was a serious medical complication earlier this year, so she's not doing too well
she can't really take care of herself anymore, can't even stand up on her own
it's a real charlie and the chocolate factory scenario
what's the occasion putnam
also be warned that beer tastes like absolute dog piss
it's not just boring, it's offensive
i still can't believe that people drink beer and enjoy it
i've had all sorts of beer that claims to be high quality, on the sweeter side, yada yada and all of it tastes like absolute crap
if you want an alcoholic drink that's actually dangerous for you, try boxed wine
stuff goes down like fruit juice but hits hard
who the fuck drinks canned orange juice
i get it out of plastic jugs like any american
god, i fucking forgot about andrew's choice of drink
that is a fucking horrifying mental image
it's not actually in a box, you fucking dingus, it's in a large plastic bag
the box is just for transportation
boxed wine is something you're supposed to bust out at large gatherings because it has a spigot
which blew my mind when i found that out
very carefully
i hope so
we had that once
i did not eat that food
yeah i'm good
i will just play ocarina of time
no cults or gods for me
fuck you okay
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
i would describe kanye west as many things, but "legit" isn't one of them
every single time i hear kanye's name in the news my first thought is "did someone forget to give him his bipolar medication"
oh fuck i need to get the room ready for tomorrow night
when you go upstairs to your room and your girlfriend decides to join you
unfortunately it seems like this version does a weird wobble/blur effect on the sex scenes, which means it's less repulsive and thus not suitable for viewing
does anyone else feel like setting up the room to watch tomorrow night
i can give detailed instructions
tera i said tomorrow you shit
also i did fuck up, i forgot to set the movie up before i left for my grandparent's place
i would prepare it myself but i legitimately don't think i could upload the video in time if i started right now
the internet speed here is like venezuela or something
it was just a single dollar
i needed it for change
also tera, are you taking up the mantle of responsibility to get this done
alright, do you need help getting it set up
also i don't know i figured we would do it in the mid to late evening
sorry euroclaps
them's the breaks
because i command it
6 pm pst is like, what
8 PM CST? 9 PM EST?
okay, that could work
it's habbeding
we're watching The Room tomorrow at 9 PM EST
it's time for our annualish viewing
should we ping the movie night role
<@!168980988477702145> do it slave
you're now honorary movie night steward
god damn it
hold on
i've enabled the ping roles perm for you
this is a test, don't fuck it up
it's only for this one thing
because it's setting up something i forgot to
to be completely honest, we need to start spreading the necessary skills and knowledge to the rest of the mod team in case something cataclysmic happens and all of our good stream managers/whoever else get fucked
good job tera
this will go in your portfolio
<@!168980988477702145> i literally do not, that's why i'm conscripting your help
you need to get tha file
if qweq has it get it from her instead
just get your hands on a .mkv or .mp4
it's been privated, so no
i found another version of it on youtube but it's all censored
yeah you dumb dumb
just reencode it with a dumb meme at the beginning for a few seconds and then make it a .mp4 or .mkv
i can even give you a meme from dero if you want
or better yet <@!146014279529791488> got any new short memes we can reencode our videos with
i'm still a fan of "i want that baby diego" but i'm sure you have some ditties or some shit
i always use windows movie maker, the fuck do you use for this
what <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
yeah i'm not sure about any of that qwq
i just add the intro meme, save to PC as an mp4, and then upload it to google drive
it's not completely efficient, but it's simple and reliable
<@!125433170047795200> i need an adult?
time for me to watch dragonzball p again
`defeating a sandwich... only makes it tastier. GUAUGUG`
VIRGINIA! HANGING OUT WITH LITTLE BOYS IN SPANDEX, I SEE!
jesus fucking christ, i can't believe dragonzball peepee is almost 8 years old
i thought it was more recent than that
you've been wound up all weekend
what's going on
but since you are neither i will simply say thank you for a job well done
i would almost agree to a group stream of the original DBZ if it was ocean dub
just for the oddity of it
i still feel like eventually we have to do DB, DB Kai
and then maybe super? i don't know
i love dragon ball
i swear up and down that the sense of power increase and scaling from the very beginning of DB all the way up to the frieza saga is fucking perfect
maybe a bit wobbly in DB at points
but you get a real sense of progress that feels good and sensible
like, goku isn't ever an overpowered world destroying freak
he goes from being a stronger than average boy and then slowly, slowly approaches super saiyan
it's GREAT
fair enoguh barkley, but what i mean is that the sense of what's happening is still apparent
like, if you follow each development from step to step, it's like
"yeah i can see how we reasonably got here"
and there's a concrete understanding of how and why you're there
i think something that toriyama really stops being able to do after the frieza saga is like, adequately displaying the actual consequence and scale of power involved
there's a lot of set dressing that involves that during the frieza saga, stuff like the sheer power of their charging up causing changes to the terrain and stuff
and then when the cell saga happens that just completely stops existing
<@!213413608732884994> yes btw
tien can't outclass krillin because he never went to namek
lord guru did the whole 'unlock your inner potential" thing
i bet if tien went and did that he would completely outclass krillin thoguh, i agree
<@!213413608732884994> i hunted down a copy
it's really dumb but useful for specific things
"Signed... your evil half."
shout out to when i watched all of the DBZA movies with tipsy
that was fun shit
yes actually
it definitely is
that was written in like the first six months i was doing spat
it's got the same problems the cell saga has but worse
no good sense of power scaling, bullshit asspulling developments
yeah, ironically the only good parts of the buu saga are mr. satan and fat buu being completely separate from the rest of the events
that's what i mean gnawms
the frieza saga did it right by having them be on a different planet and fucking destroy it
it gave real weight to what was going on and how powerful the were
in buu he... turns everyone into candy...
and nothing kersplodes
obviously this makes it worse
i don't consider wishing back everyone after a conflict is over to nullify the consequences, it's just "we won the battle so now the world is safe"
the stakes are inherent, if they lose then everyone is permanently dead
it's just fucking dumb with buu because the people of earth were like casually destroyed as a matter of course
with the namekians, it's honestly a pretty brutal genocide because they have this fucking god-like thing that can grant wishes
lmao
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
three years
mety i bet you a soggy hot dog that we will get nothing
why are we still part of this fandom
hell no
homestuck or at the least the shit surrounding homestuck suck WAY too hard for me to simp on it
<@!273994148825268224> yo, this shit about usenet communities is hitting hard
```I can comment in a journal thread or find their e-mail address and send them mail, and we might exchange a message or two about old times, and then the connection would fade away again. And that doesn't help, because the connection wasn't to just that person, it was to that thing that we were both part of, and I don't know where that thing is now. ```
i think that we're in a similar position, but not exactly by any means
because this community IS founded on a common piece of media that we all enjoy, but i think we all recognize the futility of that media and kind of innately understand that it's fading into obscurity
but the way that discord functions is extremely different from usenet, and maybe that's made it possible to foster friendships outside of just the thing we all happen to like in common
```Shared space is special. Shared space creates communities. Communities enable new relationships. Open communities build friends. ```
tm linked me to a piece of writing she thoguht i would like
https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/writing/community.html
it's very spat-like
yeah, go ahead
i might email this guy and let him know what i thoght
it seems like he really appreciates what it means to be part of an online community
conduct unbecoming was maxmikester getting fucking pissed off at makin for some reaso
i don't remember the original context unfortunately
if you can find max's ID number, then--okay
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
have you seen the room yet qweq
<a:GACHIFIRE:506116749566148609>
it's almost too late to start this randomizer run but imma do it anyway, fuck it
oot
i've done all the hardest randomizer settings except for tokensanity, which is just way too much to be bothered with
i've decided to cut back and do "weekly standard" settings and try to improve my speed a bit
i want to become more efficient at this and maybe participate in some races?
if i get good enough
it seems average amateur times are 4-5 hours
how about fuck no
wh
this feels like a fucking fanfic, lmao
i thought it would just stick to bare facts
the tapestry refers to the goku vs cell laser battle right
i didn't think mods made that
i see
is the room ready for tomorrow night
is the room ready or not <:ree:475542526791516170>
if it's in the processing step it's probably good
that's how it be
can't upload the raw files
you gotta reencode with something at the front
pathetic, do you even files bruh
i wasn't around for that
before my time
sure
no idea
too true <a:pensiveWobble:530000479401279490>
perfect
also the room is good to go for tomorrow
idiot
be ashamed of your mistakes
you 'll have to consult with carlarc on that
it might be complete nonsense
holy _shit_
i had completely forgotten that these exist
"fuck, i have some files to delete real quick" - tori probably
we used to have a lot of really shitty users around who gave us a bad reputation, which lingered even after they left
i would take tori back as a pseudo for altgen in a fucking heartbeat
she was great
<@!168980988477702145> there's a number of memes in that iceberg that are based on content dero has made
you're going to want to watch those
garbage ape is singularly great
you've been talking to woc too much
scp is a farce
neeeeeeeeeeext
i prefer blideo blames myself
it's probably much easier to passively create piss than it is to make any other liquid that can banish evil spirits
i hope you click on that video and it's literally just dolphin noises and swooshing water effects
endlessly
>dreamposting
THAT'S CRINGE BRO, DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER
if i know me, and i do, that is absolutely a yes
how aware of each others' culture are south american countries
and then the whole chat falls silent
wait a second

actually it's not just happy chemicals, it's your brain clearing out built up harmful chemicals in the brain over the day
it's like strictly required maintenance
biochemistry is deeply intertwined with my general studies
you can't clearly delineate between different subfields of biology sometimes because they're all pretty interrelated
in addition to becoming a specific type of biologist, you also need to learn a ton about other main disciplines just to make sure you're staying accurate
tm, we need to watch more breen flicks sometime
isn't that immoral?
makin
you know what we need to do now
pass thru\
we already watched it once and it was a fucking hit
yes
you fuck
anyway, we're doing the room tonight, but next on the Shitty Movie Monday list is pass thru
what's the idea interro
speak up, ye baldy
that was the same comment i made bP
there wasn't enough quality control in place for the collide reanimated
some of the parts are _really_ good
but there's a number of them that fucking suck too
who
that's true
but i would argue the specificity of that claim
there is clearly still a fandom, after all this place exists alongside everything else
but i do not think that there is much of a "larger fandom" anymore
like, people who are into homestuck and drift freely, participating in whatever they want/finding new stuff to engage in
the only homestuck fans left exist now in these little enclaves
whether the subreddit/here, twitter, mastodon, amino, etc
of interest to me is the absolute number of people who would identify as being in the homestuck fandom now
i don't believe it numbers more than 100,000
honestly  yeah, what barkley said
the make her pay reanimation was far better in quality like on a general basis?
there were little to no "low effort" contributions
and scaling probably does have something to do with that, insofar as you have a similar number of participants but for a much shorter animation
so you don't have to risk pulling more people in just to have them give you shit
bP, i don't doubt that there are new people who come into the fandom every so much
there are two main points of contention here: the size of the fandom now as compared to before, and the net rate of gain/loss of fandom members
the predominant arguments we hold to are that the fandom as it is now is orders of magnitude smaller than in the comic's heyday or even back in 2016, and with the way the properties are being handled, we're probably seeing an efflux of fandom members
ie a net loss of people as each year passes
this is what we mean when we say the fandom is dying
we don't say that derisively or anything like that, that's just the nature of what's happening now
i think we're counting homestuck 2 out prematurely
i believe it's basically dead as fuck or will be at one year in, but still
there is like a smidgen of a chance that it could be resuscitated
maybe... retconned?
dare i say?
what is it with people dreamposting today
unbelievable nonsense
<@!260222802471157760> that's kind of the inherent problem with anything that revolves around user participation
the average number of people in ANY community, not just fandom, that will involve themselves in creative endeavors and projects is about 1%
then there's about 10% who will bother to talk and discuss things
and then the rest just lurk
if you want more people participating and working, then you HAVE to increase the general size or else it won't happen
don't even bother wasting mental effort on that part krato
i once asked about their transparency and i got screamed at for it
i think we unironically have greater transparency than the official team
except for one very important serious thing
but we're not talking about that for now, and we're even kind of transparent in that we've delineated this thing we don't want to talk about yet
i mean, that could be it, yes
i think we're waiting until homestuck and/or the official team as it stands now are put in the ground
yes
the secret is out
> hussie doesn't have to do shit. he's a theorypilled marxist artist trying to do chaos magic with shit crayons and i love him for it
this hasn't been true since like 2014
that argument is fine bP but here's the problem: i don't believe he was being sincere about those motivations
it's one thing to say "the fandom should be driven and motivated to maintain itself and make all of the work they want to see happen"
it's another thing entirely to then make and endorse an official sequel and give it to a team of people who are variously unstable and vindictive
<@!153392726832840706> wait a second, what
please explain clearly what you're saying
unironically arguing that homestuck as a property could actually be treated as some kind of opensource work <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
we're well past that now
vast error is of arguable quality and basically no one gives a shit about it
>sell shirts
alright i'll see you on the other side of the lawsuit
i'll just start printing homestuck shirts in my grandma's house
bP, were you not here for the whole thing where kate accused our mod team and community as a whole of harboring child predators and "hosting a child porn ring"
our trust for the official team rests somewhere near bedrock
they can say "make your own homestuck!" all you want
you're working off of the assumption that the homestuck team would leave us or any fans they might not like alone in their endeavors
i'm saying that assumption is flawed because of who the official team is comprised of, and also that the underlying logic makes no fucking sense because homestuck is a commercial property
"just go make your own homestuck" is a batshit philosophy that has no underpinnings in reality
it sounds like what you're talking about is 'make your own fanventure"
which, yeah, of course
but a fanventure is not what we want
i mean, we can want it if it's good
but we want _homestuck_
we want something that's created by a person or a SMALL TEAM at most with a strong, unified vision of what to do and how to do it
we do not want a disorganized, sloppy, vitriolic group of people who harbor immense disdain for the fandom over various problems past and present, imagined or real
we don't want fan projects that peter out after six months
don't remind me nostalgic
i won't say that i regret giving kate or aysha scarves
as far as aysha is concerned, i still respect her and i'm glad i was able to show that
kate though, it's like
yeah, there was a shit ton of awful negative stuff that happened later
i gave that to her under the assumption that things would get better though
i still think that spirit or feeling is important, and i do not regret trying
it's just that what happened afterwards has kind of turned me off of being sympathetic towards the official team, ever again
bP, you know that the official team and hussie know who i am in real life right
if they wanted to and had the resources to devote to it, i could _actually_ get sued or persecuted somehow
we were genuinely worried about this when it came down to the accusations of child porn
i don't think you understand the severity of this
WHAT
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS
bP, i've been fucking emotionally distraught over this since the altercation happened
the negotiations with hussie came at a very inopportune in my life and didn't end very well
i'm just now in the last month or so able to get over it a bit
i'm in utter disbelief that we're having this conversation
what do you mean this is entertaining
i don't know about anyone else but makin and i are both still really upset about this shit
it was NOT fun or entertaining in the slightest, it was really agonizing
bP let's step away from the fact that WP in general is a wildly intolerant and abusive organization, and focus more on your assertion
which is that "anyone can make homestuck"
this is farcical, and i'll explain why very briefly
who writes a song of ice and fire
alright, good joke
no it's not gitaxian, you haven't even fucking heard the argument
shut up and let me finish
not just anyone can write a song of ice and fire, only grrm can write and publish those books
anyone CAN write a different story in that universe
but we already have a word for that, it's called a fanfic
fanfics are all well and good, there's plenty to like about them
but a fanfic usually can't exhibit the same style or finesse that the original which inspired it does
there are rare examples of fics that do that, but they're far and few between
yes, because that's how it literally works
no one can make homestuck like hussie made it
WP can do nothing to help already, what do you think this has been about
i don't know how you've been so thoroughly brainwashed that you think _anyone_ can make homestuck
you can call a fanfic homestuck but that doesn't actually count as homestuck
god damn i had to scroll down for forever in order to get past backlog
you people are talking up a storm today
there was one thing i wanted to address but i don't know if i have time
is bP already gone
no point then
ah, alright
you mentioned people reading SPAT and some of the content scaring them
specifically the stuff about the NSFW server?
i remember writing about that
this is actually a good example to bring up because it's something i discussed with hussie extensively
or rather, i explained it thoroughly
i'm not sure what he made it
anyway, in SPAT i made pretty sure to explain things clearly and carefully, especially when it comes to shit like what happened with the NSFW server
people getting the wrong message even so is kind of understandable, i tend to go on for a while and it's always possible for a misunderstanding to happen
but you know what you should do when you get concerned with something and want to know more?
you fucking _ask_
no one asked any of us or me about it
the next step in their minds was to accuse us of abusing minors
coincidentally, the entire debacle was kicked off by a malefactor specifically manufacturing false evidence to try and get us in trouble
but that didn't matter once we provided the proof
anyway, my point with bringing this up and trying to explain it: literally the only reason it might have occurred to any of the official team to look into SPAT or for them to make the accusations you're describing is because they wanted a reason to get us shut down
that's what it comes down to
our trust for the official team is at rock bottom because they've given us no reason to trust them, and every reason TO distrust them
once we made it absolutely clear what was going on and why the information they were operating on was bad, we asked for an official statement that made it clear we were in no way criminals and in no way had engaged in criminal behavior
we were also kind of hoping for a fucking _apology_ based on the part that kate and her ilk had played in escalating the matter
but instead she wrote this politically contrived, weaselworded bullshit statement that still issued a clear load of guilt on us
just thinking about it is raising my fucking blood pressure
i already did, when it was happening
therapist was pretty kind about it
very professional
thanks tensei, i was trying to stop gritting my teeth today
oh well, that makes me feel better bP
people not doing their due diligence and resorting to accusing us of serious felonies is okay because it's just people overreacting on twitter
this was also back near the server's creation
things were bumpier back then
the server only entered relative stability back in 2018 or so
yes nostalgic, he (perhaps rightly) proudly espouses his involvement in getting NSFW abolished
no
serious is now reserved for NSFW material that's ONLY about quality, substantive discussion
we get a lot of talk in there from younger people who are confused about their sexuality/gender
that sort of thing
<@!184545248930693120> i'm not sure if i've shown you this before or if you'll appreciate it, but have this classic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH8BsBPaQYY
i think the youngest i've seen was like, 9
oh fucking hell, cappter
that was a whole mess
i'm glad you like it
i was first shown that video back in 2010 by dero
or one of our other friends, i forget
here's something that i was always confused about with accusations against us
a lot of people who hated this community, or claimed to hate it, used past incidents where we had terrible users on here and then had to get rid of them
which sounds like it _could_ be reasonable from that description, but the problem is like
we eventually did get rid of them? there's never been a problem user that we just left running amok here
problem user as in someone who's actually detrimental to other people here or puts them in danger
you fucking dingus
anyway, my problem is that
you can't just point to the mere existence of problem users as an example of why a community sucks
let me distill the argument i guess
the case against us was that problem users existed _at any given time_, and thus our community was problematic
which essentially means that we were terrible because of the fact that these people exist at all
disregarding the fact that we get rid of them
which, if you think about it, is completely delusional
anyone who's moderated _anything,_ even a relatively small community of less than a couple hundred individuals, will understand that problem users arise as like from the ether
you literally cannot prevent people from coming in to try and fuck things up
sorry i keep disappearing, i'm currently in-house taking care of my dying grandmother
i could explain in full if you really want, it's just depressing
also to respond to the previous point, we actually look for potential mods/janitors on a more or less decent basis
we're not willing to take people on if they're going to verifiably suck though
makin, why would you do this
the last time revlar came back he got pissed off and left again

gnawms that stupid tweet reminds me, i was out driving earlier and took some pictures that helped to remind me why i like it out in the boonies
nah, the skyline is very wide open
it can be kind of empty at times but often enough there'll be really nice clouds floating by
my favorite clouds are the ones that look like gigantic floating mountains

at some point there was one that looked like a giant middle finger so that was fun too

the universe telling me to fuck off
i mean, i found it funny the first time i saw it, and specifically after dero told me the story of why and how she made it
alright
several years ago, dero was extremely high and wanted to make a spongebob meme
she found that image and was going to type out "NO DON'T TAKE MY CHEESEBURGER"
but she was too high and that's what came out
fuck, just telling it again made me laugh
don't call gnawms on bluffs, it never works

<@!168980988477702145> "HVSD was another server that was made by and contained a lot of people who had beef with the HSD."

cookie fulfills the same profile that a lot of people here do: he has strange opinions for weird and obtuse reasons
the difference is that cookie can't handle too much criticism of those opinions
i wasn't done tm
anyway, cookie couldn't handle criticism of those opinions and it led to him shutting down and asking people to stop, but not in ways that were clear or emphatic most of the time
the weirdness extended into the way they participated in general

i still feel that way here sometimes b3es
one of the better parts of this community, in my experience, is just how much stuff you get exposed to that you wouldn't otherwise have known about
it's a really widespread gathering of culture and experience
you know what else is this friday
wow, no one took that bait
whatever, dead hours, yada yada
depends on the shit they're saying
i think breath of the wild is a really nice change of pace for 3D zelda games but it has problems
lack of enemy diversity and dungeon design being the top two things that come to mind mechanically, and then a really dumb/understated story
things it does right include making exploration really fucking fun and good physics stuff
also really satisfying difficulty/challenge, at least in comparison to previous titles
yeah, okay, those are surface level complaints and/or taste driven
the music is specifically absent in the overworld on purpose, jontron made a similar argument and i've always found it kind of stupid
it would get extremely agonizing listening to the same, highly present theme for hours on end in a given territory
the first DLC was, what, path tracking, hard mode, master sword trials?
second DLC was champions ballad yeah
champions ballad had the hard challenge on the great plateau with instant kill lyre but also instant death, and then had a whole new dungeon
that was pretty good
yeah, was a disappointment
the motorcycle was literally just a horse
it couldn't do anything that horses couldn't already do
the way they could have justified it would be having it be spawnable anywhere
horses can't go in mountain regions or the desert
have it be able to do that
instant gratification
you cannot spawn it in the desert
believe me, that was the first thing i tried
it made absolute sense to and i was disappointed nonetheless
in a way i feel like that's an overgeneralization b3es, with regard to "they don't innovate/this isn't like the old thing"
i guess that precise complaint is stupid because it's inherently contradictory, but for me it's more a matter of "they don't do anything new" -> "hey this new thing actually fucking sucks because it wasn't done well"
that's how i feel about pokemon games anyway
i feel like every iterative mainline pokemon game doesn't address problems with the series that could easily be fixed/have been fixed in other series by now, and then introduces cheap gimmicks to keep fans interested
those gimmicks being shit like megaevolutions and gigantamax or whatever
i dont know how i feel about comparing double battles to megaevolutions, but i haven't played a new pokemon game since diamond and pearl so i'm not really qualified to say
yeah exactly tensei
but like
that doesn't prevent me from reading up on the stuff
i don't think i need to physically play the game to understand that megaevolutions are dumb bullshit
it's easy enough to look at how they work and say "that's horrible nonsense"
that's precisely what i mean by horrible nonsense
no, from literally everything i've seen of them, megaevolutions are like a big shiny toy dangled in front of the player's face
yeah, that's what i was going to bring up next
none of this matters because sword and shield sold like hotcakes despite suffering from an intense development controversy and also looking pretty mediocre in various respsects
wasn't sword and shield like the most successful generation in a long time

jesus christ, red and blue selling over 30 million units
i knew it was insanely popular but still
so sword and shield are the most successful games since diamond and pearl, and will likely surpass that by the time one year has gone by
which makes them the third most profitable pokemon generation so far
i should really just bite the bullet and see what the game is about
i do kind of want to stream it, for the novel experience of "i haven't played a pokemon game since fucking diamond and pearl"
hell, every mario game has the same basic premise but each of them tries to do _something_ unique or interesting with it
pokemon has been doing the same thing for 25 years
also it was really good
got a few comments like "why don't we stream bad movies more often"
i kind of agree, it's a different experience from watching kino shit all the time

sometimes i forget why i introduced you in spat by saying "you do nothing but read fanfic" but then you say shit like this and i remember
what in the actual fuck?
i saw it as a perfunctory subversion of that theme, where if you try to be a hero without a quirk you get fucking killed real fast
deku _didn't_ particularly deserve it, but by chance he managed to figure out all might's secret and so at that point he was automatically in a better position than most
then he proved himself, emotionally and physically
i'd say that's fine, because deku still wasn't perfect at that point and makes lots of mistakes
if makin is talking about making bnha a rational work then he needs to stop
bnha as its constructed is fine
for the most part
not necessarily
i don't think deku believes in himself even to wherever the story is now, but he definitely didn't fully trust himself even after he got the quirk
see the entrance exam, the first lesson, etc etc
the super confidence doesn't come out of nowhere dude, it's usually with provocation
see: being challenged directly by an enemy, or seeing one of his friends get hurt
that's just a shonen trope at that point
honestly deku is more complicated than most shonen protags i'm aware of _because_ of that
naruto and goku are both boneheaded ultra confident chads
i use the word "chads" sarcastically here
and then ken in fist of the north star was barely a character to begin with, but he didn't hesitate to blast a fucker at every turn
hm
it's been a while since i've seen any naruto so i don't really remember, i thoguht he started off as purely knuckleheaded in the story and the insecure backstory was backfill
GOKU SMASH
eh, i dunno woc
i think there's at least a BIT more subtlety to it than that
no, you shut it
the reason i say that is because the nine tailed fox was always a _threat_ to the guy too, where if he let it, the demon would consume him and resume its destruction blah blah blah
what
he was NOT a reincarnation, he was already born at the time the nine tailed fox was fucking shit up
he was a vessel that stored the monster
also naruto has no talent but he gains skill by being obstinate
that's kind of the point
what <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
you people are fucking delusional
naruto is bad but it's not THAT bad
naruto was NOT a reincarnation
he had ALREADY BEEN BORN
his parents got fucking killed while sealing the nine tailed fox IN HIM
<:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I AM TOO ANGERY TO READ
but sure
oh, THAT part
yeah fair enough, i forgot about that
no horny, sky
but yes
i need to get back to reading that story
someday
i was taking care of my grandma
as it is i still think your argument is a massive oversimplification and not even completely accurate
naruto _is_ unskilled, lazy stupid, and then he personally fixes that and becomes better through personal training
the other stuff is just like handicaps, cuz you know
that's how it be sometimes
what are you fucking talking about
he's constantly training throughout the series
that makes him the best because he didn't need to think about it, he just did it like a chad
you're just in denial
yeah, that's not very rational is it
ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM

tuesday and thursday doesn't have streams attached to them
fucking hell, really
okay, nevermind
we do have too many streams
is that what you call it
yeah, i've brought this up before
makin basically monopolizing stream time
i was reassured that this wasn't an issue
well _fix it_ or the knives come out
tensei that would only apply if everyone on the server had an equal chance of advertising and distributing their streams
but Big Makin already has an in with the streaming industry so all the smaller streams get crowded out naturally
this is why we need regulations to prevent monopolies from taking over

alright, i'll have to put this experiment off until next week then
shut up, peon
sein, what can i say? i miss lsd
:walterSipping:
that's kind of why i'm performing an experiment mines
i don't trust the descriptions of other people
i'll be exhaustively writing down what it is i see
carlarc, i am a _proper_ scientist
all of the descriptions i've seen from other people _on this subject_ have been unverified wieners
this is an expedition into fringe science, except it's not as cool and also has real life consequences
keep wishing sein
anyway, i'm gonna have to wait until next week regardless
i need a solid block of time where i'll be able to engage in this bullshit uninterrupted
and i'm not going to allow myself to drive anywhere while doing it, because that would be imbecilic
i just realized this explanation doesn't make sense out of context: my grandmother lives an hour away from where i'm staying
i also can't perform this experiment when i'm taking care of her because i actually need to be able to assist her
you wanna get some for me?
that's what i thought bittpch
also i've already done LSD, seriously

https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/swedens-covid-experiment-is-now-a-certified-failure
```Not only have thousands more people died than in neighboring countries that imposed lockdowns, but Sweden‚Äôs economy has fared little better.  ‚ÄúThey literally gained nothing,‚Äù said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a self-inflicted wound, and they have no economic gains.‚Äù```
weren't we talking about something like this
pretty sure tensei was saying something to the effect of "government officials are talking about whether it's better to try and stay open and weather the virus in order to save the economy" because the fallout from a worsening economy might be worse
no, the netherlands are fine because they actually had some kind of response to covid-19
sweden is getting absolutely fucked though, they have a 7.4% death rate
while america, as moronic as it is, only has about a 3-4%
```More than three months later, the coronavirus is blamed for 5,420 deaths in Sweden, according to the World Health Organization. That might not sound especially horrendous compared with the more than 129,000 Americans who have died. But Sweden is a country of only 10 million people. Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more deaths than the United States, 12 times more than Norway, seven times more than Finland and six times more than Denmark.```
i mean, makin is right in that _ideally_ you shouldn't have noticeable loading times, it would objectively be preferable not to experience waits between major portions of a game
but i agree that he's being pett
wait, what
what's going on, where is cobra kai
RIOT
RIOT
RIOT
FINISH FRINGE SO WE CAN WATCH COBRA KAI REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

stream one show at a time
no it's not, people just fucking leave when the show they want to watch is over

SEE THE VIOLENCE INHERENT IN THE SYSTEM
i didn't like how makin was monopolizing stream times by doing it every wednesday AND friday AND saturday AND sunday
no you fucking dingus
i don't want to cancel streams
i feel like the way we've been going about it is unsustainable
i fear the day when google gets wise and introduces some method specifically to try and stop streams like this from happening
imagine being makin and refusing to stream cobra kai because misha is taking up _free spots_ during the week

doomp eet
you know, i've thought about buying dogecoin again while it's real low just for fun
i still think it's a funny coin
but i didn't bother
no, if you buy it with the idea of getting rich you're a moron, that's just how it is
but once the price is back down, i think what i'll do is slowly buy it until i have a million coins, which is what i wanted to do in the first place
dogeillionaire is stupid but entertains me greatly
and if the price ever happens to go back up, then i'll probably make some money
either way i win
yeah i'm probably going to forget about dogecoin in like five days and this will never happen again
also i feel dirty now that i've clicked onto tiktok.com
we need a moratorium
current price is 4 cents, which is higher than what i sold for
oh, lmao
nevermind then, it's still totally worthless
i sold at 2 cents some years ago and had about 40,000 coins i think?
made a tidy 800 bucks
good shit
considering i bought in for 10 bucks
but that was back when the coin was worth like 0.00001 cents or something
yeah, i actually bought a number of those
i have 2 copper coins, 1 silver, and one gold-plated
i really liked dogecoin back when the community was burgeoning
i don't think they're worth anything other than bullion values
i mean, i've kept them in mint condition so maybe as a funny collector's item?

i can't help you i'm afraid, but you've reminded me of a different book that I'VE been trying to remember the name of
i read it when i was in like elementary or middle school
might have been a sequel
but it involves this weird fantasy world connected to the real world by a cave
there's a festival where the protags are doing some kind of fireshow
then through the cave there's a building that's made from a lot of wishes made on this magic ring
at the end of the story the owners of the ring are convinced to get rid of it because it's causing a shit ton of problems, but it causes everything that was wished for to be reversed, including a lot of additions to the mansion
i've never been able to find this book, i'm sure at least partially because i can't describe it for shit
what was that, /r/showerthoguhts?
gosh woc, i don't know, but i have a feeling you're going to tell me
i hate you
i believe a group of scientists managed to figure out and make a technical proof of converting text files into DNA and back again
actually tera, there are large swathes of DNA that don't actually code for anything meaningful
we do that all the time already
i bet you could convert the code for KOTOR2 into DNA and then insert it somewhere in the genome where it wouldn't cause any harm
there are enormous portions of our DNA where there is nothing useful or important
there is no practical application, it just is
i'd say you could use it as a particularly convoluted form of data storage and archival, but DNA isn't a lossless format by any means
woc, come on
stop being fucking gross
i'll get used to the feeling of my foot up your ass
i need to start being more strict about moderating shit and carrying out my threats

the biggest problem with ambitious flashes is indeed the time it takes to make them, they're really impressive for archival reads but if it takes too long to make then it puts people at risk of losing interest
this is less of a problem if you work like a demon or have a team who should all be able to handle the additional work, but o has done this a lot over the years
he's gotta get back, back, back to the past
when he didn't make as many flashes that were high amounts of work
gotta keep the pace UP
i fucking hope
it's good to have ambition but work within your means
i was sabout to post that one, yeah
the gas/air that expels the bullet and follows it makes a lot of the noise, but it gets caught in those feathers
maybe when things settle down a bit
it's weird over here right now
is there any feeling as mildly obnoxious as getting food stuck in your teeth and not having something to get it out with
wizard ass lookin motherfucker
i don't think we have any plans to play, but there's no reason we can't do so if people are around and interested
<@&711911237700681789> should we play something in TTS tonight? anything's on the table, y/n
snake oil or superfight would be great
five card draw for poker is probably the most complicated version of poker we should go for if we have more than like 4 or 5 people
with 8 people, texas holdem was a disaster
or not a disaster, but just kind of a nightmare
oh yeah, i forgot about that
also no, fuck uno
uno is the worst card game
it takes fucking forever and is infuriating
i'm vetoing the SHIT out of uno
next question
fuck is mau mau
i was probably too drunk to remember
i'm down to learn a new card game that isn't poker adjacent, we could always spread our repertoire
although i have to say, superfight sounds fucking great tonight
or something like that
we could do snake oil, i wouldn't mind
i've played it before and it really is the same thing, not sure how funny it would be by comparison cuz it's been a while since i played
we've got some people interested so i'm sure we'll do something
not sure when but we'll make time
it's superfight but with fake products
you have to convince your other players which would be more useful/worth buying
i would agree that it'd be better in person, but i don't think that doing it only really diminishes the fun
superfight was easily the hardest i've laughed in months
even accounting for nesquik
shut the fuck up magicposter
you deserve prison
i JUST fucking explained this to you
or do you mean the actual, historical idea of snake oil
scroll UP you fuck
<:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
1 for five card draw, 2 for superfight, 3 for snake oil, 4 if you don't care which one we play and let me make an executive decision when we start
_lightsaber_
every time we use linkybot, there's just a little more lore that gets created
how is that pro slavery
<@!168980988477702145> fordite dese nuts
why do you people suck so bad
<@!152254501376491520> do you also need it still
what
WHAT DO YOU WANT
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
ugh, i guess we can go now
yeah, let's do it
i need a break from sekiro
i'm near the end of a NG demon bell + no kuro's charm run
it was very annoying at first but the challenge is exactly what i needed to make the game interesting again
i think next i'll do a no upgrading attack/physical attributes run
fucking sigh
what's your steam name george
weird
there's a fucking multiplayer mod??
not as far as i'm aware
i'll have to check that out george
anyway, i'm currently deciding whether i should get you two TTS
i really don't think i should
but i appreciate the people here
too much
let's just get in voice chat
<@&711911237700681789> assemble
we're doing snake oil, or superfight if we can't find that
<@!213413608732884994> we're playing cards if you wanted to join
also how did you do the thing where you only deal to people who are at the table
we've started
will you finish in time for game night or is it not happening
fuck you say?
<a:Clapping:393565759718293514>
it's still in place
<@!125433170047795200> stop fucking posting random bullshit
i WILL kill
this is the last time
still gets me good mang
actually it was at least vaguely on topic
you literally posted your thing without ANY kind of prelude, therefore you suck
<@!168980988477702145> it's true though, it was a response to woc posting bullshit and getting arned
no you fucking dumbasses
negadrew posted it because woc was shitposting with piss
out of nowhere
it was a reactionary shitpost
there's a difference
GAWD
yeah i agree
SHUT THE FUCK UP I'M PLAYING SEKIRO REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
i'm trying to beat the headless at the bottom of the lake in fountainhead palace
i mean, it adds some measure of depth to the game
the only problem with terror is that you do nothing but chip damage unless you have a specific, finite resource
if it weren't for that, i wouldn't care about the instagibbing
dark souls and sekiro are like cousins
they have very different flavors
that's what happens in sekiro yeah
dark souls 2 is the only one wehre your health gets consistently worse every time you die
in dark souls 1 you just lose your humanity, and in dark souls 3 you don't lose anything except an optional powerup
you also lose experience
which is really frustrating when you're just a bit away fro man upgrade
i feel like unseen aid hits way less than 30%
that doesn't really matter
a good game gives you lots of movement options to work with so people can experiment and find what works for them
sekiro has a metric fuck ton of movement options, i just think the community is kind of... bad?
not like toxic, but just not there
dark souls has a community that's fucking rabid and obsessed with finding every little detail they can, and it persists after the release of each game
sekiro had good fervor going on for a few months but like died away in less than half a year
there are a lot of wiki pages that are just missing details
that feels kind of bad because sekiro is easily the best all-around miyazaki game
george sekiro is like one of two games i've bothered to 100%
i'm only a couple bosses away from finishing a NG run with bell demon AND no kuro's charm
i know this game forward and backwards
you are weak
oh yeah
thanks for the reminder
oh shit dingus
IT'S TIME FOR THE DICK WAGGING CONTEST




i love miyazaki
imagine not having... a life
what is this, warframe posting
PROUD...
also felt fast-paced
anyone know of any really good pokemon mods for like, gen 3 or 4
i need something to play while i have shitty internet
it'd be nice to experience the newer pokemon sprites and shit i guess
if no one has any good suggestions i have nameless firered mod, which has all the sprites up to like... VI? i think?
lemme check it out
wait, featuring all content through gen 7?
do they mean countries as well???
oh no, it's just the pokemon
holy shit

this one looks good at a first glance
oh, this is still very early in production
<:loss_jpg:354791933375152129> fair enough
i guess i'll just keep playing with nameless firered mod
weird to think i stumbled on one of the better ones by accident
what the hell https://www.pokemoncoders.com/pokemon-ultra-shiny-gold-sigma/
this seems pretty ambitious
i say "ambitious" but most of the stuff it's set out to do, it has
you can't stop me
i shouold probably bite the bullet and actually play pokemon clover sometime
if i'm going to be getting into this romhack bullshit
that's a quality response
put it in the album
TRY AGAIN, NERD
we disable it for normies when it gets used too much, but chat is slow right now so i don't foresee any problems
speaking of slow chat, i wanna run some stats and see something
brb
hm
i will keep this stat to myself
especially because it's still pretty recent since the change i'm thinking about, so data right now isn't too meaningful
they're pretty neat actually
oh man, i remember that
it fucking suuuuuuuuuuucked
yeah, i thought it would make me feel even more energetic but instead i just overdosed on caffeine and felt really fucking sick
or maybe i would have just died
also, the stat i was hiding is me comparing the average number of messages sent in homestuck games as compared to when it was still hiveswap and pesterchum as separate channels
interestingly, the new channel appears to have half the average number of messages sent per day
but it's also only been a thing for like a week, so it would be very premature to state that with certainty already
that too
it was alright
a couple standout episodes, a bunch of meh/okay ones, and a couple offensively bad ones
the very ending is... confused
pesterquest is completely done
has been for months
yeah
the kanaya one isn't quite outright bad, it's just kind of boring and completely inconsequential
kanaya plays more of a part/is more interesting in the episodes she appears in that aren't her own
i found feferi and eridan to be the worst ones by far
and it sucked because they were both in the same set, so i think their bad qualities compounded in my mind and i really fucking panned that release
aradia and jade were the best ones, with special commendations for the dave episode
person who wrote the eridan episode
there's bad blood between him and this community
yeah, it was fairly nonsensical and not done anywhere near as well as the vriska episode
and even that was kind of offputting for some people
you really haven't been keeping up, huh
it's not outright transitioning, it's like retconning elements of their personality and identity
oh christ on a cracker
i mean, it's more than hinted at in the eridan episode, he's got a fucking closet or mannequins with feminine clothing on them
and he does the "I WAS JUST EXPERIMENTING" thing or something, i don't know
i couldn't stomach playing the episode more than once, i don't remember
in the sollux episode it's straight up not mentioned at all
alright, good to know i'm not pulling shit out of my ass
it's accelerationist bullshit
no, accelerationist as in anarcho blah blah political stuff
something about increasing and elevating tensions so that more people feel like getting involved in the protests about capitalism and stuff like police brutality
which, to be clear, those protests are good
but the people who espouse stuff like "phase 2" are kind of nutty
mind you, don't take what i'm saying at face value, you should probably look this shit up
fair enough
i don't know, i think it's important to be at least marginally aware of these things
we've moved on from such earthly problems, sky
now all we do here is spam D--> linky and wait for wales to release the newest chapter of wtc
it's an economic thing smeevs
i'm going to sacrifice some of my laziness and look this up so i can properly inform you
uh
i actually can't find any information on this <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i may just not be searching for the right thing but this appears to be so fringe that it's not being written about hardly at all
so what is the actual idea of phase 2
and how on earth did it transform into an actual political movement despite literally being conceptualized as a joke
yeah of course
w-what
oh, i thought that was in response to "what was the thing you cared about"
it kind of shocked my brain into some sort of nervous response
is the term "Post-Fandom" actually getting used even if in a remote capacity
this is probably the first time i've heard it
not really
well, alright, i'm being harsh
it's vaguely interesting
oh god, not more of this shit
sky, you have a way with words but i hate this idea you're presenting:  ```Incorporeal ideas of copyright and canon, that they somehow "control" the formless ideas we can create, and that any further ideas need be hoarded and kept under lock and key: that your ideas exist to feed you.```
this is not the first time i've heard the "canon is meaningless" spiel even within the last week
it's not meaningless, and presenting it as some kind of contrivance of capitalism is really intellectually dishonest
death of the author has nothing to do with canonicity
i don't give a shit about hussie's opinions but i still consider some parts of homestuck to be more relevant than others
i know, i was shorthanding the idea
don't worry about it samurai, we just enjoy argumentative discussions sometimes
no one is actually upset here, i think
how homestuck FUCKING SUCKS now and all of the writers are hack frauds
honestly b3es, i say that as a joke but i've seen a lot of stuff i wasn't familiar with in the last several months and it's like
"wow, hussie basically ripped this idea off"
there's a lot to homestuck that's genuinely innovative and unique but
LOST alone has some ideas that it takes from and i can't go back to unseeing it
oh god, sky
this is even worse than when i read it the first time
this is just outrageously self-indulgent and the message it's trying to impart makes me kind of angry
no, the thing in homestuck 2
it makes me angry because it's almost like a strawman
calliope here is obviously meant to be wrong in the sense that she's a self-aggrandizing figure
and the way she's talking is very sanctimonious
there's a contradiction here:
```The really dedicated ones will completely copy the source material: write a complete novel-sized story of their own, or draw a comic of how they wish things had gone. Creating new splinters, weaving stories into new universes, telling new stories.```
if you're creating new stories and shit, then you're not copying the source material
creating new stuff isn't a problem, obviously
the problems are 1) copying old stuff and 2) making new stuff poorly
vast error is intrinsically tied to homestuck through its visual style and the nature of some of its content
that part's fine
what's not fine is that vast error is a boring slog that is going nowhere fast
i say that having read it twice
i've seen vast error touted as some kind of triumph of fandom-originated storytelling
but no one gives a shit about vast error outside of people who have already been fans of it for a while
it has absolutely no appeal outside of the homestuck fandom, or even the bubble of fans it already has
as a self-driven thing that's fine, but i don't like it when people pretend that it's a bastion of fanfiction
yeah, that is also true
like, let's not mince words here, canwc is an ultra niche thing that 99% of people in the homestuck fandom as a whole don't give two shits about
but that's kind of what i'm getting at here, is that you have to call a spade a spade
i don't think i even understand the premise that's being debated here
you're asking whether vast error is able to be conceptually distinguished by anything except capitalism?????
what the hell does money have to do with it
homestuck isn't distinguished from other works of media because of money, there are conceptual ideas and authorial factors that all determine what a work is and how it's created
what exactly homestuck "is" can be defined in a number of ways, but it's still concretely possible to point out ways that a piece of media "isn't" homestuck
vast error "isn't" homestuck for various reasons
it might be homestuck _adjacent_ but it's not homestuck
hiveswap and pesterquest are also not homestuck even though they're closer than something like vast error, if you're looking at it on a spectrum basis
this is due to a variety of complex factors
what the fuck do you mean "create your own homestuck"
you mean just write your own story and call it homestuck
why on earth would you do that
you stupid or somethin'
no it's not sky, that's ridiculous
canwc doesn't pretend that it's homestuck proper in the slightest, that's kind of the entire point of the work
no, it's not
i mean, that might be part of the issue, but there are a lot of ideas about like creativity and sharing of concepts
there's a Line somewhere that if you cross it, you're no longer creating a distinct work with its own properties and are instead ripping something off
that line rests somewhere between copying a work wholesale and making fanfic
as with art in general, no one defines it i guess
it's a conversation that people have to have
look, we've discussed this many, many times
we've agreed more or less as a general consensus type deal that you can argue about art in an objective sense ONLY if you establish certain axiomatic principles before you start the conversation
the problem is that people like to argue on different axioms of quality
bringing a concrete example back into this discussion, whoever wants to is free to describe vast error as "their own homestuck"
conversely, i'm free to call that arrogant nonsense
yeah, i shouldn't have phrased it like that
i don't know what austin thinks of their own work, i'm more describing the way this topic has been danced around by other people i've talked to
i really, really hate the whole "just make your own homestuck!" notion that's been passing around lately
it's incredibly disingenuous and pointless
i certainly fucking don't, it's content creators wanting to have their cake and eat it too
i don't like sounding like a broken record/negative nancy, mind you, i'm not usually this vociferous in my opinions
i'm just extremely jaded with how homestuck 2 has been going, both in universe and out of it
what, even recently?
i thought that fan sequels like act 8 and whatever else were basically done with
jesus
are they any good
i think that's the focal point of the conversation b3es
is "why does it matter if it's official/what does official even mean"
i find those questions really tiresome because it should be obvious why a work being "official" matters, and muddying the waters as to what that even is doesn't really help anyone
the creators of homestuck 2 and pesterquest, apparently
this is what i meant by muddying the waters, really
homestuck 2 and pesterquest are both bolstered enormously by support from the person who created the work they both spawned from, which gives them a platform above basically every other effort in the fandom itself
but the message of homestuck 2 and pesterquest, among other things, is "it doesn't matter that we're official!" which is like
pointlessly contradictory and also just makes everyone fucking confused
i'm not even sure that i disagree with the idea? i think it's just that the way it's been conveyed so far is really garbled sophistry that makes no sense
there's definitely _an argument_ to be made for rendering the idea of canonicity null
but homestuck 2 at least has not made the case for that idea well in the slightest
the team is or at least was getting paid for making the work through a patreon that was being driven entirely by name brand recognition
bah
i'm really harping on this long past its due, but i'm just massively irritated with how things have gone
homestuck 2 was extremely exciting when it was first announced and then six months later it's basically been a wet fart and doesn't even look like it's going to make it to a one year anniversary
it's hard not to be dispirited
"bad on purpose" needs to be distinguished with "bad on purpose done well" and "bad on purpose done badly"
a work that's made expressly to be irritating or unsatisfying is still bad even if it succeeded in its goal of being bad
a work that somehow provides meaning and entertainment through its awful quality is more like a so bad it's good thing
i'm just musing at this point
need to stop griping about hs2 at _some_ point
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
shut the fuck up misha, god
i hate you for making me laugh at that
WHA-WHO IS THIS?
huh, it's been a while since i've done a pushup
let me see if i can still do it
yeah that was actually pretty easy
i got up to 5
i can't do a pullup though, too heavy
every time i remember that it makes me want to lose weight even more
that's the idea
wait is this basically a direct or what
then i don't care
oh shit we can actually stream marble league today since makin isn't hogging the room

modern art is fine, postmodern though? destruction
you clap those ch--i have to stop myself this is too much
i'm more than fine with complaining about kate as far as homestuck is concerned but leave the rest of her life out of it you fucking mooks
the next time i see anyone talking about real parts of her life OUTSIDE of homestuck is getting canned, immediately
what on earth is happening with this nightmare of a shitfuck property
remember when i wrote a spat entry where i called the official team acutely dysfunctional
this is the kind of shit i was talking about
yes <:HOLYFUCKINGSHIT:402489641112174604>
two kinds of users
tera, remind me in a couple hours
i'm still keeping an eye on grandma for now
c ouple means two you fuck

no i'm serious tera
we need a reckoni--no we don't
the emperor is due to start his march any time now
but nh
i'm kind of astonished how quickly this all fell apart, both in the long and short term
it's been just over half a year since they started and it already looks like it's basically going to be left unfinished
and then within a month of going on hiatus, the team seems to be imploding
what the fuck is _happening_ to them
do they need help
i don't mean that rhetorically, i'm genuinely asking
i was asking it as a way to start a dialogue about what kinds of things might help get their shit under control
i guess we can't really contribute anything in that regard because they're notoriously close-lipped about the reasoning for literally any decision they make
and i'm not about to extend another olive branch to figure out how to mend things, look where that got us last time
i asked for that directly at some point cello and, as i've said before, i basically got screamed at for being entitled/asking things i didn't need to know
so that's off the table
it's like they _want_ to spurn the fandom as much as humanly possible
none of us (as far as i know) have an inside look at what's truly happening behind the scenes, but to all appearances it is not good
i'm reminded of the thread where someone was like "i just want to say thanks to this community for existing and being great

even if some of you bitch about homestuck 2 a lot because you wanna hate on it"
it's like "dude what the fuck, we bitch about it because it's not going well, not because we hate the work and want to see it fail"
there's some kind of cognitive disconnect where people think that because we complain about homestuck 2, we're indiscriminate whiners who are just looking for something to piss on for fun
we WANT this shit to succeed, we're all here because we had a connection with homestuck or one of its adjacent properties and liked it so much that we wanted to talk with other people about it
it's because it's a very visible aspect of who they are cookie, so it becomes a lightning rod for discussion and it distracts from the more important issue of "what are these people like, what are their personalities"
the epilogues are contentious, let's be real
i enjoyed them a lot but they have obvious problems and a lot of people hate them outright
i mean
gitaxian i don't think that literally every attempt to continue or expand on homestuck is doomed to controversy
it's just that the stuff we've gotten so far has been middling at best
the only thing that's been put out aside from the epilogues that i was truly taken with was, i kid you not, the aradia route in pesterquest
it did _everything_ that i expected from a homestuck adjacent piece of media
hs2 is bad for many reasons sky
development trouble is part of that to be sure
but the writing is really just... not good, in almost every chapter
the only thing about homestuck 2 that i've been consistently happy with is the art, which usually has something i outright enjoy in basically every update
the way exposition works is very clunky and transparently geared towards making less work for the artist (prattles), which is insane because that's making it harder for the best part of the comic to shine through
for a visual medium like this you MUST be able to convey what's happening through visuals as well aswriting
pip arguing that flashes were never in the cards was like a really big fucking nail in the coffin
<:GONE:696509069233487972>
i was going to say, i thought i remembered some old drama getting rehashed in trace's case
oh no, it's not JUST the underage fics, it's in conjunction with tavros
past controversies don't matter until you fuck up in the present, and then it's all fair game
andrew, take it easy
yeah i know, i'm just telling you to cool it a bit
okay, this is turning into unwarranted mudslinging
makin always places first at the humility contest, because he's the only person arrogant enough to show up
you're wrong, tavros tried to do the benevolent thing by confronting a raging megalomaniac who wanted to be responsible for making everything important happen, including the destruction of two entire universes
in what kind of story is tavros the bad guy here
what the fuck <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
oh god, that was years ago
not now, later
we'll use them to decompress
don't read spat, the guy who wrote it sucks
i think we've harped on the topic more than enough to be honest
the overall point is that it was extremely harrowing
i could go on for a while about how exhausting and disappointing it was, but really what's the point
it's over with and basically everyone lost
i t just makes me fucking tired woc
i've described this before but dealing with all that was enough to make me question why i bother with any of this
and that's particularly infuriating because i already know the answer to that question
i really enjoy being here and talking with people about homestuck and other things
but those negotiations were enough to make me think that wasn't worth it, if even just for a few minutes
like, i spend countless hours of my time managing and protecting a community against slander and helping its members out unconditionally, and that's the kind of thanks i get? man, really glad i wrote 700 pages of bullshit just to get dumped on
and makin got it even worse than i did
i'm fucking amazed that he's still as energetic and motivated to engage with homestuck as much as he does now
he's like a one-man dynamo
anyway, the moral of the story is that i appreciate everyone and even though official negotiations made me want to cut off my left arm, you're all worth it
is there a cheat code where i can become unfathomably rich
i should try to get into writing smut for commissions, i've heard those people make bank too
apparently the threshold is quite high though, lots of competition
so maybe i'll just die instead

<@!168980988477702145> makin found two toblerones, i asked him to keep one for me
i gave the toblerone away because i felt bad for taking one from the local populace
also my wish wouldn't have been valid cuz i didn't get the bar myself
<@!168980988477702145> When the channel solely consisted of
other than those comments, i sanction this post for release

already enjoying pokemon clover

i don't know how, but this is making me giggle like a dumbass
it's so simplistic

no pretense, just fucking "DICKS"
this is appropriate because i picked to be a girl and named her Vagania
THE POKELAB THEME IS THE ALWAYS SUNNY THEME <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i need to play more funnee games on stream
not pokemon clover because pokemon fucking sucks as a stream experience
though i already appreciate the details

unfortunately i don't think i'm going to stream clover regardless, i want to power through and move on to the other one
ultra shiny dick butt sigma aldrich cock wiener gold edition
fair enough gnawms
maybe i'll save it for later then?
it might be nice to play through a more regular pokemon romhack and then do this one
i could always stream little parts of clover and grind in between like you said
i'd like pointers about where it's good to stop if i do that
"team reddit" hoo boy
i'll try and stream it when i get back on like monday
make sure you're there at least so i don't get lost
i just got hit by an enormous wave of nostalgia
cyndaquil will always be my favorite starter
didn't i already stream that at some point
i do love me some monkeyball though
i've 100%ed it a few times
i've heard fun things about marble madness
it's mods and friends
misha meant in the iceberg doc specifically
you and misha have both been mentioned plenty of times
also stop dick wagging about spat references
if you want me to anonymize you i'm fine with that
wieners i guess
dammit
misha are you talking about fucking barnyard
why can't i hold all these limes
this is true of all media
trust me i'm an expert
ehhhh kind of
not really
she just happens to get stuck with gravemind in 2 and her super special aspect is derived from her relationship with chief
that's perfectly fine in my opinion
i should clarify, i don't mean that she becomes super special because she is around chief
i mean that she is special in the sense that she is close to chief
which is a whole different thing
cortana being based on halsey started before 3 i'm pretty sure
in terms of it being in the game, sure
im not even sure that's right though
apparently halsey's only vaguely alluded to in 3
she's first concretely mentioned in ODST and i don't even think they specify that cortana came from her at that point
she was definitively introduced in reach though
er
The Fall of Reach, the book prequel to halo CE
and i distinctly remember cortana being grafted from her neural network being mentioned in that book
so the poison had set in long before even halo 2 came out
cortana and master chief being The Chosen Ones solidly started in the games with halo 4
the whole reclaimer thing comes to bear in that one instead of being a generalized thing that refers to humans
and then of course the didact, yada yada
343 really fucked things up
what is it with dreamposting tonight
GIVE ME YOUR TEETH
everyone knows that changing any aspect of your online presence demands death
what's your new name b3es
frumple with the joke of the day
HIGHEST QUALITY GUARANTEE 3d_molier
what tangled webs we weave
what is your plan of action
lmao
funny you should mention that, we used to have one when makin was in charge of the server
most of us were indifferent to it, but a few people really didn't like it
that is part of what the old patreon went towards funding
oh, you're suggesting something totally separated from running the server
so basically a big pot for everyone to put money into to be distributed as deemed appropriate by the collective
now there's an idea
TOO LATE
WE'RE DOING IT
yeah i know, i just wanted to expand on the idea
i claim no responsibility for dream me's machinations
shitler's finger in the bottom left corner sells it for me
actually, i think it was because i needed 4 quarters, and i'm pretty sure i wanted quarters to get gum out of one of those gumball machines
there were a number of people who did that, and i always kind of frowned upon it
seems in especially poor taste given how small WP is
i don't like how they conduct themselves but i wouldn't speed blast pesterquest and refund it out of spite
how long ago was that? a year and a half?
yes, it was a very misguided use of developmental resources
A lot of people call me shitlee
ur mum
suck me long and hard thru my jorts
<:GONE:696509069233487972>
makin would unironically whip people into action, yeah
he's only been in charge of kicking people's asses into gear on, what, like a thousand different projects?
that's my new profile picture
gears of war is really fun
i recently marathoned the entire series and i had a blast
there were only a few parts that i was frustrated with
yeah
i was very impressed
he's as much of a character as baird or cole in my opinion
he's just there as Another Member of the Squad
also i agree, the ending was... weird
i think i was physically annoyed with ||another kaiju that wrecks shit like nobody's business||
me too
i went on a huge wiki spree after beating gears 5
i saw a comment from some random reviewer dipshit who said "it seems that gears of war is finally casting off its stoic shell in favor of embracing a rich storytelling landscape and fictional world"
i agree with the latter part, in that gears of war has a lot of room to expand its story and i think gears 5 did it _marvelously_ with the terrain exploration and little bits and pieces you can pick up
but that reviewer is a moron, gears has never really been stoic
every single character is depressed and scared shitless that they're going to get merced at every turn
literally why did they bother with that
adam?
also misha, gears has really, really weird lore in that a lot of it is basically alternate history earth
there are a shit ton of things that are just... identical to earth culture, but not with earth countries or land masses
they have fucking christianity
and also greek mythology up to at least the concept of centaurs
nope, sera is just alternate earth
b3es the lore specifically describes ancient human society as an endless war
called the Apocalypse Era
the kryll were destroyed along with their breeding grounds in the upper hollow after the lightmass initiative
b3es, if you want to take the absence of absolute wording as evidence that they could have come from a different planet _in contradiction to every other piece of circumstantial evidence in the series_ then sure, you could have a point
but all things being considered, you're wrong
and i'm saying that you can point to the lack of that source as a piece of evidence in your favor, but it's going against the grain of literally every other piece of lore in the story
it's basically a crack theory based on nothing
when i say that sera is alternate history earth, i mean that it has elements of our real world that are literally just copy pasted and then mashed in with everything that ISN'T from our earth
like i said, they literally have christianity and names like "centaur," which implies an ancient greek scoeity
but the geographical layout of the world isn't the same, and obviously their history becomes distinct at some point because the game has to happen
also they don't speak english, it's called "tyran"
i mean they don't _call_ it english, whatever
tyran is the official language of the nation tyrus, which is where most of the series takes place
you never learn those details until like the most recent game because it never mattered before
in gears 5 they actually bothered to introduce background elements to the story that shed light on like political happenings and details of what happened in the pendulum wars
RED
SAND
the mark of any good game is that you feel like you want to explore it outside the confines of the map
i don't generally enjoy borderlands but that principle was true of the first game for me too
gears 5 evoked that feeling really hard
there's a point in the red desert where you can look out over a cliff edge and see this enormous expanse of sand and lightning going off
and i was just hit by this intense urge to see if i could go there
as soon as i feel that, i know it's a game i'll remember fondly for a very long time
let me guess: <:fatHusky:295293991438516228> ?
oh that's nice
the logo toss is alright
oh these kids --oh
haha, nice
link me
yeah, i have literally never seen that idea anywhere in the official material
what no
oh boy i can't wait to hear this
LOL
don't you just love frivolous lawsuits
also, not to undercut this story, but i was thinking of something
ever since we learned that ||the gorasni had a far more developed space program with hardsuits and everything, i've wanted it to be revealed that they sent a group of colonists off to either of the moons or even risea and that a major plot point in a future game would be contacting them with an improved space program or something. there's even a wiki page about it https://gearsofwar.fandom.com/wiki/Expedition_to_the_Moons_of_Sera||
depends on how they do it, i can easily imagine it going awry if handled poorly
"gears jumped the shark" is already a perilously accurate assessment in some ways
/r/comedyheaven
fucking "Weird * Last night"
the locusts are not an old species
it's lore spoilers for games 4/5
if you don't mind being spoiled i'll explain
aight, dig this
you remember the sire in gears 2
they show back up in 5, and so does niles
||niles created a secret research base under the ice lakes in the approach to mount kadar, and in it he developed a better AI replication of himself and brought along some test subjects||
||as a reminder, niles was a pendulum era mad scientist who experimented on kids who had developed rustlung||
||one of those kids didn't show symptoms of sickness from the disease, and actually seemed perfectly healthy/stronger than normal||
||niles took some cell samples and tried to mix it with other kids who had rustlung but the results of those experiments mostly led to the creation of the sire||
hold on, i'm refreshing my memory with the wiki so i don't accidentally say something wrong
okay i had it mostly right but good refresher
||that one kid who had natural resistance to rustlung/imulsion turned out to be myrrah, and mixing her DNA with the sire led to the creation of the first berserker, also known as the matriarch||
||the matriarch produced the first generation of drones and berserkers, and that's where the locust came from. myrrah became the queen of the locust by syncing her mind with the matriarch and enhancing her psychic connection with the species||
so yeah, the locust are only about 50 years old
at the time of emergence day
yeah, that's complete nonsense
isn't obscure video game lore great
the main games are not, but all of this background shit is
baird got _really_ drunk one night and had a nightmare about it
this is what inspired him to create robots
man, playing through that pokemon romhack
i'm reminded of game of champions lore where all pokemon are basically dangerous as fuck wild animals, and they had "The Youngster Initiative" to explain why there are so many children out catching bug pokemon
so in the game of champions universe most of those kids just get fucking killed in the woods by various pokemon
when is that author releasing the rest of the synopsis god dammit
<:annoyedcallie:315592174903230464>
milk carton, yeah
no
not at all
what part of "i'm taking care of my sick and dying grandma" do you not understand
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
why is everyone posting skwisgarr swisgelf all of a sudden
i work out at the library
i think that people have the opportunity to learn and grow continuously throughout their lives, that doesn't just stop when you turn 18-20, or even 25
i think it's more a matter of people choosing not to learn anymore
my point was more that "dumb kid" can refer to variously any portion of someone's life
it's just that at some point it becomes "dumb adult" and is no longer as acceptable
i'm not sure where that cut off is though, because i hear contrasting messages about when someone is considered fully an adult
18 years old is obviously farcical
people stop "developing" at the age of 25, but that's still pretty young
so what, like 30? 40?
40 seems pretty past the cut off
but shit, my mom is 52 and still doesn't know how to act like an adult sometimes
i think i'm mixing up my concepts here
that's kind of what i mean tarty, is that a lot of adults i've talked to will say stuff like "nah i didn't have my shit together in my 20s, it was only once i got in my THIRTIES that i started feeling like i knew what was going on"
i think everyone is full of shit
"marathoning accident"
oh jesus
i don't think joking about this is in very good taste
maybe we should move on
lmao
my brain could not process what nostalgic meant for a second
and then i looked at the word and finally i heard it in my mind: "tiddy"
made me laugh

one of the kids on my bus brought a plastic bottle full of everclear and was passing it around so other people could get drunk
this was _on the way_ to school in the morning
like, emotionally? physically?
we had a couple of teenage pregnancies, one of those girls was my friend
then i found out who got her pregnant and we weren't friends anymore after that
no, it was 35 year old man
living in the country is a very wild and depressing experience at times
she was 17

you should draw more memes of this channel
stroke our massive egos
oh shit, does she take commissions
it depends on how expensive the commission is andrew
i'm more than willing to toss some money to starving artists anytime
but not if it'll break the bank no what i'm sayin
in seriousness, i really like the uh
community art sort of experience
i don't know how to describe it
it's very entertaining and exciting when art springs out of a conversation that people have
tipsy making art is one of my favorite things for this reason
how detailed would you make that drawing if i actually paid you $413
nice
i actually saw food fight, i don't know if we'd make it through
actually i can't remember how the movie goes, but i remember being spectacularly bored
there is, yeah
115 with no mistakes
no, it's not quite chiti misha
it's definitely in that camp but while roboda was like a winnebago, kamen rider is more like one of those tents you prop up with collapsing rods
everyone can appreciate a winnebago, you have to enjoy camping a LOT in order to tolerate a small tent
thanks doc
i mean, i can vaguely see why someone would connect the two
it's a stretch, but pointy green
god damn, yeah
it's almost the size of a chihuahua

<:awakened:638148929648590886>
you should probably get that looked at
i almost forgot that there's a sick comet out for the next week or so
it's going to be at its strongest at dawn right now and dawn tomorrow
but it'll be visible in the night sky (at increasingly earlier times) up until like the 22nd or so
apparently the 20th will be the best view due to waning moon
fuck, i need to see this
haley's comet isn't gonna be back for another like 50 years
https://wwmt.com/news/local/newly-identified-comet-neowise-is-a-visible-glow-in-the-night-sky
fuck
the treeline here is too high and i can't see it
might get a better view tomorrow morning near the city, but light pollution is a fuck
what are you talking about
that'll change, i just looked it up and the comet is currently approaching earth until the 22nd or so
it's closest to the sun right now, so it's as bright as it's going to get, but it'll continue being fairly visible until the 22nd and then it'll fade out after that
as it gets closer to the earth, it'll rise into the night sky earlier and earlier so we don't have to wake up at the buttcrack of dawn to see it
```Starting on July 11, the comet will also appear about an hour and a half after sunset very low on the north-northwest horizon, but only briefly. In the coming days, the height the comet as it appears from the horizon will slowly increase, meaning it might be easier to spot later this week.

Writers for Space.com said the best evening viewing will occur about 80 minutes after sunset in the July 14 to July 19 time frame. By July 19, the comet will appear about 20 degrees from the horizon and will be in the northwest horizon.```
yeah this is the first comet visible with the naked eye for like 25 years
i think i tried at one point and had a decently okay time and then just never continued
oh no that was dragon age origins
<@!154008479802195968> no, i don't think there is a point to the idea you just described
fandom is not inherently toxic, but it can attract people who have the potential to be toxic
the urge to get together with other people in order to discuss something is not in itself a toxic thing, nor is that a toxic activity
the manner in which you talk about it might be toxic, or a group might be infiltrated by people with toxic personalities
i'm just trying ot say it's an important distinction
anyway, kate's rhetoric is kind of dumb and certainly self-serving as usual

yeah, before we cleared the bots it was easily like some thousands more
you guys have no idea how many bots we ended up banning last year, theyj ust kept coming at us
uh
okay

why does that matter
you _swindled_ me
yeah, let's get more characters that are socially adept but can't accomplish basic tasks to save their lives
i take it back, let's not have any stories like that
it's an unofficial mod hangout
i don't exactly know how that works but it's always been the case
oh boy it's time to check how much activity the fellow travelers discord has
let's see here
for the entire month of june, it seems that the fellow travelers discord had... 2000 messages
1,600 messages cheeze, so about 80%
for comparison, here's us:
actually it's about 60,0000
which isn't great
that's only about 8.5% of the total messages sent for the given time period
but the fact that we have that much homestuck discussion when we have all of... this
i say as i wave my hands vaguely
is fucking amazing
ironically, the homestuck channels have been just as active if not more so during this hiatus
near every day we have over 1,000 messages in <#530564260720410644>, where before during updates it could get down as low as a hundred or so
what
yes
why does it seem low crpal
homestuck 2 has been a complete failure, hiveswap act 2 is nowhere to be seen, and as far as anyone can tell, the official team is imploding
how far we've come...
now we talk about a shit ton of stuff that isn't homestuck, like this https://i.redd.it/ybfii8mdxea51.png
holy shit, did you know that the fellow travelers discord has been around longer than us by like 3 months
it's like a tiny war hammer
oh okay
alright armchair medieval weapons experts
are people really that upset about "based" and "cringe"
basic meme phrases have been a thing for many years, those are just the most common ones right now
oh god spiral that reminds me
i heard an advertisement on local radio where an old guy said, i shit you not, "does looking at your old gutters ever make you feel... 'cringey'"
makin you never gave me the episode links
i'll have to catch up later
still can't watch today anyway so not a big deal
that's ominous
okay fine
you will perish in the coming fires
i'm massively enjoying the troll face derivatives but yeah, cease

what no <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
tensei do you not remember the meme
maybe that was before you got modded
okay i was on the way home one day in a part of kansas without good cell reception
this was back in like 2017 mind, so back when things were still super active and contentious
we were having a huge argument in mod chat because i was actively railing against makin and woc and someone else for baiting users, and woc was like "but it's hilarious"
so in cold, unironic fury, i sent "Do you enjoy pissing other people off for fun?"
but then we hit a rough patch in my reception so it just kept sending that message over and over and over again, like a few dozen times
yeah, i kind of miss when i was more idealistic about taking care of people
like, don't get me wrong, i still care about it a lot and i don't actively ignore anything if it's actually a problem
but i just know now that you can't adjudicate everything like it's the most important thing in the world
and quick and nimble

he was asked to explain it during an interview and he was like "nah see it's actually not the same rhythm at all" and then proceeded to beatbox the exact same rhythm to under pressure
yeah that's fine
people sample tracks all the time
at first he wasn't crediting them though, which was a huge no no
anyhow, now that i'm back at my other place, it's time to resume sekiro and probably beat this run
when doves cry
we keep talking about dos2 but never actually end up doing it <:reeeee:248154233352749056>
what an awful missed opportunity
one of us could have had that
think about it
good ol' 12p
i'm pretty sure discord would shit its pants if anyone tried to make a fully functioning version of pokemon red using discord api
i approve of this, but not here
do it somewhere else
which episode woc
i've been playing sekiro
let me check it out
this feels like something that would be great if it weren't directly tied to star wars
shut up
shut up
shut up
shut up
shut up
anyway, this is horrible and yet another step in the wrong direction for star TREK and it's going to do really well because no one gives a shit anymore
i'd pay to see what george lucas does with star trek's corpse
"everyone has laser swords now"
"because i said so"
that's even better

tl;dr wales is having a difficult time right now
i think it's perfectly fine to continuously bitch about someone who does bad shit and doesn't stop
although i agree that it should at least _try_ to be framed around unique angles each time
sometimes you just gotta complain about how shitty something is though
i agree, this is really dumb sophistry
which is impressive because sophistry is by its nature already done
i saw a suggestion for them to change their name to "redtails," which i'm not totally sure would be good or bad but was the best idea i saw
what happened with that anyway

The dawn of the fourth millennium has arrived.
but why
What are you, crazy?!
WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY BARKLEY?
WHERE'S MY _FUCKING MONEY?_
i'm amazed how many times i've seen the room and yet i ALWAYS find something new in that movie i didn't notice before
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
death
look man i'm sure the answer is out there somewhere, you just gotta look
ask and ye shall receive-a
you're my favorite customer
HALO... THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
oh yeah, we need to watch some neil breen movies
WHO AM I
WHAT AM I
downloading halo 3 now
i cannot contain my excitement
what do i look like, a moron
holy fucking shit
i did not expect to hear this
```creating the robot Geoff Peterson for The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson``` i didn't fucking know this
what even happened
it says he "died suddenly" but doesn't offer an explanation
maybe needs an autopsy i guess
no it doesn't, i just checked
what??
mines the words "brain aneurysm" does not appear anywhere in this article
<:jerry:568521849714245665>

oh my fucking god
they updated the article in the time between when i clicked on it and you clicked on it
that's impressive timing
yeah don't do that here
what the actual fuck is going on
do not fucking play with money here
this is actually bannable
2FORT
your time is up and your time is _up_ and your time is _UP_
my sister's child was a child of death
we were starving
my name is jeaj val jeaj
nostalgia is there, yes, but the nostalgia exists because the game was fucking amazing
i easily played over 1000 hours on halo 3 when it came out
no way to tell really
xbox didn't keep track of time played
but hell, i played that game constantly in high school
holy SHIT https://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/Default.aspx?player=Drew+Linky
i can't believe this
i haven't seen this in like 8 years
yeah i was more a fan of the campaign than online
most of my matchmaking was private games with friends
shit like jenga
where do you see how many hours you played total
thanks hb
a fuck ton of it now, but none of the newer stuff is very good
but then you get into newer novels and it's a nightmare of a shitfuck universe
who cares, they're bad
i hope we can assemble a crew to play halo 3 4 player coop
i am fucking bananas for that shit
probably not, i don't imagine halo is a very fun game to watch someone else play
well, if we can get a solid cabal of people who will definitely play all the way through, then sure

both
i need to kill my younger self... before i get into college
dumbass
thanks carl
this gives me life
thank you
why not
it's because god hates you
that sounds like star wars fallen order
ceterum autem censeo carthaginem esse delendam
listening to waterloo like
probably because people take one look at that thumbnail and say "i don't feel like watching snuff today"
hercules
i rank the beatles purely based on their characters in the yellow submarine, in which case ringo is the correct answer because he's a chad who loves and respects people
jeremy hillary boob phd saved the day, and he wouldn't have been able to without ringo's compassion
truly a movie for the ages
because drugs are gerat
linkybot dabbing on all of us once again
tons of people?? the beatles are only in contention for the most famous musical group in fucking history
i prefer the beach boys if i'm being perfectly honest but i like the beatles plenty too
especially like sgt peppers and onwards
i have an album from a local band up in new brunswick
i doubt it's on youtube or anything, let me go find the album so i can share the titles with you
well, it seems in the last two years i lost the album
i just wanted to read off the track list, but it was the typical "local deranged ""artist""" type of deal
apparently recorded the music in one take in his basement with no professional recording equipment, average track name is "i fucked mario in the ass"
stuff like that
you deserve death for your crimes
delightful
nat we're watching kamen rider please hold all questions until after the tour is finished
burget king
yurkey will never not make me laugh
<:harold:423256024984846356>
is this a free game
wait, so who is this homemademeal guy talking to yandev
what is the drama
happy borth kitteh
lmao, wait, okay
so this project is completely unaffiliated with yansim
but yandev reached out to make this guy stop, because the unrelated game was similar in _concept_ and making yandev look bad

i'm fucking astounded
LOL
yandev how the fuck are you so terrible
this is all very funny, but at the same time it's kind of fucked up
how is yandev this unapologetically awful
sometimes people impress me with just how shitty they are
expunged is right, yes
that's the worst thing i've ever seen
but in a casual way
wait, there are jumpscares for this game
nevermind i'm not playing it
hate jump scares with a passion
terrible nonsense
wait, is that it
that's the entire jumpscare
that barely counts, i'll play
where can i find this
wtf this ain't free
I'VE BEEN DUPED
could have sworn someone said it was
either way i'll put it on the wishlist
VERY SCARY VIDEO DO NOT CLICK ||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnrwM7vFn_U||
holy shit look at this fine fellow right here
it's habbeding
that's mercy you uncultured swine
who on earth would design their office like this
fuck, i don't know why but that got me too

holy fucking christ, why am i losing my shit this hard over this
i think it's because of the way the template looks and also because i can hear it in gnawms' voice
we're masochists, gnawms
it's just what we do
yeah dude, the little green men were great
heinlein certainly has a way with words
i'm losing my fucking mind
i just got doing a bell demon + no kuro's charm run of sekiro, now i'm doing no beads or attack upgrades
i didn't think it could get harder than the no charm + demon bell but this is getting absurd
FINALLYT
o'rin is easily my most hated boss i think
<:RikerHowHigh:426046714601013260> this is a great emote
failure
i don't use prosthetic tools for the most part
the only thing i've really gotten used to is shuriken (alongside the occasional dash attack paired with it) and then using the axe to break wooden shields
i've occasionally used sabimaru against the snake eyes bosses but i find it too unreliable for that
oh yeah, i also use malcontent against demon of hatred, but i've largely stopped doing that
i can never hit them enough to actually get them poisoned
bah
either way, not using prosthetic tools is the chad way of doing it
oh man, i'm looking forward to sword saint with these restrictions
that fight is going to suck dick
COMPUTER
TURN OFF THAT NOISE
i've been deliberately trying to make it so that i don't run away from attacks if i can avoid it, and just deflect properly
it feels like i'm relearning how to play this game entirely
also becoming more completely familiar with certain attack patterns
i need to find a mod that allows me to practice against bosses and enemies until i have them down perfect, and then i want to stream myself doing a speedrun
yeah, that's lame and cheesy to the utmost degree
GUYS HOLY SHIT
LOOK WHAT I FOUND
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
"i don't want to remember the context for this" \*immediately looks it up*\
congration, you played yourself
twitter continues to be a cesspool
more at 11
what language thing
also i was mostly joking, i didn't mean to disparage use of the prosthetic tools
i DO think that stunlocking with fireworks is actually a bit too cheesy, but the game is legit insanely hard as it is already
if people need firecrackers to get through certain fights then so be it, y'know
full props to them
as you said though, the swordplay is the best part
the genichiro fights are my favorite part because of that, it's always a treat to fight him on top of the citadel
just constant trading of blows, and the music fits it perfectly
lmao, that's ridiculous
whose bright idea was it
eternal has a few other things like that which kind of befuddle me
such as having to reset the ripatorium whenever you've fought in it 10 times
you have to "restart" the hub world, which makes no fucking sense
i have to imagine that these are just design oversights that they'll patch in later updates
wait really
i hadn't checked the rest of the ship so i didn't notice
yes
let me check real fast, damn
okay, suddenly less sure about what you're saying
i'm not sure this applies to me
yeah thankfully i did not suffer the glitch you're describing
shut the fuck up antiskub
you deserve death
i'm a bit late cuz sekiro but i swear no cleanup
i use desktop shortcuts literally never
yeah, sometimes we play
we're on a bit of a dry period right now though
i have a server i rent space on so that if we ever feel like playing i can get it set up quickly
thanks spider
i can always count on you to have really fucking weird images
just hit it with something sharp
usually enough to kill it in one hit
<:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
if ubuntu is 5e then what's 4 and advanced
<:ree:475542526791516170>
what the fuck is little feat
alright, let's see what this is about
this is alright
and no, i'm hoping to see it tonight but i think that the treeline around here is making it too difficult
the best angle we're going to get is like 20 degrees above the horizon, if i'm not mistaken
might have to go take a night drive or something, find a flat spot to look out
yeah this song is aight
fuck, yeah we have a thunderstorm tonight
that ain't happening
it's leaving the sun but approaching the earth until the 22nd
then it'll be leaving both and it'll fade from view pretty quickly
so we have about another week
it'll still be visible after that but it'll be much harder to see
i need to find time to view it, it's just hard around here
that'd be cool
optimal viewing time will be about an hour after sunset i think, but look for articles about it to be sure
are you in the northern hemisphere
then look to the northwest or north northwest
good luck in your mission
oh, i didn't realize you have like legit phototaking experience
i'm excited to see what you get
what is this, homestuck 2
sunday monday happy days
tuesday wednesday happy days
thursday friday happy days
saturday, what a day
ROCKIN' ALL WEEK WITH YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
if you say so linkybot
i refuse
fucking hell
the local string of infections begins
it's easier on the eyes, mostly
alright enough of that, out of here
oh, this is about some form of voting that i can't recall
i don't think it's ranked choice
someone help me out here
fuck, what was it
this was when makin was first trying to decide what to stream next
and he had that fucking asinine website
i have grand designs, woc
too grand for your puny human intellect to understand
thanks tori
we can always count on you
have there been any newer star trek shitposts
i feel like someone has gotta be making these
thank you youtube user "A"
god damn it
i've been forgetting to take stats for the last couple nights
i hate when the backlog piles up
i asked if we could do that and woc was like "that's work, i'm not doing it"
we need to go deeper
how can we beam these stats numbers directly into my brain each night
what are you in-SAIYA ?
fuck me, whatever
can someone just put me out of my misery already
not gonna lie, while these tf2 videos are really impressive on a technical basis, i don't find them entertaining at all
i'm not even really sure why they don't make me laugh, i loved kitty0706's videos back in the day and it's basically the same shit but more extreme
maybe that's the problem, these new ones feel a bit overexaggerated
which is a fucking ridiculous complaint given the subject matter, but still
oxymoron?
"Enjoying the painting, eh? I always had you pinned more as a mouthbreather."
therefore you are
speaking of neowise i'm going to go check outside real fast
nop
hopefully tomorrow
i'm going to shit blood if i don't get to see this eventually
Wig!
didn't you know the lower half of the galaxy has literally nothing to look at
there isn't even any other galaxies in that part of the universe, only the northern hemisphere matters
i like "wig" in the same way that i like "dab," which is to say in a purely passive capacity
if it weren't for other people referencing it i wouldn't ever say or think about it
as it is it's a fine thing to just stumble upon from other people
did brazil have a lot of gold in it somehow
fascinating
i had no idea
i need to read up more on world history
where is this going, tera
its been quiet all evening and then all of a sudden you people are shitposting down my neck
what HAPPENED
FUCKING BRAZILPOSTERS
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
the BABY fucking DIES
i always forget about Goold Old P.U.
it's a high quality YTP
<:UNRELENTINGTRASH:456927328929316865>
i sympathize, my brain does this sometimes
<@!146014279529791488> the BABY fucking DIES
fucking terrible
<@!125433170047795200> you ever get the urge to just get in a fist fight and beat the absolute snot out of some punks
<:BabyRagev100:242465675640045568>
what the fuck
<@!168980988477702145> what are you talking about
<@!146014279529791488> you disgust me
<@!257144766901256192> you disgust me too
<@!125433170047795200> CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRABBO
oh yeah
that's gonna have to wait a few days
i'm heading back to my grandparents', all of my HTML files are on my desktop and i don't bring that with me because it'd be a pain in the ass
remind me on friday
but no guarantees because i'll be starting my sleep deprivation experiment and i'm probably going to be completely useless by friday
yeah i'm purposefully going to stay awake until i experience hallucinations
i was reading up on the effects of sleep deprivation the other day and i realized that there isn't actually that much hard info on the topic
there's a ton of websites and sources that say "people experience hallucinations at about 48-72 hours in" but then no one goes in depth about what those hallucinations are like or how it actually feels
i'm going to be writing hourly reports as an exhaustive effort to document the experience
i'm doing it for science
<@!146014279529791488> shut up heart murmur fuck
your weakness does not apply here, i will kalima your ass
i'm young i'll survive
misha, i'm actually counting on thursday streams to help keep me going
i don't do well without distractions, that'll occupy a good few hours
<:ree:475542526791516170>
are you people fucking morons
you don't die from 72 hours of no sleep
you have to stay up for like two weeks
i'm excited, i haven't done anything this imbecilic in a while
no of course not
i have it all planned out
okay, okay, enough
you guys have _convinced me_ to do a better job planning this out
i'm still going to do it but i'll set aside a solid couple weeks before i fuck myself up
yeah if you go without sleep ALL THE TIME
doing it once won't be an issue
it's like drinking until you blackout, just don't become an alcoholic
because i'm YOUNG AND RECKLESS
I NEED TO UNWIND
I GUESS NOTHIN' CAN LAST FOREVER
FOREVER, NO!
yeah i can probably get some kind of spotter
STANDIN' ON YOUR MAMA'S PORCH
yeah probably not
but i've pulled plenty of all nighters in the past
i think the longest i made it was about 40 hours but i didn't even want to, that was when i had a lot of traveling to do in a couple days and nothing was comfortable
<@!146014279529791488> that's when we went to boston
that was a lot of fun
i'm turning 26 this month
i'm like vaguely amused that you guys are all taking it this seriously
you all realize that i'm being flippant because i'm fucking around right
i would _like_ to do this but saeko is right, i probably won't make it that far in
i'll probably make it into the morning or afternoon of the next day and then pass out
well not according to all of these chucklefucks who are shitting their pants at the thought of me not sleeping for a few days
it's not like i'm going to be eating poison, christ
<@!257144766901256192> <@!146014279529791488> i know more about the human body than you do
it's not a good idea
i'm not doing it because it's a good idea
i'm doing it because i'm fucking curious what'll happen and i want to laboriously write down my experiences
THIS IS HOW PROGRESS IS MADE
THIS IS HOW THE WORLD WORKS
I WILL ACCELERATE HUMAN LEARNING TO THE NEXT DEGREE BY BECOMING ULTRA DELIRIOUS AND CAUSING SHORT TERM DAMAGE TO MYSELF
GET YOUR YAKISOBA
sorry that the BABY fucking DIES is keeping you awake
<@!146014279529791488> W    H    A    T    ?
i mean, it's 2:20 AM
but that's normal for me
i think i'm just experiencing a moment of hypomania, i've been really tired and lethargic lately
again, as much as i'm joking and laying out plans, i'm not sure i'll even end up doing this
probably gonna put it aside or forget in a few days
but while i'm on the topic, hooboy
i'm excited for it
it sounds fun in a mondo stupid way
SLAM DUNK
IT'S WHAT
WHAT IS IT
i need to make makin admin again, clearly i am too unstable for this job
hey how about you don't talk about family business in a server full of like 17,000 people you fucking mook
also more or less, i'm moving out by the end of july just because driving back and forth is fucking annoying
i'm not actually that bothered, it's just weird seeing real life stuff pop up in here
i want to put shit on my ass all day, is that okay
misha, i'm hardly one to talk because i've been casually flirting with the idea of really dangerous and stupid unhealthy stuff, but you should really treat yourself better than that
the BABY fucking DIES
get her fired, then all is well
<@!146014279529791488> baka
alright everyone shut the fuck up about old man cock
FUCK
LAST WARNING MOVE ON FROM THIS OR I FREEZE THE CHANNEL
alright, i didn't want to do this to a family member but nepotism is banne
YOU'RE OUTTA HERE
go to altgen and talk about aged male genitalia there
that's true
<@!146014279529791488> despite what i just said do not shitpost in altgen with that
just don't fucking talk about it in here at all
for real, if i see one more message about it i'm actually freezing the channel, though it seems most people have moved on
now we can all be civil
and talk about how we're watching more cobra kai tomorrow
because that show is fucking great

right, i meant today
it's 3 AM, i say "tomorrow" as a shorthand for "after i wake up"
<@!146014279529791488> <:Quiet:732864699779121162>
wow that looks fucking terrible in the smaller version
<:Quiet:732864699779121162>
that's better
honestly it kind of makes me laugh with the small version? something about how tiny the "QUIET" is
it's fucking adorable <:Quiet:732864699779121162>
also i just got semantic satiation for the word "quiet"
cy, it was quiet all day and then i don't know what happened
someone posted Good Ol' P.U. and we've been off the fucking rails ever since
that's fucking incredible
wait, do you just have an emote server
and i'm not on it
EVERYBODY BETRAY ME, I AM FED _UP_ WITH THIS WORL'
<@!546435257474220063> have you ever seen the room
alright, i was quoting it
CHECK YOUR FACTS
oh yeah, i can try playing lobotomy corps tomorrow when i've got some free time
looking forward to it
don't shame tensei, i've been there
like right now
i need to get back to higurashi and some other shit
yeah and then i uninstalled it
got my harddrive space back like a boss
i'm enjoying it well enough
also i just played halo 3 last night, why would i have reach uninstalled
idiot, charlatan, baka
tensei, i don't think i have the mental acuity required to even begin answering that question
what the fuck
do you think i'm actually drunk
yeah you raving dumbass
i've been sober as a whistle all night
alright well i guess i'll die
yeah, i really should
i have to get up early and drive
but i'm having such a nice time bullshitting around and acting like a lunatic
i agree, that man needs more potassium in his diet
i'm not even sleep deprived, this is well within my normal hours
i'm just fucking around more than usual
jesus christ you guys, lighten up
because my circadian rhythm has ALWAYS been fucked up
pretty sure pleo just said they've done sleep studies
if those don't turn anything up there's basically nothing that can be done
that having been said, i'm amazed that sleeping for 16 hours straight and in various unusual conditions DOESN'T turn something up
IT'S A _GAY_ BOMB
i am reorienting the server away from literature and socializing, and toward unjust suffering
in this server, self-esteem will be attained in only one way: racism
it is my intent that by the time you leave this server, you will be among the few your age to distinguish between kino and flicks
Yes
holy shit, i haven't seen this in years
let's see how well it's aged in the grand scheme of the internet
oh hey it's actually not that bad so far
the animation has that specifically horrible quality that i've missed so much in more recent animation
FUCK, i forgot about the character who is literally just christopher walken
well, do they
are you kidding
i use the autodocker all the time, that's 75 seconds of time i have to read something or scratch my ass
only you can answer that question
you only say that because you couldn't get past like the second miniboss
get good
sekiro is easily the best miyazaki game
"most optimally fun per dollar" w  h  a  t
oh sweet
i'm excited to see it
nah
at least not me, i'm out of commission
i have consummated
I HAVE NOT LUSTED
why is your server an online hazard warning
yeah, i need to talk in public server more often honestly
it's a fun time but i'm already bad about keeping up with MY irl friends
it's miraculous that i talk in here as much as i do
my favorite channel is still #posts_while_shitting though
<@!168980988477702145> fragments or something?
fugg i wish i knew more of them off the top of my head
i guess in general i like woc spurdoposting
<@!125433170047795200> you ever think about how spurdo looks like roastbeef's distant cousin
that doesn't make much sense
it's not like they make all 60,000 tweets in one go, it's spread out over a while
i assume, anyway
woc usually just DMs me shit like that directly, and worse besides
how many people are on there
it's like going to use a public restroom and casually chatting with anyone else who happens to also be in the stalls
i still remember when misha first posted that meme <:BOOMER:576174394720911400>
i'm reminded of something i said some time ago
it feels like my entire life is just waiting for the next time i laugh so hard that i physically cannot breathe
no
this is the mod casual hangout/nepotism channel
i talk about dero and woc talks about public call
i'm sure there are othr instances of this
such as....
.............
.......... benis
alright, that's enough public call posting
it's starting to smell in here
quality architecture posting
fuck it
let's all get together irl and build a monument
holy shit, i didn't know that
i've wanted to take a visit to the mediterranean  and the middle east to see some of the older sites of human civilization
i've always been a casual greekaboo
<:LUL:578126971079491594>
isn't the internet wonderful
i keep hoping that humans have ACTUALLY been observed by aliens so that they have a complete record of our history
i keep holding out hope for additional clay tablets or ANYTHING that'll help us decipher linear A
i burn to know the life of an average mycenean peasant, or the real name of a king
I NEED TO KNOW THE POLITICS AND WARS OF THE PALACE ERA
I HUNGER FOR ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE
why would the minoans be simps
if anything that would be the macedonians
fucking rolled over when the persians came in
yea but the macedonians especially were like "WE'LL HELP YOU AGAINST THE OTHER HELLENISTIC STATES"
they were like "yeah the writing's on the wall with this shit"
but then the battle of salamis happened and everyone was like "oh fuck"
thanks themistocles
i'm frequently amazed at how older scientists intuited this kind of shit
like, making first-of-its-kind discoveries
yeah
i remember reading about that at some point, where it was only comparatively recently that archaeologists started trying to _preserve_ the stuff they were digging up
destructive analysis was the most common way of studying old shit back until like the 19th century
then some dude was looking at fossils in asia and came up with a system that involved making a grid and labeling things extensively
and, y'know, not beating that shit with a pickaxe
pictures are better than literally nothing
but they also can't be trusted
i think a lot about the gardens of babylon
we have some engravings of what they _might_ have looked like
but there are no ruins to examine
so they could have looked like literally anything and we can't confirm it
i firmly believe that every cultural landmark/famous historical site that's become delapidated or was destroyed should be recreated
imagine going to greece and seeing the colossus of rhodes
you make me sad
the pyramids still exist for a reason
those shits are just giant stones
true, it's actually pretty decent conditions for preservation out there
sandstorms notwithstanding
<:reeeee:248154233352749056>
i miss when i used to go on wikipedia binges and learned this sort of thing overnight
i should really get back into random learning
fucking aimhackers
of course
not soon enoguh
i want to learn more jank history
in seriousness i could use some effective resources for learning world history, i'm not nearly as knowledgeable about african/asian history as i would like
or hell, pre-modern european history eithr
i mean, that's sensible enough
well, maybe
could be fun
shit, i'm going to be a failure my entire life, might as well be a failure who knows a shit ton of things
holy fucking crap
tori, thank you for existing
the laugh i just uttered was practically a titter
WAR
GAMES
WAR
GAMES
i say i need to read more about world history but then i hear shit like that and all of a sudden i want to reread game of champions
what
combos
the fuck you talkin' 'bout
it is possible, but not now
also i hate civ 6
it feels wrong
zeb
time for my annual watch of wombo combo
poor zhu
party smash is perfectly fine too
i used to be kind of a dick about that but there's really no point, competitive smash is definitely not for everyone
timed mode always feels weird, i agree
but sometimes that's what people prefer
i think we can all agree though, no one should ever, ever play on that weird fucking money mode
with the coins and shit
that shit SUCKS
wait
is that _the_ state twitter for ukraine
sometimes i love reality
i don't think there's any good places to see it around here dero
too many trees
shit are you serious
maybe next time i have good internet
i'll be free again on friday
zip zoom
what
nik did you see my fist coming for your face
to stroke it softly
did you guys hear about the new update they're pushing for Outside
apparently they're reworking the face models so that no one will be ugly anymore, but they're replacing the textures with masks while they do it
we'll fix that
by force
that fucking sucks
this year is just upping the bar for being fucking terrible
not the hero we needed, or deserved, or wanted
yeah, we saw that yesterday
rip grant
you were great
this is reality now
buckkle up
what do you mean
like it's happening more often or it's getting reported more frequently
it's very depressing at times to be bombarded with all of this information about the world
everything is complicated when you know more about what's going on
but at the same time, it's kind of wonderful
none of us would ever have known each other existed before something like this
i think that's rather incredible
yeah, grant died before 50 because of a fucking brain aneurysm, which is like the biological equivalent of a nega-lottery
poor guy
well, i just went out to look at neowise and i think i'm a bit too late for tonight
but i'm staying at a place where the light pollution is near zero, and for the first time in eight years i was able to see the galactic plane again
so all in all it was still a good night
<@!125433170047795200> even if it's just in a stupid video game, it's fun to think about all the places i've "been to" up there
why couldn't we have been born in an era of space travel dude
i don't envy anyone being born right now
i frequently think that it's immoral to have children with the world in the state it'll be in like 100 years
but withotu more people it'll be harder to fix the problem, so i don't really know
that's fair spiral
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
gonna try and get another glimpse of the comet in the morning
3:45-4:30 AM or so
i'm coherent and has themes, but only slightly
sometimes i'm very coherent and talk about themeing, but i'm dragged down by all the shitposting i do and also the themes being depressing
we need a linkybot bingo sheet
jojo fun, not bad but not as great as people make it out to be
i don't think i have any recent notes
oh shit i have three entries fully typed out
i say "fully typed out" loosely because two of them are short jokes
i was joking before but now i do want to make a list of linkybot bingo entries
meta comments, calls for violence, self-aware
i'm sure between all of us we could come up with like 50 spaces
YOUR TIME IS UP AND YOUR PAROLE'S BEGUN
YOU KNOW WHAT _THAT_ MEANS
alright that one got me
we can have it off for fifteen minutes
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
what the fuck
don't spam the command
even thoguh that's literally what we're doing right now
actually come up with a question or something at least
alright, that's enough for tonight
you get three more, use them wisely
nevermind
it's over
TWO your nastiness
after all, no one's ever _really_ gone
things are alright, i'm just chilling
i'm glad that my past messages regurgitated in a completely random fashion can bring joy to people
just don't show me you fucking wiener
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
why is nat still so harsh on me
well she's right, and also a gremlin, and also fake and gay
it's kind of amazing how pervasive "f" is as a meme
i feel like it's genuinely transcended just being a funny reference and is now like a ubiquitously accepted response on the internet
press f to put shit on your ass everyday

can't wait for this one to show up on linkybot
yeah
pretty unbecoming of a discord partner, isn't it
i can always just not look at that you fuck
but no, woc brings up a good point, this channel has been getting too shitposty and i should actually be making an effort to curtail it somewhat
you people have been making it hard to talk in a serious capacity
at this rate the knives might just have to come out lads
your threats mean nothing to me
sighhhhhhhh
yeah, alright
tonight was the last one
it's time to pack it in and actually try to be civilized from now on
at this rate why don't we just make makin the owner again
i don't know how much hussie would actually care, and i'm not sure i would care how much he cares either
we already did strip the name off of it practically, renaming this server "Homestuck Unofficial" was a direct and explicit effort to disavow ourselves from any sort of notion that we're officially tied to the property
after the negotiations soured near the very end we were fucking done with that idea
tera, we decided we're fine talking about it some time ago
it's been months and who cares
as linkybot says: homestuck is dead
not quite gnawms, but we have them compiled into a document if anyone demands the receipts
(mostly anyway, i still have to write a summary for anyone who oesn't want to read through fucking 40 pages of bullshit)
no, makin said "i don't think it's the best idea but you can talk about it"
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
shut up, it was already too late WAY before the negotiations happened
i emailed hussie about the toblerone bar makin picked up for me in taiwan
i was like "i feel bad about this, would you redeem a wish if we dropped it off somewhere else in asia"
my real name was attached to my email at that point, months before shit went down, so it was over way before it started
i don't think it'll matter very much though
anyway yeah, let me give the short explanation of what happened
i've been wanting to talk about this since fucking february
all y'all shut it for a minute
i want to state for the record that i explicitly secured our right to talk about this stuff openly during the original negotiations, and literally the only reason we haven't is because we wanted to avoid sullying WP even more than they've already done to themselves
with how things are going though, i don't think it matters anymore
so the deal is, literally _the last_ thing that makin wanted before he willingly stepped down was for kate not to post this huge fucking deal on twitlonger that was supposed to be a statement of no wrongdoing on our part
but it was filled with the kind of vile political doublespeak that you'd expect, which made us out to seem like bad guys anyway even though she willingly went after us with information that was proven to be completely false and alleged that we were a child porn ring
i also confirmed with hussie that kate would not be allowed to speak about the HSD or subreddit ever again since she was literally the main factor in escalating tensions as bad as they got
in the comments of the main post i made reference to this assuming it would be clear under that provision i mentioned, where i said we would be able to speak freely about all of the negotiations
kate saw my comment and fucking flipped out, so she posted the twitlonger thing even though her NOT posting it was literally the last thing makin wanted before handing the server over
to anyone working with more than a brainstem, it should be obvious that this was in flagrant violation of the spirit of what we were trying to do
between kate's vindictiveness and her general treatment of the fandom, the mod team as a whole decided to pen a "formal complaint" about her to hussie because to us it was clear that she was this hugely destructive force who didn't really give a shit beyond her own personal gratification
hussie responded to this by asking "what is the gender makeup of your mod team"
we were fucking stunned by this and said as much
then after we made our ire known he basically said "yeah, the fact that you're upset about this says really bad things to me about your mod team and culture, and now i want you to replace most of your team"
<@!146014279529791488> not right now
in fact never, we're cutting down on shitposting
not just US, she's been shitty to practically everyone
the fact that she was shitty to us was just kind of icing on the cake
yes, post the response woc, might as well
yeah, i want to be clear that this isn't an attempt to get hussie crucified or some asinine horse shit, we've just decided that it's time to stop hiding the proceedings of what happened because it "might damage the image" of a company that's basically already been destroyed
i think that's a bit too complicated woc, although i can't rule it out either
i think it's more likely that real life stuff got in the way and they just forgot
woc is literally the reason that we actually made it to the liaison step, without him i would probably have written another email telling off WP and officially cutting ties for good
but woc stepped in and went "no, we should probably at least try"
nah, there was no formal agreement, it was all "verbal handshakes"
which is kind of moronic when i think about it
in retrospect i don't actually know why we went to bat for the server in the first place, we didn't owe shit to anyone
we were literally accused of harboring child abusers by an official team member, it feels really weird that _we_ ended up making concessions for that
we floated the idea of naming the server "Homestuck: Beyond Official" but we decided that it would probably be too aggressive
also it didn't fit on the nameplate
nah, it's not a good name
homestuck unofficial is fine, i think it's grown on me even if it's kind of homely
dero we decided to stop being silent on the issue
not because we're taking any kind of stand, but just because it basically doesn't matter at this point
barring a miracle, homestuck has been killed dead and there's not much point in trying to avoid tarnishing the image of a company that's already rotting from the inside out
the official team has basically imploded, kate (the big troublemaker) left and homestuck 2 has been on hiatus for 2 months despite the fact that it was already crawling along at a snail's place
<@!132287296798982144> i would literally rather delete this server than let anyone even remotely affiliated with the official team have a single scrap of real control over it
WP has shown itself to be laughably incompetent at engaging with fans, if not outwardly hostile towards them
i'm just going to assume you're baiting at this point and move on
well, i'll agree with you there as far as incomprehensible is concerned
there are thousands of properties out there which enjoy a modicum of success and understand how to properly engage with their audience so that they can make sufficiently artistic stuff while also not bleeding money like stuck pigs
fuck art too apparently
it's honestly shameful mint
<@!146014279529791488> cool it
i don't like her either but there's no need for base insults
i mean
kate having an only fans is fine i guess, far be it from me to shame someone for engaging in sex work
but using a larger work you're working on professionally to shill it, especially when your audience is composed of a hefty number of minors??????????????????????????????
no, this particular avenue of discussion is a mess and i don't want to engage further
<@!132287296798982144> i take umbrage with that for two reasons: first you're assuming that the conversations taking place in this channel specifically are emblematic of the entire server, and i assure you they're not. further, the subreddit is larger and is composed of a much more diverse array of opinions, and literally _every day_ we get dozens of posts of people trying to discuss the comic and sharing art they made, cosplays, etc
so your claim that we give nothing back is fucking preposterous
second, i would argue that the official team created this monster, if it can be called that, on their own time by being incorrigible, narcissistic, overtly hostile bullies towards their audience
encouraging animosity towards the audience is probably the most imbecilic suggestion i've ever seen and the fact that you're resorting to these sorts of mental gymnastics to defend probably one of the worst official teams i've ever seen is really disappointing
i'd really like it if their response to criticism, well meant or no, didn't involve engaging in vitriolic and intellectually dishonest rhetoric that only serves to rile people up more
the overall point i'm making here is that at the rate we've been going, homestuck is getting exactly what it deserves, and i'm really fucking sad that it's even possible for me to say that
not just pedophiles, _child abusers_
<@!132287296798982144> the context is that a user named phoebe manufactured evidence to make it look like we were encouraging the bullying and abuse of server members and minors, kate ate it up and amplified that signal, then she and griever went so far as to post on the subreddit with a shitty bait and switch saying "makin and the mod team are running a child porn ring and anyone who supports this place deserves to be held liable for it"
that's the entire deal
at that point, hussie reached out to us and for some dumb reason, probably out of respect for him being the creator of the thing we fucking love so much, we tried to make amends by having makin step down, even though we were EXPLICITLY the ones maligned by false accusations of felonious activity
did we receive a single apology for being accused of abusing children? noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, in fact when we complained about this he softly demanded that we replace our entire staff
do you see why we're kind of pissed off about this?
it's been about six months since it happened and i've managed to stop thinking about it every day, but whenever it comes up it instantly puts me in a fucking foul mood
like, let me get something straight for you
none of this conversation means that we hate homestuck
the very point is that we love homestuck as it used to be and what it _could_ be
but in the interest of homestuck as a creative work, what's going on with it right now both artistically and on an official basis is basically ruining it
i'm going to state casually that i'm not sure i trust anyone on the official team right now to conduct themselves professionally or positively with the audience, which is basically half the battle lost already
"however you acted on other matters" like trying to mend bridges for months, including going to an official pgenpodcast live show and giving all of the participants scarves i made by hand as a fucking olive branch
no, i think i've said this elsewhere but i don't actually regret giving those people the things i made
the spirit of what i was trying to do was genuine
and you know what, kate actually seemed pretty chill that day
i was feeling really optimistic about building roads and making things better
but the kate that was interacting with us and accusing us of those things was NOT the person i met in chapel hill
kate is driven and creative and extremely resourceful, but she is also opportunistic and idealistic to a fault, to put it mildly
i have many more choice descriptors i would use for her
but suffice to say that i think her leaving the property is basically the only positive change it's seen since homestuck 2 started
<@!146014279529791488> dude shut the fuck up
you haven't even been a part of this community to engage in that kind of dialogue
i don't think that description fits kate at all to be honest
she clearly is engaged enough with irl shit, she's actually attending the protests which is impressive as its own thing
i just think that she's so driven that she'll resort to any means necessary to achieve what she wants
i haven't even mentioned that she tried to go to Discord to make them give WP this server
before the whole accusation of pedophile ring happened
it depends on what you mean rina
i guess the overall point is that dealing with this jaded me against the property i've read and loved for over 8 years and i strain against that every single day now
if it weren't for this place i would have just fucking disappeared near the end of february
that's most likely true sky, so why on earth would they slander us and try to fuck us over with underhanded means of taking over the server
first by going behind our backs and then by trying to get us to replace our mod team
literally none of this should have happened
no, it was vague screenshots of out of context situations that actually had nothing to do with us, except for stuff ceru said which was an outright lie
and a couple of screenshots that were straight up fabricated
no sky, i just mean in the last six months when kate actually, verifiably tried to take the discord and subreddit from us by contacting the admins on both platforms
and then also when hussie directly told me "i want you to replace most of your mod team"
what part of that sounds like a kooky conspiracy to you
wait, what
are you saying it's a conspiracy that they were justified in trying to do so? which would necessarily mean that it wasn't appropriate?? because i fucking agree with you there, it was wildly unprofessional and pretty explicitly unethical
oh yeah bambosh, i haven't even fucking commented on that
as soon as i took over the negotiations, i gave him detailed explanations of what was going on concurrently and in the past and i did it on a fucking silver platter
he then called it obfuscation and stonewalling, which really confused me for a long time
after considering it for a while i think it's most likely that he literally doesn't understand how running a discord server or a community in general works
and that he thinks it's this simple endeavor when in fact the infrastructure we have to keep track of things and manage things effectively is really fucking complicated
all of this is so god damn irritating in retrospect
every single time i think about it, it makes me frustrated that i wasted 8 years of my fucking life on this property that i've been an ardent fan of, and then i feel guilty because even despite this raging clusterfuck nightmare i still think it was worth dealing with because i genuinely love this place and the people in it
so the fact that i can be made to think "this wasn't worth it" for even a split second is insulting and infuriating
<@!132287296798982144> there was never any victims, as i explained all of the "evidence" was falsified
i explained this to him laboriously and he agreed very quickly that it was bullshit, at least from what i recall
at that point the negotiations should have ended immediately
the entire reason makin decided to step down is because all three of us agreed that things had degraded badly enough that there was no trust possible, which is why the accusations came forward in the first place
now that time has passed though, it's fairly obvious that that was horse shit, and we shouldn't have bothered bringing anything to the table when we were actively being slandered with a felony accusation
<@!132287296798982144> i still don't actually know for sure, but i think it had to do with the NSFW server and cerulean's involvement
which we handled as quickly and effectively as we possibly could have under the circumstances
i'm fine with re-explaining everything openly now that we've broken our silence about it
i want to reiterate that we literally avoided talking about this specifically because we didn't want to risk the possibility of ruining WP's reputation anymore
yeah that was a tad much
by which i mean shut up dude
the point of this conversation, i guess, is that everyone fucking lost
to all outward appearances the official team is in shambles and what is frequently pointed to as the biggest community still surrounding this work was maliciously, unjustly targeted by one of the creators of that work
no one comes out on top in this scenario
yeah, the amino is... something of an enigma
they have roughly the same number of people as the spread across the HSD/subreddit but as near as i can tell they are _completely_ separated from any inkling of fandom drama
though i don't exactly check, so i have no idea whether that's true
sky, that's literally incorrect
we log every ban we make, do you want to know how many of them are for getting rid of spam and harassment
the allegations were against the community as a whole, both the subreddit and the HSD
so about 75000 people all told
dero i already fulfilled that, you just weren't around for it
get fucked idiot
sky <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> what part of my explanation did you not witness
the part where kate literally tried to go through the discord/subreddit backdoors to forcibly seize control of this community, or the part where hussie himself literally told me i should replace the mod team
like i said, i would literally rather delete this server than give anyone on the official team even an ounce of real control or power over the community
they have proven time and time again that they do not have the interests of the community at heart
what i mean is that i'm heavily convinced they would get rid of anyone complaining about the comic, i don't trust them to tolerate dissidence
and also that
somehow i doubt that literally anyone on the official team has experience managing a community of this size
it's literally a part-time job with no compensation
i'm saying "literally" a lot, which is how you know i'm frustrated
eg
that is absolutely nuts sky
i don't even know how to frame an argument against it because the fact that you would even try to argue for that scenario in a serious capacity is fucking flabbergasting
also, how the hell is "the creator of a work should have total control over the community surrounding it" NOT at odds with "people can create whatever homestuck they want"
i am legitimately gobsmacked right now
yeah, i think i'm just done discussing this if "content creators should have total control over communities surrounding their work" is the unironic argument being made here
that is so profoundly batshit and susceptible to legit abuse that i can't even be assed to engage with it
sky, let me try to describe to you an actual interaction i had with kate about this server and the stuff that happens on it
she came to me one day complaining about how there are comments on the server that are inarguably transphobic
i said, "yeah, when we see those we delete them and ban the person responsible"
she said "but i still see comments like that"
i said "yeah, we're working on an entirely volunteer basis and usually rely on user reports to tell us when people are breaking the rules because we can't be watching the place 24/7"
as i recall, she took this to mean that we were excusing the harassment of trans people and not bothering to do anything about it
which is patently false, because as i explained when we become aware of sometone saying shit like that, we get rid of them
so i was really confused about this for a while, but i realized what was going on some months later
i'm reasonably certain that people on WP think this community is a bad place because "it attracts the kinds of people who are comfortable saying transphobic stuff" even though it's against our rules to do such a thing and we get rid of people that we see doing it
and i think that their logic is: the fact that it happens _at all_ means this place is problematic
which is fucking ridiculous
anyone who has ever run a community of more than a dozen people knows and understands implicitly that there are people on the internet who will invade your community and try to fuck things up regardless of its nature or tone
it is NOT a matter of "gestating" those individuals
it is a matter of those people joining and causing a problem before we even know they exist
so i'll say to you what i said to kate, sky: what you're asking of us isn't just unreasonable, it's physically impossible
you're trying to blame us for not being fucking psychic and banning people before they cause a problem in the first place
that is fucking outrageous and i refuse to be blamed for something that i literally cannot control
like, do you understand how many people there are here and on the subreddit
do you want me to do extensive reconnaissance on all 75,000+ members of this community to personally vet each and everyone of them, ignoring the fact that that's not even physically possible
do you realize how unreasonable and insane your expectations are
THAT is the problem i had with kate, she was asking for things that weren't even in the realm of distant possibility
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
as of right now there are 17,218 people on this server
let's just manually vet all of them, shall we
while we're at it, let's do it for the *checks reddit* 61,211 people on the subreddit, ignoring the fact that you literally can't know who all of the subscribers to your community are
"without a modded centralized community" oh, so you want people like talons, itoan, etc to be able to freely associate with and harass you with no recourse against them?
sure, that sounds like a _much_ better system
for the sake of my health, i don't think i can entertain this conversation anymore
if people have any specific questions then by all means ask, but i'm ducking out to play pokemon
that shiny gold sigma romhack i was talking about
it's basically crystal but on firered engine with all pokemon including sword and shield, plus hoenn i think?
i actually freely advocate that WP makes their own discord server
i have literally no idea why but tipsy i read that in the voice of mrs. doubtfire
i've never even see mrs. doubtfire
i guess i'm confused and frustrated because it feels like a lot of the things that are being levied against us are internally inconsistent or contradictory
if you want to be part of a small, unconcentrated group of people then why would you bother even associating with this place to begin with
just leave, that's always been an option
Buu
not Boo
<@!120187484863856640> when you can, check out the spat draft

w-what
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
damn makin, that's fucking weird
it's like old discord memes and figures are playing out their lives on the subreddit casually
i just had the most bizarre sensation reading that post
like staring into a slightly different alternate dimension
CE's legendary mode was enough to make me angery, 2's legendary i stopped trying to beat after 15 minutes because it was transparently fucked up
i do prefer heroic when i want to enjoy the game more casually but 3 legendary is not terrible at all
i think all three of the games have positives, and the interesting thing for halo is that all three of those games are good in different ways to each other
like you said, halo ce captures the pure essence of a space super soldier story, and halo 3 is like the most "realized" version of the halo saga
halo 2 thoguh i have a huge soft spot in my heart for managing to still mostly have that spirit of the first one, though diluted somewhat, and introducing a grander narrative to it without getting bogged down in the details
it's really good at basic visual storytelling
"you're part of the covenant now and all of these terms are getting flung around, but we don't really delve into the meaning of those terms beyond 'you kind of get what they're talking about'"
ehh
it's not an overly huge plot development
chief could have just tossed the bomb out of the station and nothing would realistically have changed about the story
him riding it and blowing up the cruiser are just set dressing at that point
the reclaimer stuff wasn't truly borked until halo 4 i think
that's when lore REALLY took a fucking nosedive
is when they started playing around with forerunner shit
the forerunners should never, ever have been brought to the front of the story in any capacity
leave them as an ancient dead alien species with hyper advanced tech
REEEEEEEEEE
i think it's that the stuff spartans could do is so outside the realm of usual human capability that they basically needed to be augmented super soldiers
i guess you could accomplish that with just the suit, but still
no, i'm speaking in an alternate universe misha is implying
where the spartans aren't a multi-segmented program spanning decades
and are rather just another arm of the UNSC that are like ultra marines
lmao right, they came within a hair's width of calling him an android
oh shit you're right
he's still a giant though, isn't he
pretty sure he's like 6'8 out of armor and 7'2 in it
FLIP THE ELEPHANT
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
can we talk about the space ships for a second
i was looking this up after finishing halo 2 again and some of the details were kind of strange to me
namely, the size of each class or whatever
yeah
i was curious about the size of each ship, and they do offer a concrete number to that
capital ships are fucking enormous
for reference: battlecruiser (truth and reconciliation) is 1,782 meters long, which is supposed to be their "capital ship" even though the heavy class cruisers are nearly twice that length
the UNSC infinity is touted at the beginning of 4 as the flagship and "now WE'RE the foremost force in the galaxy"
it's about 6,000 meters long
and that's impressive, sure, but then you consider that there's only one infinity against the remainder covenant forces which consist of like 8 trillion fucking pieces of shit
eh, abubu?
he was born in the 1800s, he would absolutely be dead by now regardless of suicide
yeah, he ate a cyanide capsule and a bullet in the bunker near the end of the war
yep, born in 1889
if he were still alive today he would be fucking 131 years old
i think we're safe
```A semi-legendary figure, Lao Tzu was usually portrayed as a 6th-century BC contemporary of Confucius, but some modern historians consider him to have lived during the Warring States period of the 4th century BC.[7] A central figure in Chinese culture, Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the Tang dynasty and modern people of the Li surname as a founder of their lineage. Laozi's work has been embraced by both various anti-authoritarian movements[8] and Chinese Legalism.[9]```
yeah no that's almost assuredly false
the longest lived human we know of is jeanne calment who dead at 122 years
probably this weekend if i get a chance
i think i'd like to play that and a bit of pokemon clover
i feel bad for dropping la-mulana 2 but that game requires a lot of attention and i don't have it right now
some other time probably
as it is, marble it up sounds great, i'll probably hook that the fuck up
fuck, i'm missing marble league?
god damn kamen rider
ROJO ROLLERS *raaaspberries*
wait are you serious
i guess that makes sense, wasn't sure why one chant was placed inside another
i'm a fake marble fan okay
yeah it's mostly arbitrary sky
i like the green ones because it's my favorite color, but maybe someone can get persuaded to like another group for fun
"yeah you have a point, the wisps really did well last year and i appreciate the captain's moxie"
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> yeah it's a meme
it's just fun to get involved in it
in seriousness, the attraction of marble league is in the relative production value and the soul put into making it seem like a "real" sports events
the dude has to set up literally everything to make it work with just the events, but he also has like bleachers and shit? custom chants for each team? he puts up result tallies and graphics?
it's a LOT of effort to go through for a fake ass toy sport
and the result is kind of endearing
yes
mety link an event
yeah but look at this shit
each team has UNIQUE MEMBERS
that's a stupid amount of detail for this kind of thing
and it has music
and this whole complicated ass set up
it's great in a silly way
ro-ro-robust _raaaaaspberries_
is there a video with all the chants
lmao
i'm not hyped at all for this
GSH was depressing
craig ferguson is criminally underrated as an entertainer, the late late night show with him as the host was fantastic
very earnest when he wanted or needed to be
it's okay, we already figured out where makin lives
we obtained his address through legal means
he lives on the moon
dr. pepper sucks my balls
root beer is the patrician's drink
fuck keurig
those little plastic cups are the worst
keurig cups are extremely pervasive and wasteful
```Can I recycle K-Cup¬Æ pods? Yes, you can recycle K-Cup¬Æ pods but only if you separate the pod components. ‚ÄúK-Cup¬Æ pods consist of a combination of plastic, aluminum, organic material (coffee grounds) and a paper filter. While all said items can be easily recycled separately, the K-Cup¬Æ pod as a whole cannot be recycled.```
smells like market space
can we get freeware coffee cups
<@!227181775221161984> yo, that single email was not the whole thing, you're basically taking the last email we had and pushing it out of context
which is fine because that one still sucks, but i'm actually compiling a complete transcript with a brief summary so people can inform themselves
would you mind clarifying on your post, kthxbye
thanks
enough of this
yes
welcome
have some vaporwave for your time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuWA-h2PHnk
i'm not available until later tonight i'm afraid
still taking care of fam, though the grandma is nappin' something fierce
she's really kicking sleep's ass
i just don't have my desktop
in about 4 or so hours
more if i have to work on compiling this email transcript, but i'm hoping to knock that out here in a bit
the email transcripts are complete, we're doing some checkovers to make sure that they're properly anonymized to protect people's identities and also avoid destroying the world
you will have your pound of flesh
your opinions aren't just simple, they're internally inconsistent to the point that they're fundamentally incompatible with each other
you still haven't responded to the point that you're arguing simultaneously for a community that is decentralized and made of little groups that are basically distinctly separate from each other, and ALSO arguing that the content creators should have complete and total control over the community as a whole
these things just don't fucking work together, which is putting aside the fact that they're both terrible ideas
why on earth would i bother to disentangle _your opinions_
the mod team's reaction to the full emails is already interesting, though of course there's a lot of bias there so take that as you will
"Fans should not exist" is the kind of idealistic statement that i can distantly understand, but it's so profoundly disconnected from how things actually work that any attempt to make a system where that's the case is doomed to failure from the start
no, i mean
i agree with "abolish capitalism" as an end but that doesn't really help us in the here and now where capitalism is still a system and content creators are beholden to their audience in order to be successful
arguing in the ideal case does not wipe away the reality of what's going on
sky, you're really starting to live up to your self-proclaimed incoherency
your statements are starting to resemble gobbledegook
i'm getting kind of annoyed at how abstruse you're being, either on purpose or incidentally
<@!205026834205769748> obtuse and abstruse do not mean the same thing, i specifically used "abstruse" because that was more accurate to what's happening
you fucking wiener
obtuse means "annoyingly insensitive or slow to understand," abstruse means "difficult to understand or obscure"
strictly speaking skyplayer is being both but i'm more concerned about the part where she's only loosely describing her arguments and avoiding talking about the contradictions that arise from them
i'm giving the mod chat another hour to review the transcripts, i'll follow up on their suggestions and release them when i get back
<@!190973938556207115> i spent a few months in aysha's personal server specifically in an attempt to mend bridges and understand their perspective better
it didn't really help
the subreddit is 90% people posting fanart and cosplays, 8% shitposting, 1.999% discussing and theorizing, and 0.001% being awful
that sounds like hyperbole but it's actually not, i literally went and conducted a census of posts spanning like a 3 month period
what is your idea of garbage in this context
because the point still stands that 90% of the subreddit is people posting their content or the content of other people to share it with other people
so where's the beef, is what i'm asking
of the remaining 10% most of that isn't awful either
so what i'm getting from that is you're comfortable condemning upwards of 95% of a community for the actions of a small minority who mostly get handled
both
okay, please reiterate your point then
guys cool it, i'm trying not to jump down anyone's throat, i actually kind of want to talk about this
nah that's a fair point kreuz
nah
putnam what i'm getting from this is that WP, while not blameless themselves, are valid in their perceptions that the HSD and subreddit are awful places
i feel like we're getting sidetracked here by this argument between jamie and putnam
i understand that tensions are high over this disagreement but this tangent is becoming kind of indulgent
protracted
it's okay jamie, thanks for apologizing
qweq is the next dingus
makin stop derailing i kind of want to actually see where this is going
no, i don't think taking this to DMs actually helps
this is an open discussion of what's happening and why
i guess it's run its course though
me watching this conversation unfold
i did a bit earlier today
will play again before i go to bed
nahj
i'll do that some other time if i get more used to it
anyway we're almost done reviewing the emails
i mean, i'll feel better
i've felt guilty about keeping things hidden for the better part of half a year
i think that everyone has an obligation to the truth and keeping things secret doesn't really sit well with me unless there's a DAMN good reason for it
i think what putnam is saying is more that external perception of this place is that everyone is a revlar figure
okay, i was following you but now i'm fucking lost too
gitaxian, what the actual hell is stupid about that post
i don't understand
oh my fucking god
alright, i'm moving on
the transcript is ready, enjoy

don't thank me, i've been annoyed as fuck that we kept this secret for six months
i don't actually expect anything to come out of this at this point
but there are a few outcomes i guess
1) people are insanely pissed that we release this because it makes WP look even worse than they already do
2) no one gives a shit
two possibilities real
oh yeah, i need to do THAT too
fucking hell, what a busy night
anyway enjoy reading through the source of my massively increased cynicism and anxiety for the last half of a year
it's literally pinned carl
solar i don't think i actually care that much
if people get pissed off at us for being transparent that's their problem
i explicitly secured permission directly from hussie to talk about these proceedings openly
that's all there is to be said on the matter
and EVEN THEN we waited half a year to distribute this because we were afraid it would hurt WP
no shut up and read, inform yourselves
yeah, that turned out to be bullshit sky
keep reading
i think hussie was kind of justified in getting weird/defensive based on makin's initial responses, but the vague threats of getting "heavy-handed" was not appropriate
as far as i recall skyplayer was literally never involved at any stage of negotiations
by which i mean her name did not come up
oh wait i forgot that makin's emails are also included, totally possible he mentioned you
i avoided looking at those emails for too long, too cringey
mine are kind of obsequious though so it's fair play
<:therapist:308518860653461504>
it's me, diplomat man
that was a really rough week
oh right i actually helped construct one of makin's email responses, and i was keeping it more defensive to match his tone
that didn't end up well
no, it's only my name
makin has been smarter than me about that
i want to describe that shortly after the email shit concluded, we had a discussion about possible retaliation against us
i forget what exactly sparked that discussion but we laboriously went over all of the possible outcomes and determined that the least extreme would be a denouncement on twitter, but the most extreme would be legal action
i'm going to work on converting this document, the spat entries i've written, and tera's meme explanation into HTML to post on the website
you guys have fun, ping me if anything comes up or if you want to stroke my greedy fucking ego for being decent at diplomatic relations
what are you talking about tarty
holy fuck i love you krato, thank you for that
ah
oh yeah, were you ever going to get around to mailing that other toblerone to me makin
or are you going to burn it in a fire
because i would if you didn't
this is a joke
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that's perhaps the best outcome
<@!249134046846779398> because i feel like i have an obligation to the truth, and the only reason we didn't immediately release the transcripts was because we were worried about harming WP's reputation following already extensive and tumultuous negotiations
we didn't just not sign anything, i specifically secured permission to speak openly about these proceedings, yes
shit, i was worried about the possibility of the search and replace function being weird
still works
that's a PDF thing, i could fix it by just releasing a docx instead
let's not exaggerate, they were just subtle, implicit threats
no one at any point said "lawsuit"
well, take it as you wish
it's because phoebe's plan ultimately didn't work
after causing chaos to get makin and kate at each other's throats, she wanted to try and get a spot on the official team due to her contributions to the original comic
after this debacle went down though i think she was effectively blacklisted
<:PepeHands:547970973497032706>
i have an extensive array of spies who infiltrate all corners of the realm to bring me information that i use to further my sinister agenda
by which i mean someone in the mod team had it and showed it to me
tera you're probably going to want to take a break then
this isn't going away anytime soon
it's a valid point, but largely not important when considering the rest of what occurred
yeah, PR is a pretty weasley profession
you have to be pretty skilled at navigating dumb situations to be effective at it
then explain those screenshots
we were just doing our due diligence qweq
yeah, we have our disagreements frequently but i appreciate that you're taking time to put due diligence into this and critically analyze it
latula
HOLY SHIT PUTNAM DIDN'T JUST LEAVE THE SERVER
oh hi mark
<@!120187484863856640> that was after you had handed off the community and went to bed, i didn't share the screenshots with you because by the time i woke up in the morning you were like "nah it's okay, i won't ask for the community back"
also barkley that part of the transcripts is particularly laughable because i'm 100% certain that our mod team is philosophically and demographically more diverse than WP has ever been
that's the more concerning part because it actually matters
alright cookie, take care of yourself
i hear you, trust me
yeah, i had at least two mods who said "this makes me completely uncomfortable, i do not want to stay here"
both of them ended up staying, which i am immensely grateful for
i'm actually converting it to html soon but i do have it up on google docs
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ou0vLaAZ8GZwJrKFGiicjDUb-fE-JdNzRU7vylq1upA/edit?usp=sharing
ifnar is constantly arguing with us about stuff that the rest of us take for granted
it's actually quite admirable
some memes though
i think we've already shared those
oh yeah
shit
i'm finishing up spat
i can convert the enormous fucking transcript to HTML later, i'll just release the main thing
sky, i don't really know what to say at this point
you've been regurgitating opinions i've already heard in various forms from WP people and those in their orbit
it makes me really sad
that's probably for the best
let her work out her cognitive dissonance on her own
misha, knock it off
does anyone who is in the midst of cognitive dissonance call it cognitive dissonance
also i want to point out that it's probably _not_ a coincidence that everyone who says shit like this and leaves ends up somewhere in orbit around WP
yeah, sorry, that was a really uncharitable statement
i guess sky just genuinely believes this stuff
which is almost more dispiriting than the alternative
<@!207991389613457408> nearly done, uploading the files to my hosting service and hopefully should be done for the night
thanks nostalgic, i appreciate it
thankfully the stuff in the emails is not usually a problem we have to deal with
i want to reiterate once more that we aren't releasing this in any sort of official capacity in order to cause trouble, we literally just decided that keeping this a secret anymore was pointless
we had already directly secured our right to talk about the negotiations with the community, and we were only refraining from doing so because we were worried about hurting WP's reputation
as if tonight's discussions weren't enough, spat update https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/bookii2020.html#23J
alright sure fartor
the art's reception was really bad, the route itself was kind of lukewarm
i wouldn't say universally positive
it had problems
anyway i'm here fartor, invite me
or perish
oh fug
i forgot i keep putting myself as invisible
fair enough
the art sucked
i kid it wasn't that bad
people were weirded out that she was portrayed as overly chubby but that shit doesn't really matter that much
by "that shit" i mean "jane being chubby"
people being weird and overly upset about it are bad
```"Would you like to see your wife in something long and flowing?"

"Yeah, a river."```
yeah carl
solid
it has been done
indeed
also what is it nat
it's kind of annoying isn't it
hoh shit
i'm sorry to hear that, unless that's a thing you wanted to happen
well what's the server about

oh christ
alright what is it
yeah actually, although i can't recall specifics
some plants emit large volumes of gas in response to certain stimuli
one example would be releasing the hormone ethylene in response to disturbance that then causes surrounding plants to also emit ethylene
there are also situations where a plant might release a lot of the oxygen or carbon dioxide in its leaves
obviously not the same thing as farting but about as close as you could get outside the animal kingdom
head ass
that's the spice
<@!168980988477702145> this video is giving me fucking anxiety
check mentions me from tera
wait, i can literally just post it
https://youtu.be/FIw-HUP7XK0
now i'm sad
carlarc's embarrassment on display yet again
https://medium.com/@inspire2serveUS/mandatory-service-around-the-globe-c05e11810cfc
well, consider it this way tm
if you had an employee who openly disparaged your customers, what would you do about it
okay, then let's assume that she's not "an employee"
she is still getting paid to do work involving a property that he owns or owned, and who he endorses as a member of "an official team" that's in charge of creating content for that property
putting aside the dribble-inducing pedantry needed to say "that still doesn't make her an employee," you'd think that he would enact some kind of fucking control over people who are actively engaging with his product
he apparently has enough pull that he was able to "talk to her as seriously as he could" and make her decide not to release that statement at first
but then as soon as she decided to break rank anyway he was like "well, my part is done, you guys can deal with it yourselves"
i don't actually want homestuck to be open source, because that's kind of the whole thing they've been trying to push for the last couple months and from what we've seen that idea fucking _sucks_
nat has really calmed down in the last year
i'm proud of her
TOO
BIG
what are we talking abuot
hoh shit
yeah we can do game night
i veto board game online
i have never, ever liked that shit
i want to do superfight again personally
that's because game night isn't like a solid institutionalized thing
i think you've been spoiled by makin hogging concrete time tables for the last few months
game night is "are there a bunch of people online who all want to play something"
if yes then we go
if no then it doesn't happen
end flowchart
death
<@&711911237700681789> should we do a game right now? if yes, put forth suggestions
oh fuck we can do monopoly thjat's right
<@!168980988477702145> <@!108778093631533056> are either of you around
no
it's usually the result of a slow burn chemical reaction
one of the most commonly used bioluminescent chemicals is a protein called "Green Fluorescent Protein," or GFP
it comes from jellyfish
i don't remember what the mechanism of action is precisely but i'm fairly certain that the protein burns ATP in order to generate light
anyway to answer your question no, most glowing stuff is not because of pockets of bacteria
lmao
a preview of the HSD themed monopoly board
<@!168980988477702145> i don't want to do this without you but people are getting antsy
i think hsd monopoly is ready now
alright we're gonna play tonight provided that tera gets back soon
i definitely don't want to play the inaugural game of HSD monopoly with it, considering it MADE the thing
yeah, i'll ping when it's time to begin
<@&711911237700681789> i will ping again when it's time to start HSD monopoly, don't touch that dial
fucking phantos, lingering like a specter as always
<@&711911237700681789> tera is here, shall we monopoly? join in voice chat if yes
i'm actually enjoying it a lot
unbelievable nonsense
what? please explain
interdasting
also yes makin most or all of that photosynthetic capability is due to it eating algae
i know the organism you're talking about
i haven't read any of them but apparently studies have already determined that that capability is not transferable to other organisms, the metabolic complexity is way too high still
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> jesus christ
i mean, really, is there any reason to keep that a secret
it's honestly totally predictable at this point
my ass
yeah i did tera
do you know how humiliating is
to have a SERVER
that's an excellent idea
you guys need to stop playing stardew and start playing TTS with us
üî™
i meant in the future dumbass
when we play other shit
we've tried to do superfight once or twice and you were both BUSY
unbelievable horse shit
oh, does it annoy you that badly
yeah, fair enough
i guess it would just feel self-indulgent to make an entire voice channel for it
That's pretty much how it goes?
qweq is a trip uncle funkle

ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE YOU
no?
oh god, right
i did see that this morning, it was almost nervewracking
yeah it was like a barrage of noise
not very fun to listen to
yawn
elon musk being a weirdo as usual
holy shit
holy _shit_
100% appropriate response
death
that's kind of how being here works
yeah i agree
it just takes a while
we need a whole day for it practically
with 4 people only it'd probably be better
nice
Lucky, theres cloud cover here
Hoping to snag a look tomorrow
i'm not gonna lie guys, i feel better than i have in like half a year
i didn't realize how much keeping that stuff secret was impacting my mental wellbeing
thanks for being supportive, i hope you're all having a good night
yeah, i'm discoursed out for today at least
probably more tomorrow
oh yeah we should do another campaign mission real fast
i want to finish up this hard mode run of sekiro but it can wait, halo comes first
<@!108778093631533056> <@!274676805372215297> you guys awake
we're thinking halo
i could use a couple rounds of multiplayer anyway
sure barry, i think that'd be fine
fugg we just started a multiplayer game
i'll make them get you in next time
yeah b3es
<@!209777582600749057> <@!108778093631533056> get in here
it really feels like 2007 again
swag meister
autobots rollout
too bad you didn't download halo 3
we're having fun with multiplayer, even though it's 1/4
had a disappointing string of losses but we're BACK IN THE GAME BAYBEE
protland oregon or rpraltnadn maine
CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRABBO
such an infectious meme for basically no reason
hard truth, brother
hard truth
i'm sure there are mines, they probably don't feel like speaking up though
why the fuck is crabbo so good
which i feel kind of weird about, seeing as we try to encourage diverse opinions at least verbally
but i think it's hard to justify being in support of various shit
so those people probably just avoid talking about it
or hell, maybe there AREN'T any here
this place isn't exactly a hotbed of conservative thought
anytime anyone here says "at gunpoint" i just think of that one deep fried image of gru pointing a gun at the viewer and saying "delete that shit right now"
stellar idea
yeah, people pissed their pants about it so i was like "alright no go"
i still want to do it SOMETIME but perhaps with more safety measures in place than what i had in mind, which was basically nothing
the response to the emails being released is way better than i expected to be honest
i was fully expecting to be told by basically everyone that we were overreacting or absolute bastards for releasing the transcripts
but it seems that a hefty majority of the comments are getting something out of it or even openly say they appreciate the release/us handling things, so that's nice
perhaps that's to be expected from a community we're directly in charge of but it's still good to know we're properly representing our community
i don't know who would spot me
who has 72 hours to bullshit around and help me damage my health
of course it's not, but i want to do it for science and also because i have a weird impulse for self-destruction but ONLY if it'll be informative or a unique experience without being permanently damaging
what, you become incontinent
smeevs just check the subreddit post, it's a link to the PDF
oh yeah, for anyone who particularly cares, hussie reached out to me earlier this evening but through one of his employees only
the only message was "he is not happy about this and no longer wants to talk with you or makin"
i mean, it was smart on his part if he's afraid of having transcripts of the conversations in question
.... /r/homestuck
we do b3es, but the complaint basically came down to "but not copypasting the whole email chain"
which is kind of weird to me
what no lat
they know what the document is, it's not exactly hard to find
or, what do you mean
bah, whatever
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> no, he's mad that we posted the transcripts at all
i think he had the expectation that we would only talk about it in shorthand, but that doesn't really make much sense to me
why on earth would we prefer to post a version of events that are colored through our own perception
much better to have access to the entire thing so that people can make their own conclusions without being influenced by anyone else conveying it to them
well, for fuck's sake woc
it's been like a funeral dirge in there ever since the negotiations ended
i've been subconsciously dreading further contact with WP or hussie and now that the possibility is behind us, i feel unbelievably relieved
seriously, it's like a veil has been taken off my mind
i mean, i guess we go back to how it's been for years already
uncomfortable, chilly silence between here and there
with occasional flareups
<@!257144766901256192> that is over the line
knock it off
i genuinely doubt that it'll come to that, but if they sue us what grounds would it even be on
also we could probably countersue for, y'know, criminal slander
yeah, no
trust me, i spent something like 3 years trying my hardest to mend bridges and get the official team and HSD back to establishing a dialogue
after this, i think they should stay far the fuck away from us
if they want a community that they can exert direct control and influence over, they need to make it themselves
i don't think they would succeed because they're openly antagonistic to their fanbase
that's the real crux of the problem
if hussie advertised it i'm sure their usercount would balloon out rapidly, but i don't know to what number exactly
i honestly have doubts that the fanbase for homestuck exceeds five digits anymore
even if they did manage to overtake us in raw usercount, there's a question of user activity and engagement
i'm pretty sure all of them would fucking suck at that and their server would die
but hey, if any WP people or their friends happen to be watching this conversation, i fully endorse you making your own space to talk in
i'd love to see how that turns out
best case scenario is that their community actually turns out great and spurs a new era in fan engagement
i would genuinely be happy for that outcome
like, i get the impression that everyone on the team still thinks we're actively looking forward to seeing them fail
and granted, there's a number of people in our community who say shit like that and i don't enjoy it
but most of us are here because we love the property and want it to flourish
if they do shit that is the opposite of making that happen of course we're going to be fucking upset
any community in its right mind would point out when someone is fucking their own shit up
the negotiations kind of indicated to me that the official team and/or hussie himself have this weird view of how a fanbase and content creators should interact with each other though
to be specific, i think they're entitled
BRINGING THAT DEEPCUT BACK
one second i need water
<@!87363246360649728> sorry about that, what was your question
wait, what
oh
well, i want to take a step back and describe the typical relationship between communities and the things they enjoy
things exist to be art or make money, sometimes both
usually the way this works is that someone makes a thing and puts it out there for people to look at and if people like it they'll go "yeah okay" and pay money for it
when that happens, the person who made the thing in the first place usually says "thank you for enjoying my work and paying me, this is nice"
that's not what's happening here
the attitude from the main team for a while, and especially from kate when she was on it, was "you can pay for my shit or get the fuck out of my face" and then whenever someone DID pay for it or tried to talk about it in a less than perfectly praising way, they spat in the fans' face and sent them on their way
misha was talking about this in detail one night, where almost every property is run by people who are either quiet about what they do or are optimally engaged and affable in what they do
homestuck is one of the only properties i've seen where the creators of it openly, actively antagonize their fan base and then get uppity when people are upset about that
does that answer your question
no problem
oh, and yeah, i don't want to make it seem like the fanbase is perfect, clearly it isn't
obviously the HSD and the subreddit have had its fair share of problems and critical errors
but i think that the onus is on the content creators to work with or around that, specifically because they're getting paid to do their shit by the fanbase
like
as i said, we're not perfect
HSD has had some serious problems in the past
but i want to point out that none of us get paid to handle a community of 75,000+ people? this is an entirely volunteer basis
why is it that we're more organized, transparent, and effective than the official team for this property
it's kind of fucking ridiculous when you think aobut it
yeah, thanks lat
usually it's sufficient to get rid of one or a few people, but alths was just not working out
it would have been great to keep a shitposting channel for just homestuck memes
but it was getting used for inappropriate stuff too consistently
eh, kind of lat, but i odn't think that justifies how they've handled all this
like i said, the onus is on content creators to work around or with the insufficiencies of their fanbase because they get money and we do not
if they want to continue working on the thing that everyone likes and being compensated for it, then they necessarily are obligated to appeal to their fanbase
if they don't feel comfortable with that, that's fine, but they will necessarily incur some kind of cost
either leaving or taking a hit to their reputation with the people who enjoy their shit
i'm not sure that i entirely agree with the premise you're putting forth, communities definitely aren't monolithic no matter how often people try to portray them that way
fair enough
hangout was removed because it was sucking all of the activity out of general
wait, what
sorry, i'm playing sekiro and only looking here every so often
branora? huh
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
<@!535230374146605057> come participate in this discussion, you're being talked about
well, not like we're going to do anything about it right this second
i was just talking about being transparent but i just realized this isn't obvious to people
lat, part of giving people chances and not banning them the second they do shit wrong is stuff like this
you don't see this part because we keep it to ourselves, but we do this a lot
reaching out to people to see what they're doing and why
asking for explanations of their behavior
also we DO ban people who are operating clearly past the line and don't deserve consideration, but we also can't... do that all the time
primarily because often enough we don't actually see it happen
like i said, this is on a volunteer basis and all of the mod team has lives
i described in our explanation of modding that we rely a lot on user reports to take care of problems, and even then we don't always agree with a user that something is a problem
it's fucking complicated trying to adjudicate these things properly and the end result is that not everyone is going to be happy
not all 17,000 people in this server talk but there's still an outrageous amount who do, and a team of like 25 trustworthy people has their work cut out for them
yeah, that definitely sounds like branora from the few encounters i've had with them
i'm not gonna lie, branora hasn't exactly endeared themselves to the mod team
i would class them in that category of users who would crop up in our radar as borderline problem makers
but then they disappear for a while so we forget about them
there's an uncomfortable number of those people
i think there's really bad shit with viceroy but don't take my word on that, my memory is hazy at all times
it's okay
UGH
glad you're treating yourself
how the actual fuck do you have a community on instagram
isn't it just posting pictures
isn't that just fucking twitter
yeah i updated yesterday, someone link it i'm too hot and too tired to continue
oh sorry daniel, that's an outdated page
i changed the site around in a restructure a couple months ago
what the actual hell is a dreamwidth
they propped my corpse up in the corner so it'd look like things were still going
<:Quiet:732864699779121162>
"never"
>>>heavies turned off
SHAMEFUL
that's okay though it was still fun
i legit don't even mind that we only won once
it was just great to be playing halo 3 multi again
oh, fuck yeah i'll agree
utah sucked
holy shit, what a night that was
just had a great sekiro experience
i'm in the middle of fighting true corrupted monk and that boss does a lot of flipping around and distancing from you during the fight in the first phase
as soon as it started a backflip to move away, microsoft one office put up a notification on my desktop and automatically minimized the game
my heart stopped for a second because i thought the game froze, but i closed the notification and put the window back up just in time to start fighting properly again
all in all, everything was okay
yeah it does grim, so i'm really confused how one note or whatever managed to bypass that
i think i mostly agree with that list
2a's soundtrack is an immense disappointment compared to the original game
like, god damn
<:Quiet:732864699779121162>
he just did it
look up
oh fuck
i think i just banned the person who was trying to contact us for help?
even though they did it in the most asinine possible
don't ping every single mod individually
let me go see if that was a mistake
yeah, after reviewing the profile, they had no messages on this server before today
are we both talking about the same person
i'm talking about edgelordfridge123

then i'm wrong
i'll unban the guy

you make me sad

we know why it happens kind of, but not how to stop it
tensei, do you remember how wasted i was when i played sekiro on stream
i am just as drunk but with all the practice from doing the kuro's charm + bell demon and no prayer beads or attack upgrades runs, i am fucking blasting through this game like nobody's business
i want to stream a speedru  n of this at some point
i am having a blast
what is with car
how dare you
i'll have you know i beat the tutorial for lobotomy corps like two days ago
and will begin playing the first day asap
have faith, arthur
HAVE
FAITH
you know what, fuck y'all
i'm gonna get in gaming VC, mute myself, but stream myself running this shit
you'll see
oohugh
reminder that i'm streaming myself on discord doing a speedrun of sekiro
i'm already like 75% done and will probably finish in less than an hour
ree ree, etc
self plug over
fucking lobo corps posters
i'm doing alright
after we stopped playing halo i immediately started up a new game of sekiro while still blasted, and then beat the game without dying once in five hours
well, "true" dying
wheals i'm not doing the no sleep thing
i was convinced it's a bad idea
i just did last night
i have done that before
not that part
i don't know, i guess i'll try that out when i feel like fucking dying
anyone hydrox cookies in here
all of my scars are boring or stupid, usually burns from making food especially at mcdonalds
one of them though is from when i moved to graduate school, i thought i needed to set up a mailbox which i had never done before
i had no tools to do it but i bought a mailbox kit anyway
instead of a hammer i decided to try and use a 10 pound weight from a weightlifting set i had
promptly smashed my left middle finger on the mailbox pole, nearly cut part of it off
still have the scar from it healing back on, very strange experience
holy shit
gnawms was talking to andrew
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
```The umbilical cord has long fascinated physicians. Hippocrates and Galen postulated its role in fetal nutrition. Trotula provided specific instructions for cord cutting: it should be tied, a charm spoken during the cutting, and then wrapped 'with the string of an instrument that is plucked or bowed.``` fascinating
DARE is probably one of the most visible failures of school health and safety programs
DARE stands for "Drug Abuse Resistance Education" and was a program common in a lot of american schools back in the early 2000s
as per the name it talked about drugs and how they were bad for you, but what they actually di was blow the information way out of proportion
i'm not sure how bad it was everywhere else, but for example when i was in fifth grade we had a DARE officer come to us and literally say "if you smoke weed, you'll die."
if you do weed one to five times, you're fine
do it more than five times, and you're hooked for life
quit cold turkey? you die
do it 100 times? you die
fuck, right, i forgot about that
yeah well i did acid once in undergraduate school and now i have a master's degree
suck on that, statistics
weed affects people differently lat
hell, even just the method of intake affects people differently
my former friend up in canada literally couldn't get high on edibles no matter how many she took, but smoking it was fun
conversely, i can't smoke weed both because i hate smoking anything and because it doesn't make me feel anything, but edibles? whoo boy
that shit sends me into orbit
that having been said, it's probably for the best that you're just not doing it
can you use your godhood to give me a million dollars
what the hell kind of religion is this
i'm with woc
well yeah, it's basic pavlovian shit
if you enjoy the feeling of getting high and smoke weed all the time you're going to start liking the smell
also no woc, but i had a dog that did once
our mom didn't take care of our pets so i had to clean him off myself
yeah, it's practically acrid
i didn't know that my nose could hurt from a smel
it was that and then sniffing a jar of mustard up close
yeah, we got pavlov'd in the opposite direction
yeah, it's powerful
the worst thing i've ever smelled was a thiol compound during a laboratory experiment in class one time
you learn very quickly in biology that sulfur is not an element that you fuck with
thiols are a class of organic compounds that contain a group of atoms with a sulfur and hydrogen attached
they are fucking outrageously smelly
one time at my undergraduate institution someone accidentally left a bottle of the stuff open for about five minutes outside of the fume hood and they ahd to evacuate the entire building
i don't have to imagine, i was literally exposed to the smell because we needed it for dna extraction
take woc's description of burning tires, except throw in some rotten eggs and barf for  good measure
<:WutFace:459126920349483029>
i have a tear leaking out of my eye just imagining it, god
it's what makes you funny gnawms
you've experienced terrible shit and now you do your best to forget
ah, we're talking dissections now
let me rattle off the list
hard to remember high school anatomy class
pretty sure i've done two bullfrogs, two squids, a starfish, two fetal pigs, sheep brain/eyes, a baby shark, an earthworm, and something else i can't remember
get fucked idiot
if i ever find myself down in brazil, i'm going to be hitting you up for some genuine butchery experience misha
there's not a lot of opportunities for it where i live right now
i don't look forward to the actual slaughter aspect of it, i have too much compassion for animals to really _take joy_ in the killing part
but like, at the end of the day they're gonna be food
just kind of a thing
i feel bad about it in the same sense that i feel bad when i run over an opossum
it fucking sucks but that's the way it is
dude, woc
last night i was out looking for neowise with dad (found it by the way)
on the way back, a possum waddled out in front of my car
i wasn't going too fast so i slowed down for it to get spooked and turn back
but the stupid fuck LITERALLY DASHED IN FRONT AND UNDERNEATH MY CAR
so it goes about as you might expect, i hear "bathump-a-thump" and i get fucking angry because this dumbass animal did not understand what was happening
i just imagine your grandma going "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" while doing it
that'll do
i've never caught a lobster but being raised as a dumb hick we were really fond of going to local streams and handfishing for crawdads
never had that happen, though my dad did once hit an owl with his work van
go figure
it was honestly quite comical, the owl fly right in front of his windshield and did a little roll on it
left a dusty imprint and everything
no the owl died
lmao yep, that's the one i was thinking of
it's either that or fabio getting hit by a goose while he's on a rollercoaster
yeah, we felt pretty bad for it
it was still alive when we found it but the dude was really badly injured so we picked it up, put it in a box with a soft blanket and took it home to die in peace
yeah the thing with neowise is that it was MUCH smaller than i was led to believe
if i hadn't had my dad there, i would never have found it
it was less like a star and more like a dim blur
you need binoculars to see anything good
what makes you say that
Good
<@184545248930693120> I'm trying an impossible whopper, will report back with results

I know what to expect
<@!168980988477702145> ask them what they mean by "reorganized"
but why
this immediately sounds like bullshit
the precise order of nucleotides insofar as they code for sets of genes doesn't ALWAYS matter, but often enough it does
like, there are specific pieces of a given gene or gene cluster that need to go in order or it doesn't work
on larger scale, you have the chromosomes, where certain autosomes tend to code for certain things
if that isn't happening anymore, and you suddenly find a gene in a different location from where it was?
then you have a fucking autosomal disorder
oh, so this is someone bullshitting you
just stop talking to them
THAT'S WHY THE WHEEL OF THE WORST WA DESIGNED
i think they're talking about on a larger scale barkley, and not with reference to codons
i think they just mean that certain genes that would be found on one autosome usually are suddenly in a different chromosome
which is known to happen, but it's usually deleterious
<a:aWackySmushy:394353102381383680>
<@!184545248930693120> i'm actually sufficiently impressed with this burger

there's a blind spot on the wraith where you're right next to the driver's seat but the prompt to enter the vehicle doesn't show up, you have to crouch in that and hold the button down as you kill the driver, then you'll immediately get in

why
holy _shit_
<@!207991389613457408> this new skull is kind of fun
it's not noclip but fairly close
you hold the jump button and you zoom until you hit a wall or invisible barrier
it seems there's a lot of invisible barriers too, unfortunately, and i'm not sure if they added those just for the skull or if they always existed
ah HAH
yes, the barriers were all included in halo 3 when it originally came out, for SOME REASON
oh shit actually you know what, it's probably for the mode where you can review footage from a game
but you know what that means? the old gaps in the barrier still exist too
so i'm able to fly out of this map as soon as i find a gap anywhere, and so i HAVE

holy shit, why is chief doing this shit
he looks like he has brain damage and that fucking AI lady is the only thing keeping him tethered to this reality
yeah, tarantino is really good at creating tension
pretty impressive shit
they're pretty intense
he's a pretty controversial film director
for good reason, i'd say, though the debate is murky somewhat because he's also just kind of a terrible person
very rude and egotistical
WHY ALL THE NEED FOR THIS GRUESOME, GRAPHIC VIOLENCE
woc, just because he's a film auteur doesn't mean he isn't also controversial, get your head out of your ass
he is controversial, what do you want
some people don't think that his subject material is appropriate or decent
i think his movies are genius
but far be it from me to say that he does not suffer any sort of controversy just because i like his movies
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm not sure about that one chief
tarantino also has a pronounced foot fetish
that's disgusting
i want you to watch a single tarantino movie and tell me that man does not put his bologna on some prostitute's dirty soles whenever he gets the chance
i was going to say, i think there's something with uma thurman but i can't recall
it's been a few years since i watched that one
we should have a marathon of tarantino's movies and make an exhaustive list of the feet exhibitionism
truly this is an abhorrent gap in artistic literature
feet fetishists are fine, leave them alone
yeah i don't know how much i agree with that
like, the notion of it being less transmissible for diseases by not having mucous membranes kind of makes sense? but that seems more like a postulation and not a solidly supported conclusion
because there are other parts of the body that are more commonly seen/used and also do not have mucous membranes
like the palms of one's hands
hell the fuck no
if you ask me that question ag--who is this? i should kick your fucking ass!

DON'T
ANSWER
i've always felt weird that it's called grass type instead of plant
like, how
i feel like being chubby has been politicized in its own way
it should be obvious that most instances of being overweight are not healthy and should be kind of discouraged
but it seems at every turn i encounter people who bring up the explanation of "some people literally can't control it due to health problems and this and that and yada yada"
like yes, i know this
it was literally part of my curriculum
that's why i worry about people being overweight
yeah, i know
that's a problem
number one leading cause of death in america is cardiovascular disease, often aggravated by obesity
that too
either way, this is what i mean
i have to fight tooth and nail to express like bare bones basic ass science here
"being overweight is unhealthy" "FUCK YOU NO ONE CHOOSES TO BE OVERWEIGHT"
hoooo boy
<a:megababyvore:526984302907359232>
as time has gone by, increasingly i feel like _everything_ tensei says and does here is to illustrate this idea that nothing on the internet is of real importance or seriousness
which is interesting to me
i'm just musing at this point
i have both
anyway, tensei if it were just me i wouldn't mind so much, but clearly this is a sore spot
try not to push people's buttons so hard
like, i'm clinically obese and i think that being overweight is a complex issue that probably needs to be addressed somehow, but i don't have the werewithall or temperament to care that much
i think the more salient point here is that other people get fucking _pissed off_ whenever obesity is brought up, so it might be for the best to avoid that unless we want to engage in some kind of battle royale conversation
which is a battle as old as the internet really
i think the prevailing wisdom in this channel is "don't take anything here too seriously"
it's much easier on the heart that way

Well, I WANTED to watch the direct but I have to get going early, someone ping me about whatever disappointment they have this time
okay what did i miss with the direct
figured as much
sleep experiment probably never at this point
god, i feel myself taken by the urge to write stuff and pass some serious shade
i'm still lowkey hopping mad about everything to do with the official team
nothing new, i'm just reveling in the freedom of not having to hide everything at this point
i've made a comment a few times to the effect that our staff is more geographically, demographically, and ideologically diverse than the official team
and then i start thinking of other stuff
i don't know, i'm probably just ruminating too mcuh on it, this wouldn't make a good spat enttry
i'll leave what i've written up and come back to it later, probably delete it
yeah, precisely
i'm mad about it because the diversity point was brought up as evidence against us for some reason
like, a definite argument could be made for ideological diversity, because having dissenting viewpoints is important when trying to consider all angles
but demographic and geographic diversity are secondary to that and only matter in terms of how they affect ideological diversity
we're watching my ass
we're watching misfits misha stfu
watch as half of those votes for farscape is misha changing his IP address and voting multiple times
i mean, to be clear, i was saying it as a joke
i don't actually expect misha to be a son of a bitch
because it's basically glorified venting at this point tarty, or arguing against someone who's not even here to defend themselves
i feel better talking shit in here because ~~it's an echo chamber designed to make me feel better about myself~~ it's not just an empty room i'm screaming into, there are real people here who can help me figure out whether or not i'm being reasonable about these things
fuck, solipsism was right
i was going to agree with makin but upon thinking about it, they're all light criminals (i think) who accidentally contract superpower STDs and then are forced to kill their probation officer
that's not lighthearted, that's traumatic
also one of them is bolton ramsay so that's automatically pretty rough
4
also go apologize to that user right fucking now
you can't keep avoiding us, and if you haven't done it by the end of the day i'm demodding you
if you're _only_ not apologizing to this person because you're incapacitated due to work or health, then that's fine
but if you're just being obtuse i will come down on you with the force of a thousand suns
holy shit this is a trainwreck
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i think this argument is ridiculous personally
i get what misha is saying but it's also kind of asinine
yeah, this is the thing, is that i think everyone here agrees "this is bad and creepy bullshit" but now the official argument is "does this count as pedophilia or is it JUST creepy"
which is like complaining about being bit by poisonous snakes and then arguing with each other about whether or not they were rattlesnakes or cottonmouths
<:whocares:316003590462504981>
international shipping for homestuck merch has always been fucking terrible

i'm putting a tarp on the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
YOU HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE TARP FFFFFFFFFABRIC HITS THE FUCKING EARTH
NOW GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY SIGHT BEFORE I PUT A TARP ON YOU TOO
that explains a lot lat
AND IT'S ALWAYS... ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEE YA
no
i'm putting my foot down
we are not going to ahve two concurrent streams of tv shows people want to watch
kamen rider is enough
look, i'm already tired of regular streams, okay
we have enough of them
YOU CAN'T STOP THE MISFITS
i don't know, misfits was a surprise hit
but you say that the bit doesn't ever change or improve
if that's the case then what you say might come to pas
in which case, sure
but we'll just have to wait and see
you underestimate how different people's tastes are
i was totally disinterested in fringe despite the fact that everyone was fucking bananas for it
votebomb dis dick
also yes there are
don't forget, i took a user census like last month
i literally did check
i had this whole thing
okay, what's your metric for being a regular
if your answer doesn't satisfy me i'm going to fly down to brazil and shove my foot so up your ass the water on my knee will quench your thirst
RELEASE THE ~~EMAILS~~ LIST OF REGULARS
it's hard to quantify lurkers for obvious reasons
i liked my approach to determining regulars much better
they're both arbitrary standards but misha's is fake and gay whilst mine is not
oh no i feel the opposite way
well, i guess that's true too, there would be people who don't talk here but do watch streams
but i think it's far more common that there are regulars here who don't watch streams, lmao
anyway, my method was to physically write down every single name that i saw talking in here for the span of like a couple weeks or a month
then after i had concluded my observations, i checked their message history in here
no i'm not done misha
shut up fool
this is what you get for interrupting
DON'T QUESITON ME
anyway, let me put it all in one message so i can't be interrupted by fucking br wieners
i wrote down every name i saw talk in here for about a month, after the month concluded i also determined their message count for that month, determined the total number of messages sent by the people i saw and figured out the average number of messages sent per user, then set a threshold for minimum messages sent whereby you were considered "a regular"
and you could adjust that threshold based on how rigorous you wanted to be about it
your method sounds even worse
i don't know why but that got me really good
but enough discourse, have at you!
that's a carryover from the previous administration, everyone knows the newest president inherits all the bad decisions of the previous one
<@!207991389613457408> you butchered the fuck out of that story
i'll read up on that in a bit
at any rate, we were going on this LOTRO tour as tarty described
i'm not sure how many of us were drunk but it was at least a few
someone asked who gimli's grandfather's name was specifically because they knew the answer was "groin"
so we chuckled about that but then somebody, i think dero, said "poop ballsack"
and that was funny too but we mostly let it alone for a while
then apropos of nothing it came back like an hour later, as we were finishing up that leg of the tour in the shire
"what's gimli's grandfather's name"
"poop ballsack"
and it just kept fucking going for no reason
eventually we're all laughing pretty hard, except for tera, who up until then had been saying nothing about the joke whatsoever
then all confused, in complete earnestness it says "wait, is that his real name???"
and that launched our fucking sides straight into the sun
i started laughing so hard that i literally could not breathe, and every scrap of air i got was immediately gone again
yeah, that's right
and most of us were laughing so hard that we kept choking and physically couldn't tell each other where to go
and tera in the midst of it all like "i don't get it, is that his real name or not?"
like it just didn't fucking know
man, that was a good night
dude, i live for moments like that
when i start laughing so hard that i physically can't stop and my fucking throat hurts for the rest of the day
we've had a couple of those recently
the latest one didn't quite hit it but was quite close, when that user came in to describe her story about her grandpappy in the mines and was talking about a donkey, then dero started making a stupid donkey impersonation
i still can't believe you couldn't tell whether that, in the most famous fantasy story ever written, the name of a dwarf's grandfather was NOT in fact "Poop Ballsack"
wait, what
thots gonna thot, as they say
unbearable pain
why on earth would they exercise design choices like this

is there any other fan game out there as ambitious and well-executed as mario's mystery meat
are you saying you fucked my mom

it came out like two months ago, it's a fan game for vinny "vinesauce" pizzapasta
astonishingly complex and well put together

wait
instead of the whole fucking thing, let me link the shortened one so you people with short attention spans won't ignore it

i can't believe how funny this is, despite being monstrously idiotic
jesus fucking christ, i have to stop
i keep expecting it to stop being funny but it just keeps going
my entire torso hurts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsO2QjbrUCA
was lowkey worried that i still had xkcgoatse in the pastebin
god, my fucking glottis hurts
this might in fact be the worst thing we've ever gotten our hands on
holy shit, this is just the night i needed after everything
my laughter quota for the week has been satisfied

this all reminds me of a story
i think i've told it in here before, but i'll tell it again
one time when i was younger, about 13 or 14 or so, i used 4chan a lot and had just started getting into "the deep web" after downloading tor for the first time
i went down a rabbithole of tor links and increasingly nested hidden websites, including some really interesting stuff like an extremely cloistered 4chan clone where every single person seemed to know each other, and then an entire virtual library of "forbidden books"
one of the links i found brought me to a webpage that claimed to host an archive for classified government files from across the globe, and came with a very imposing warning: "the contents of this website are disturbing, and may shock you so much that you suffer from PTSD for the rest of your life. do NOT click into the rest of the web if you value your sanity."
this was the first time i had ever run into anything like this, and i was kind of terrified
i wanted to know the deeper secrets of the world, and i spent literally a week psyching myself up to click in
finally i said "i'm going to do it, sanity be damned"
i loaded up tor, navigated to the same page i had looked at off and on for days
with my heart hammering in my chest and breathing quick i clicked the link to get further into the website
and i found myself staring directly at goatse
that was probably the hardest i have ever got got
oh no
pack it in this ass
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>

JUST KEEP GOING
i remember this commercial but i don't remember if it just played as a typical commercial on prime time
i think it was played at specific times
can't remember
shit was like 13 years ago
i mean, this isn't the weirdest part of halo 3's advertising deal by any means
halo 3 had fucking doritos and mountain dew parternership
i'm pretty sure that's how it became a meme
or did it go back to halo 2
somehow this shit was viewed as cool and exciting and not totally weird back in the day
like, looking back at this i'm not sure how it was possible that we got to that point
are there still partnershps like this
lmao
fucking MLG
BWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
he looks like andre the giant after being homeless for a few years
```... it intended to leverage the purchase as part of its plans to build an esports-focused television network. ```
hwo did this work out
lel
to be fair, when overwatch first came out that game looked like it was gonna be fuck huge
gained a lot of traction and support
but then they kept rolling out balancing changes that completely fucked everything up
speaking of, i need to play a bit of pokemon clover and the other stuff i was doing
la mulana 2
everyone wants me to play like ten things
fucking "Twilight Blossom" <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
good job nat i'm proud of you

i'll play more lobo corps tonight
i can't do it right now i think

i almost clicked on that lel
misha is DONE with telecommuting

oh yeah, speaking of brazil
i heard coronavirus was flaring up there too, is that still a thing or
it's definitely not on the level of the n-word but it doesn't have to be on that level to get censored
like "fag" gets censored as "f-slur" stuff like that
yeah, that sounds like a pointless exercise
"name a 3rd one" sounds kind of like a challenge
"uphold this convention"
oh yeah, i was even going to use that one even though we don't consider it a slur on this server
gypsy is just... it really depends on who you talk to i think
gypsy is more of a historical slur than a modern one if i'm not mistaken
<:tereziFuck:585539573539405868>
zent banned, god
let this be a lesson to all of you
it's spelled "gipped"
holy shit, tensei coming out with the _real_ conversation
also i was wrong, "gypped" is also a valid spelling
also also, "gypped" or "gipped" actually has nothing to do with gypsies, or at the very least that connection is heavily disputed
```gyp (v.)

also gip, "to cheat, swindle," 1889, American English, traditionally derived from Gypsy (n.). Gyp/gip/jip is attested from 1794 as university slang for a servant that waited on students in their halls. This is said to have been especially a Cambridge word, and a story told there derived it from Greek gyps "vulture," in reference to thievish habits of the servants. ```
is this the dumpster?? i feel like this is infinitely less contentious than shit like the n-word or anti-semitism
at worst this is like dumpster adjacent
<@!111477124384202752> just so you're informed, apparently the exonym "gypsy" actually comes from the middle english word "gypcian," which is sshort for "Egipcien," which is a reference to the fact that the romani were originally believed to be "itinerant Egyptians" as told in some bible story or another
the fact that "gyps" is the greek word for "vulture" is just an unfortunate coincidence
ARM YOURSELVES WITH KNOWLEDGE
jesus fucking christ <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i don't even know how pejorative that's considered but it just _sounds_ bad
yeah, what the hell are you talking about b3es
wheals is 100% correct
it means "stingy"
it's from old english
has nothing to do with the racial epithet at all besides sounding similar
i was fucking 14 when i first heard the phrase "giant turd versus douche sandwich"
no it's not
that was fucking 2004
or, wait
hold on
yeah

fuck yes
we finish the campaign tonight

you're a mothman
never even seen it, i kind of want to
especially now that i've been exposed to people saying it's not that great
i find that whenever people talk shit about something i'm vaguely interested in, it motivates me to watch it and i also enjoy it much more as a result of the heckling
when have i ever claimed to be fully rational
i try my best to be reasonable but i'm only human
if you want someone who has a stick up his ass about being rational, then look at makin not me
i think that's a really dumb way of saying that eva is stylistic
and i don't mean that it's stylistic visually, but moreso in its presentation
granted that i know nothing about this, i'm just steelmanning that idea
but also like
i just went to recheck what you said and you said _fans_ do that, and yeah totally
yeah lmao
alright on my way home

so like, upon becoming slayers, dwarves can NEVER reclaim their honor, right
how does that work if they keep slaying bigger and bigger shit and eventually become demon slayers
you'd think that being able to slay fucking demons would be a net gain on honor
White rum tastes like fucking shit
How was it
Oh come on
What was that one fancy ass alcohol that was basically liquid spronkles
Sprinkles* and I meant glitter
Fuck you misha, that got me good
"You ever heard of a Brown Elephant"
I can't start laughing at this right now I'm in public
Deviantart has given us such wonderful games as "find the sonic OC with the same name as yours"
Bulgec Hungus is a valid troll namd
I once played that game and Drew the Hedgehog just looked like a 40 year old loser sex pervert
That's the one
No, I _wish_ I had the genius to conceptualize that
i'm free tonight misha
let's pwn some noobs (lol)
wait, what's going on
are we talking about the emails again
i sometimes wonder how exactly we must look from the outside, to people who have literally no exposure to anything we're talking about
we probably look and sound like fucking aliens
oh yeah, how many episodes of cobra kai and/or misfits did we watch today
i was out taking care of Bullshit
hi i'm here to start banning the fuck out of people who are breaking rules
who's first
someone called down the wrath of the gods and we are here to smite a bitch
classic
what would people do if i turned off ignoreplebs in here for, oh, half an hour or so
DOWNWARD
SPIRAL
LET IT BE SO
DINGUS, WHY
they were already gone pretty sure
oh were they back
yeah just perma
feed the birds?
look, for three years i've only _documented_ the drama, i never actually went out of my way to create any
the last week or so is a departure from the ordinary
well that's stoopid
i somehow never got a death threat through discord, until last week
children don't count
i mean i don't take them as a serious threat to my health
obviously it's disturbing that kids would say shit like that but i don't expect a 9 year old to hunt me down and try to shoot me in the kidney
okay, let me clarify
i usually don't care that much about death threats, i received lots of them on tumblr and i'm pretty unphased at this point
i'm just pointing out that there's a certain age where people should know better than to give a death threat to someone else, and i'm primarily bothered by those people specifically because they have some kind of stunted mental growth probably
lmao, poor tera
yeah, mod chat has a couple of spicy keychains in there
fuck, i'm losing it
i would go through my DMs but most of them are actually kind of okay, and there's an absolute fucking shit ton of them
not lately though, i think people have been more hesitant to approach me since i became admin
which is nice, but i also miss interacting with people more generally
griever drew homestuck porn in general
oh yeah, that guy
that video always gets a good chuckle out of me
what the fuck
what is the context of that screencap lat
also i feel like i might want to stream pokemon clover soon, at least the beginning until i get to a part i have to grind at
<@!173936231229554688> you still wanted to be in on that or something?
lat, is this something i should be concerned about
like, i'm being serious
i played a bit of it the other day and didn't go past the opening, but even what little was there made me laugh
alright, that's all that matters lat
i don't need or want to know more
WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
yeah sure, i'll get it set up
yeah i commissioned him like twice
it was great, until it was fucking terrible
worse: union jack
i'm kidding, it was boring hetero stuff
also by fucking terrible i just mean the falling out
griever turned out to be a backstabbing asshole, that's all there is to say on the matter
anyway, i have pokemon clover up and ready to stream
i'm gonna take a fat piss and then i'll start
alright here we go <https://www.twitch.tv/drewlinki>
this
literally called a corkscrew
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
wizards 4 lyfe y'all
anyway pokemon clover hit a bit different than i expected
it's still really great quality wise but the humor isn't hitting me right most of the time
also definitely not appropriate for streaming, shit'll get me banned quick
corkscrew is both a type of shape and also a distinct object
like, things that descend or ascend in a spiral motion are said to be corkscrewing
i guess that's where the name comes from
yes, okay
i get it
you can shut the fuck up now
someone ban andrew
i am too hot and too tired to continue
i'm not surprised screw is from french
"ooh" and "ew" words just reek of french
yeah, was it deleted or something
i'd check the logs but i'm lazy and demand instant gratification
yeah, "x delenda est" is a reference to "carthago delenda est" which is a latin meme
"i believe carthage must be destroyed"
so fluff was basically saying "i believe tera must be destroyed"
i didn't get the impression it was meant in earnest though
like
i'll teach sonic not to mess with my style
REDDIT DELENDA EST
it's less funny when used directly after a fuck huge rant claiming we abuse children
that's the difference
yes
like, unironically
it was at the end of one of her twitter posts
a big fat "REDDIT DELENDA EST"
which, y'know, when talking about it in retrospect, that's the kind of dumb bullshit that you wonder why you ever took it seriously
the accusations were sufficiently bad on their own, i dont' know why she would attach a meme phrase to the end of it
kroger is great
their rewards program actually helped a lot
the next thing we should stream after we're done with misfits: the fleischer studios Popeye theatrical cartoons
but no in seriousness for some reason i have an insanely strong urge to watch through venture bros again
that show is, to use lame parlance, ultra kino
about 75 episodes, 20 minutes each
yeah, that's the only thing
is the first season feels really gritty
it's not nearly as much of a problem when rewatching it, but that first time through i really struggled to make it through to the second season
after that though, immediately takes off and continuously gets better
there's actually a decent amount of set up in the first season, a bunch of characters and settings that all come back through pretty much the entire show
<:orpheus:557797762670788620>
i'll look through the first season and see if there's anything that can be skipped
it's all pretty necessary though from what i remember
it started off as a really generic adult swim show, 2004
jesus christ
humor that was kind of snappy but not too clever
lmao, right, that one is completely pointless but genuinely funny
<:harold:423256024984846356>
it's really, really bad cy
i've watched venture bros like three times and the first season is always almost enough to make me quit
venture bros also doesn't have the name recognition that avatar does, so people probably aren't going to be as willing to sit through it as they were otherwise
yeah, i'm looking through the summaries now, and i think we could get away with that a few times
we might be able to find a summary on youtube or something that does it justice without wasting our time
but it's like, all of these fundamentally important characters are introduced here
there's also the twist at the end of season 1
||where dean and hank get fucking killed||
i think that's the part where i was like "whoa, maybe i actually need to watch this shit"
hold on
i've got an image from the 1st season, need one from the latest
yeah but the twist specifically is like a shocker
i mean, it doesn't really matter now because we're openly talking about the twist being shocking, so people who are aware of this conversation will be primed for it
no of course not, it's just part of the emotional rollercoaster
venture bros' appeal is in witnessing the evolution of all the different cast members, and becoming familiar with this really twisted, interconnected web of events and people
dude yeah, we were fucking psyched for that
for those unaware, venture bros is infamous for having extremely long gaps between seasons
like, multiple years
we decided to watch it randomly a couple years ago and right as we finished up season 7 was announced and we got to watch that too
incredible timing
well no wonder you're all gungho to ignore the first season
there are no good comparisons readily available from season 1 to season 7 so have this shitty thing i assembled taking way too much time to do it
brock's portrait is dark because that screenshot was taken in a night shot
mfw spiral thinks the art isn't that different
lmao
nah i've dropped it
i played it for an hour and was like "wow this is going to get me banned"
yes
and also looked at the map
also the humor isn't hitting quite like i expected
DELETE THAT
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T WATCHED THE SHOW
we're considering doing it for a stream
you made a big mistake mines
yes
<@!184545248930693120> you're literally wrong ||they only die at the very end of the season as a gaff, the clone stuff is explained at the start of season 2||
also i'm rewatching the first episode right now, and wow it is fucking _rough_
there are some aspects of it that are definitely amusing but overall this is not something we would consider doing in a group setting
yeah okay that clip is good
let me see what the first episode of season 2 starts off as
oh fuck, you know what we could do
we could spotlight episodes from season 1 later in the show once the stuff in them becomes relevant
yeah we definitely can't do season 1 straight through
it's just too rough
no, we're considering it for like a larger community stream
like, misfits or avatar level
wait, what the fuck
season 2 literally starts with a fucking montage of EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in the aftermath of season 1
i think we may actually be forced to do all of season 1, i think it's impossible to skip that part of the narrative <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
hold on i'm watching
lmao, okay
nost, here, let me DM you the first episode of the second season
whoever else was in our group stream of it, watch this shit for comparison
i'm just
there is way too much shit happening
it would be 100% incomprehensible
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i think we'll just have to grin and bear it through season 1 on the word of the people who have seen it already that it becomes fucking incredible later
we can consider season 1 of venture bros to be the "penguin sledding" part of the show
yeah i don't think we can skip season 1
people are just going to have to deal with it
no, i don't think we can woc
there's just too much
both of the people i've shown season 2 episode 1 are both like "yeah we need to watch season 1"
season 2 literally has just too much lore in it to not go chronologically
if we stream venture bros we're doing it right
what the fuck
why would you do that
holy shit, 23 has a fucking "Porkchop Sandwiches" shirt, i forgot about that
<@!674004995242328065> no advertising on this server
already taken care of
i'm excited for this rewatch but it won't happen for a while anyway
yeah that guy is a former service member, he posted about it on social media
not sure if he was marines or not but either way he's clearly tough as fucking nails
taking multiple shots from a baton and getting pepper sprayed in the face, walks away more or less calmly and flips both the birds
yeah, i know
it's just impressive he kept his composure
okay, you can go
huhuhuhuhuhu
<@!125433170047795200> you want to get together and beat the everloving shit out of each other with sticks
time for a new topic: how about trump putting unmarked federal agents in more cities and "proactively arresting" people
including portland, chicago, and kansas city
i'm referring to the fact that they're using unmarked vehicles to pull up in front of people, grab them, and pull them in
https://www.npr.org/2020/07/17/892277592/federal-officers-use-unmarked-vehicles-to-grab-protesters-in-portland
this feels like you're addressing entirely the wrong point
"this has been happening for 40 years"
"really?? that's even fucking worse"
treating it like it's commonplace may be the correct _interpretation_ but it's certainly not the correct _response_
also what is SCA exactly
ah, so like genuine medieval combat recreations
that could be interesting
i don't know, i kind of feel like learning something more practical
er
okay, clearly i don't know enough here
does it also do hand to hand stuff
holy fucking shit
those frontrunners are fucking dead dude
*people wildly swinging poleaxes and spears at each other, taking massive blows to the head and torso* "Yep."
that's some coldblooded shit
that reminds me, i was looking up the mongol invasions of japan and saw this passage
```The Japanese forces inexperienced with non-Japanese tactics found the Mongol army perplexing. The Yuan forces disembarked and advanced in a dense body protected by a screen of shields. They wielded their polearms in a tightly packed fashion with no space between them. As they advanced they also threw paper and iron casing bombs on occasion, frightening the Japanese horses and making them uncontrollable in battle. When the grandson of a Japanese commander shot an arrow to announce the beginning of battle, the Mongols burst out laughing.```
```    The commanding general kept his position on high ground, and directed the various detachments as need be with signals from hand-drums. But whenever the (Mongol) soldiers took to flight, they sent iron bomb-shells (tetsuho) flying against us, which made our side dizzy and confused. Our soldiers were frightened out of their wits by the thundering explosions; their eyes were blinded, their ears deafened, so that they could hardly distinguish east from west. According to our manner of fighting, we must first call out by name someone from the enemy ranks, and then attack in single combat. But they (the Mongols) took no notice at all of such conventions; they rushed forward all together in a mass, grappling with any individuals they could catch and killing them.
    ‚Äî‚ÄâHachiman Gudoukun```
thanks divine wind
```The Mongol invasions of Japan facilitated a change in the designs of Japanese swords. It turned out that the tachi that samurai had used until then had a thick and heavy blade, which was inconvenient to fight against a large number of enemies in close combat. Also, because tachi until then had been made with emphasis on hardness and lacked flexibility, it was easy to break or chip the blade, and it turned out to be difficult to regrind when the blade was chipped. In response to this, a new method of manufacturing Japanese swords was developed, and an innovative sword of the S≈çsh≈´ school was born. The sword of the S≈çsh≈´ school is thin and light, but flexible and sturdy, and it has a gentle curve and a sharp point, so it has an increased penetrating ability. The most famous swordsmith in the S≈çsh≈´ school is Masamune.```
I think cobra kai is messing with my sense of confrontation
I keep noticing little things that I take for granted in terms of avoiding minor discomfort or pain
And bizarrely, i think I'm getting irritated at myself for it?
<:Quiet:732864699779121162>
Well like, some of the stuff in the first season kind of landed
"How many of you have ever gotten punched in the face" for instance
I've never been in a real fight and the idea of that kind of confrontation actually kind of scares me
Although that's somewhat less because it's scary and more because I'm a big guy 4 u, I worry a lot about the possibility of seriously hurting other people
Getting punched does suck though
I dont know, is it better to have a group of people who experience less hardship but are less capable of handling adversity as a result, or is it better to make them endure hardship and become more resilient
i come in, sit down, relax for a second, look at the computer screen, see "we should just eat infants," sigh, turn off my computer, go to bed
i want my first kids, never
cy just wait for us to do it as a group you fucking gremlin
valid
i already get pestered by my family enough
someone mentioned wanting to sue their parents for giving birth to them
i sympathize with that thought a lot
you're quite a bit of nothing happening, aren't you
FUCKING GOTTEM
oh my god, the pilot is even worse
oh my god, enough
we are not talking about this
am i going to regret asking more about this tera
oh yeah halo
i'm good
let us go
<:ree:475542526791516170>
you all SICKEN ME
i could stand to do a couple rounds of that
not too long, if people are gonna ABANDON us i'll probably end up watching cobra kai season 2, i missed the first two episodes
there's always another day to FINISH THE FIGHT
<:reeeee:248154233352749056>
fair enough
<@!184545248930693120> there are a lot of reasons: the animation is of far lower quality, looking almost like really cheap/poor flash animation in most parts, but that's probably the most superficial complaint; the humor is also less refined, going for obvious pulls that don't really stand the test of time (this was over 15 years ago now so i kind of forgive this); the show at that point is hard to view as anything besides a johnny quest knockoff
all of these qualities are improved on drastically after the first season, even the terrible one-off jokes like molotov cocktease are brought back and then kind of fashioned into something deeper
i think it's that the show developed a more solid identity and spirit after they worked on it a bit
like, almost immediately the increase in quality is stark
felt the compulsion to watch bill wurtz's history of japan again out of nowhere
i am
saw this all of a sudden


<:SekiroWew:561620440204705793>
i sometimes forget that ashina was a real place
sure
like, full disclosure, i'm being hard on the first season's episodes because what comes after it is infinitely better
that's just how it is
but strictly speaking, the first season does still have some stuff going for it
it's just that where it's rough around the edges, it's _really_ rough
people scrape their hands holding it
mint is from venus
"what do you think of my newborn son, america"
"absolute pish"
that just _sounds_ dangerous
i'll have to try a kamikaze sometime
maybe i can pick up some triple sec tomorrow
a good time maker
how are you guys still talking about alcohol, this is amazing
what counts as a cocktail
i don't know shit about drinking, i just have the stuff i liked and stayed with for a while
screwdrivers are vodka and orange juice right
the first mixed drink i really started being able to enjoy was like cream soda and malibu, which was absolutely fucking foul
but the flavors complimented each other well
vodka and orange juice is way more refreshing while also not making me feel sick to my stomach though
i don't drink that much
not a lot of opportunities to do it socially
i try to restrict drinking to fucking about with friends, and that usually means playing games with peeps online
i got to hang out with some of my colleagues a couple times and drank, but it was never that heavy
hangouts were usually more casual than that, and sparse
we weren't good at socializing
or you know, it was probably just me
i don't enjoy going out very much
my idea of an ideal evening is sitting in a recliner and reading or playing video games
i fucking love staying in
yeah, i feel bad for everyone right now who is going stircrazy
not much about my daily routines have changed, but i can tell that people have been upset and it's only getting worse
but it was doubly serendipitous for a couple reasons
i was able to give my defense for my master's thesis online
and you know what the fun part is
my webcam is broken (true) so for fun i delivered my defense while sitting in my recliner, naked
no, probably not
i'm completely burnt out on academics right now
at least on a graduate level
i don't think i have the mental resilience for it
just dealing with my own existence is hard enough on its own, graduate programs are like torture and a half
god, i feel you
that entire last semester was just hell on earth
what is your thesis over btw
jesus christ i understood basically none of that
usually i have at least some meager idea of what stuff means but that's a totally different realm from anything i've touched
no of course the first part was fine
i don't even know what the hell e2ee is
ah
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that was what came to mind as well, but bP here is literally the expert of this circle so i was going to let them finish
i'm mildly envious, your master's work sounds way more relevant to this place than what i was doing
and here i was, sifting dirt
oh, yeah, of course
that's what happened to me basically
i feel as if graduate school was kind of left deliberately vague
whenever i asked what it was like i got weird non-answers and deflections
i'm starting to believe that's on purpose, because if anyone learned what graduate school is like before actually getting into it, you'd get like 90% less applicants
"come work on a research project that's very likely unrelated to what your major focus was in undergraduate school, and spend 50-60 hours a week for shit pay if you're not in fact PAYING US to still go to school, and also you're more than likely going to develop depression and anxiety as a result of your experiences here"
"do you enjoy being in a highly stratified and overly bureaucratic system that makes you want to tear your hair out by the roots because of its unnecessary complexity and backwards integration? neither do we!"
yes, same
which kind of hurts
because i did and still do the process of learning by itself
but graduate school fucking broke something inside of me i think
i did and still do appreciate* the process of learning
i just can't motivate myself to go and find more knowledge of my own volition most of the time
i became so tired of having to know stuff that i didn't want to read about that i think it's made it hard to inform myself about stuff i'm actually interested in
yep
in fairness to you, it's not much better trying to find a job with a master's degree right now
there are a couple places around here that i was supposed to be a shoe in for, basically
lots of contacts through the university i got my degree in
nothing is working out though
indeed
you know, i have to admit, i'm kind of glad i got my degree in something different
all of you fucking math and compsci nerds need someone else to keep you tethered to reality
it's coding hour
no i'm with tm here
i'd love to be able to discuss what it'd be like to live as an Animal and not some animal adjacent bullshit like being a furry
furries truly ruin everything
AN ORPHAN'S SOUL?
yeah, season 1 does have its moments
arbitrarily
NOOOOOOO YOU CAN'T DELINEATE THINGS WITH PRECISION AND ASSIGN RIGOROUS CLASSIFICATION TO THEM

haha empiricism machine go `peer review`
i stopped doing the "press hard on your eyeballs and hallucinate" thing when i was young, i heard it causes eye damage
i used to love doing it though, very interesting and helped to fall asleep actually
i think i'll try it again tonight a bit
i mean, if we could achieve immortality through enlightenment then i'm all for that
in the meantime though, i'll settle for space travel and 3D printing
so would i, but we have no guarantee that philosophy would actually be able to help us transcend space and time
the thing about pragmatism is making do with what you have
the great filter is just conjecture for a possibility we don't actually know that much about yet
space is BIG, so big that none of us can comprehend the size
even if the drake equation is right, i'm not surprised that we've seen basically nothing
i'll try when i finish this episode
oh shit i've heard of this
i used to see people talking about it on 4chan, and a few comments were talking about getting high off the fumes inside the ping pong balls
that always made me laugh
i don't remember the details lat, it was definitely bullshit though
almost like it's quackery
my favorite pseudo-science is homeopathy though
because the fundamental principle of it--substance "memory"-- works on the idea that a material will retain an impression of other things it's interacted with
and of course that's not wrong, obviously chemicals mingle and interact with each other
but in homeopathy, the implication is that those impressions get _stronger_ the more dilute the contact is
so let's say you take an eagle feather and dip it in water
that's said to be 1X concentrated
diluting it in more water 10 to 1 is said to be 10X concentrated, and is labeled as ten times stronger
and you can get up to ludicrously high "concentrations" to the point that, scientifically, it's nigh impossible that any molecule of the originally interacting material is still present in the new dilution
something like 1 quadrillionth of an atom present
it's absolutely fucking insane
YEAH
NO SHIT B3ES
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HOMEOPATHY IS COMPLETE BULLSHIT
```In homeopathy, homeopathic dilution (known by practitioners as "dynamisation" or "potentisation") is a process in which a substance is diluted with alcohol or distilled water and then vigorously shaken in a process called "succussion". Insoluble solids, such as quartz and oyster shell, are diluted by grinding them with lactose (trituration). The founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann (1755‚Äì1843) believed that the process of succussion activated the "vital energy" of the diluted substance,[1] and that successive dilutions increased the "potency" of the preparation, although other strands of homeopathy disagree.

The concept is pseudoscience because, at commonly used dilutions, no molecules of the original material are likely to remain.```
```In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher potency, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting.[4] The end product is often so diluted that it is indistinguishable from the dilutant (typically ethanol or pure water for liquids, milk sugar for insoluble solids).```
```Modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of "water memory", according to which water "remembers" the substances mixed in it, and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed. This concept is inconsistent with the current understanding of matter, and water memory has never been demonstrated to have any detectable effect, biological or otherwise. The claim often given to support "water memory" is that science does not fully understand water.```

what can't you fill with bosons
is he saying "fuck"
or is that "look"
i swear to god i can't hear anything but "fuck
alright, done catching up on cobra kai
time to press on my eyeballs and hallucinate vividly
i'm impressed with how close those visual representations in the paper were to what i just saw

the only one i didn't catch was the last one
ah yes, i did yark
i didn't look at the files yet though
me irl
j
i like the crack theory that linkybot is just a portal through which the universe speaks to us
where's the halo
nevermind found it
also i just want to chime in and say that irony has its place but i would also appreciate a bit more earnestness in literature
not everything has to be draped in cynicism
what in the fuck is this
no i know, i meant in the showcase
it was a sequence showing the production of mjolnir VI armor
completely ridiculous
now it seems actual gameplay
what in the actual fuck
hm
that's some super shotgun meat hook shit
this is open world
yeah
i'm not sure if i like this or not
i currently like it better than what i saw of halo 5
so that's something
it's not much b ut it's something
i think the grappling hook thing is growing on me a bit
yes, that's the biggest question in my mind
5 was inciting the other UNSC AI to rebel
and establishing the whatever
maybe the AI just fucked off somewhere else
and without the AI, the UNSC quickly got killed
that's what i'm getting out of it
okay, really, really not liking this exposition
this makes no god damn sense
i mean, we got to see gameplay and i thought it was kind of okay
IS IT ACTUALLY OPEN WORLD
I WAS HALF-JOKING
YEP
IT IS
IT'S FUCKING OPEN WORLD HALO
halo so far has been exclusively linear campaign level design
i'm actually not that opposed to an open world game of it because that's kind of what i was hoping 4 would be, with you traversing a section of the inside ofo nyx
i know how stupid that sounds in retrospect but still
i don't know what you mean by that
they weren't that open
they had vague arenas where you had room to maneuver around and fight in different ways
that's different from being "open"
anyway, that showcase was okay
it's definitely not great
but i have a small, quiet spark of hope
that halo infinite will not be total shit
i also want to point out that this halo almost certainly looks like it'll be open world, which is just fucking bizarre
i don't think it's retconned
we didn't get enough story to know whether that's the case
it's just a brute being weird and poetic
hey, you know what though
some of this stuff isn't remakes or unnecessary sequels
so even if it looks weird and dumb, at least they're trying new shit
props for that
"wiener fight: cockamamie deluxe"
SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN
it was at the very beginning
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
ANTS
yeah i actually kind of liked that trailer
EARLY ACCESS
wow, obsidian has a lot of irons in the fire
i like how his face fell as soon as he said the name of the world
"Ayora" <:annoyedpepe:347205142136881162>
there we go
THAT'S the shit i'm talking about
HERE AT NINJA THEORY
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
hm
not just the lighting but the fucking architecture
and texture
holy shit is this fable
This would drive me mad."
nevermind this isn't fable
WHAT
OKAY
GREAT
nice to know i called it
we just saw that one
also i hate these recaps
"exactly what we needed to see"
<:husk:624861915587543042>
this architecture looks like SHIT
IT'S SO GENERIC
this story better actually be fucking incredible
the more i think about it the more i'm really not convinced halo infinite will work
it looks like they're doing more of the interpersonal focus that 4 and 5 put way too much emphasis on
also yes, the game looks graphically flat as a pancake
open world
which, you know, i might be into that depending on how they do it
i don't know
i'm really, really scared it's going to suck dick
but maybe we'll all be surprised
maybe...
...
hm
four months away, right
we'll just have to see i guess
there's a lot of questions about it at this point
i don't think what we got is conclusive enough to say it'll be good or bad, it's just worrisome
will do now
jesus fucking christ i'm losing it
i didn't realize discord had started preventing people from posting NSFW-detected images
let me see if one of the images from this morning will post now
holy shit it works
based discord even though algorithmic detection still kind of sucks
just for fun
once i get done catching up on kamen rider i'm going to review the halo footage again
and pay as CLOSE attention as i can
i really want to make sure i'm not going with a kneejerk reaction
it feels like they swung too hard the other way and went from overly complicated design to kind of minimalized
or simplified
the textures are way more flat, which is the biggest thing that makes the textures look weird
i don't know, what i saw didn't piss me off or anything, i'm just kind of concerned
FUNKY
misha, i'm going to be completely honest with you
kamen rider doesn't viscerally excite me or hardcore capture my attention
BUT
it is fucking fun
there's so much about it that i'm just like "oh wow, that's delightful"
and i wanna be completely honest: my lack of excitement is probably my fault, not the show's
this is blatantly good in its way, i just have difficulty getting into live action stuff with these tropes and this kind of storyline
overly dramatic, exaggerative live action stuff has always made me feel kind of awkward and uncomfortable, i can't stand plays and operas for that reason
that all being said, i'm managing to enjoy myself anyway, so kamen rider is definitely doing something right
WAR GAMES
"whoops i guess that didn't matter"
seven years is the original lore, we literally looked this up a couple nights ago
I'LL CREATE A _THOUSAND_ CUTE GIRL AVATARS BEFORE I LET THIS FRANCHISE DIE
misha settle down coomer
shut up, we're moving on
makin: "who cares about halo?"
everyone: "FUCKING NORMIES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
misha when something he loves is insulted: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cahrzi0KggY
we regret coming to earth
HOORAH
i just figured out that halo wars 2 is included with the xbox game pass subscription i already have, so i'm going to go play that essentially for free once it downloads
and also finish kamen rider
that's the joke
oh man, the halo subreddit discussion thread for the demo is a fucking dumpster fire
i see half the comments talking about how the graphics are weird and the trailer as a whole is mildly underwhelming
and then the other half are fucking shitting their pants that people aren't in ecstasy over it
most of the people complaining are being calm, even though they're not really explaining their positions at all
i gotta say, as time passes the kind of comment that infuriates me most is "i like/dislike thing" with no explanation
that blue is like startling
why does it pop out so much
haven't we had this confrontation before
IT ALL COMES TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DOOOOOOOOOOWN
you know, i just feel like this demo has to be from weeks or even months ago, because there's so much in it that doesn't feel right
i'm looking at it again and the first phantom that shows up is jerky in its movements in the sky
well, maybe not
god, whatever the final game looks like, this demo looked really bad as a demo
like, this demo didn't sink my excitement for this game by any means, it's just... concerning
i'm _worried_ about this game
i want it to be good, desperately
the gunplay looks kind of fun, i assume that people describing "it's on piss easy difficulty and slowed down for demo purposes" are correct
if this is the actual pace it might not be so fun but still
pistol is disappointingly generic
but that's a nitpick
hm
i think the biggest problem with the demo/trailer is that we still have no solid idea of what the story is at all
we have a premise now, kind of
humans lost a war (?????) with the banished? somehow?
despite the fact that makes no sense based on our current understanding of the series
cyber demon forerunner <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
that's a great description
come on, don't be disingenuous
i never fucking played 5 but i still know it's plot fairly decently after watching a playthrough
it's dumb as shit but it's memorable enough
chief goes AWOL with the rest of red team spartan IIs to find cortana, locke is sent to cooperate with the arbiter and hunt him down, locke and chief fight each other on a colony world but chief escapes through a portal to a forerunner facility, locke then goes to assist the arbiter in defeating separatists on the elite homeworld because haley is a prisoner of the separatist leader jul m'dama and they need her in order to track down chief, meanwhile chief finds cortana, turns out she survived after meshing with some forerunner apparatus that functions like a galactic internet and she can control guardian structures and weapons now, rampancy takes hold and she convinces the other AIs to revolt
like i said, it's fucking _ridiculously_ dumb, but i remember literally all of that based on watching the campaign _one time_-- not even PLAYING it--like four years ago
you people are being dumb on purpose
i'm reading the synopsis now to see what i got wrong
it's blue team, not red team (sue me)
yeah i didn't remember as much of this as i would like, but i wasn't that far off
yeah, yeah, fine
my argument is inconsequential, we all agree that it fucking sucks anyway
don't click on that, WTC spoilers
+progress
come back to us wales
we don't know that yet
there has been no message
what the actual fuck <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that has nothing to do with the prompt
are you forgetting that ||companions are a real, quantifiable concept in WTC||
||mary and raven both count as companions because they have a connection to each other's soul, doris has no such connection as of the current update||
alright so you were just being stoopid
okay everyone back to talking about how nu-halo sucks
```Speaking about Cortana's fate in Halo 4, O'Connor stated that Halo 4's story was focused on the effect that Cortana's sacrifice and loss would have on the Master Chief.[33] He also noted that this effect would be reflected in Halo 5: Guardians, with a story that explores how the Master Chief copes with loss and past memories.```
remember kids, try not to fuck up the tone of your stories by changing them like this
that's what i meant
it's also not handled well so it has both things going against it
one night in bangkok turns a hard man humble
siam's gonna be the witness to the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
it's "fine" in a bad way, as in underwhelming
i'm not excited for the game at all
i also don't know or necessarily think it's going to be bad
but i'm _concerned_
yes, what misha said
this is a middle of the road "it doesn't look great but it also doesn't look like shit" demo
YES
THE FORGE COMMENT
that's fucking spot on
you know
yeah
i don't know, each new mainline game is a possible chance to resuscitate it
but at a certain point, we really need to let go of tired franchises
if halo just is impossible to resurrect, then it should be put to rest
well, in fairness, gears of war 5 was stellar
it's just kind of depressing
it's always depressing to see a property that was the pinnacle of some kind of ideal or trend just descend into mediocrity
<a:HyperNotLikeThis:520455961069223940>
that's the joke gitax
the hexagonal pillars confuse me
did we see those at any point on the halo rings before
wasn't it all ziggurats and shit
wait a fucking second, didn't we see hexagonal columns like that in 4
are you trolling right now
it's sangheili
lekgolo
unggoy, kigyar, sanshyuum, jirallnae (sp)
we know this shit, we care a lot about halo
too much
everything that is old ~~is new again~~ is a corpse that gets reanimated and then rots a little bit more until no one cares about it because its legacy is tarnished
FUNKY
the use of the ode to joy was cheesy as fuck and it kind of worked, i was greatly amused
pandora's tower development is great, i'm assuming it's gonna do a sick anime plot and the protags will try to stop it from fully forming, it'll be complete anyway, and then the protags have gotta nut up and defeat the bad guys despite this
i look forward to it greatly
they were just a couple of song writers
jesus fucking christ
this stuff with shatner is still going?
i can't tell from these screenshots, is shatner like actually fucking with them in a negative way or is this light-hearted ribbing
oh right i forgot that RLM put out an explanation of what's going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF28Zednl10
hoo boy
oh shit lmao, apparently shatner actually did block RLM and that wasn't a joke, i wonder if i just forgot that
i don't know, if shatner is actually trying to dig into RLM like this then it's not actually based, it's kind of embarrassing
this explanation of the shatner RLM drama is fucking mystifying
i should never describe the internet as a tool for enhanced communication ever again
between hussie and this, i'm kind of stunned how easy it is for people to talk pretty much directly to one another and still be on absurdly different pages
i can't _quite_ tell but i don't think that's him on the verge of crying
i'm sure he's genuinely sad but he's mostly cracking a joke
finally
punished mike
really though, 2020 feels like our universe split off and is descending into ultimate madness
bwee?
who wanted to break into show business
WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
what all events do they have this year
i think what magistrate was saying is that most change is accomplished _within_ the system through legal _changes_
obviously the notion of what's legal and correct has changed as time goes by
yeah that's also what i was saying
magistrate is just saying that calling for a full-fledged revolution is not where we're at right now
consider that the confederacy basically tried to call for their own revolution and secede from the union
this all being said, i think that we're at the point where protesting is not just valid, it's practically necessary
yeah i'm not sure i agree with that jamie
you're making the supposition that when the slaughter comes, they'll continue doing the same thing that they do now
people aren't actually sheep, and suggesting they are is disingenuous
i think it's arguable that people are better at protesting now than ever before thanks to tools that improve communication and help people to learn techniques of resistance
if it comes to active suppression by legal authorities, i imagine that plenty of people will adapt to that development
a lot of people will die at first, don't get me wrong, but give them some credit for getting out there and having the spirit of resistance in the first place
i don't actually know how many people in total are participating in these protests
i would like to believe that it's upwards of a million
but is there ANY sort of data about this
god damn it
i shouldn't have been playing halo wars 2 you people can't stop arguing for 3 seconds
i'm like the teacher who tells students to read a book in class so i can play emulators on the school computers
i think class is The Most Important Factor in determining a lot of ancillary things, but race is also important
no, i'm serious
it becomes easier to handle a lot of other things if you have basic financial security
people who can afford food and housing and otherwise take care of themselves will be much better equipped to handle other systemic problems in their lives
the problem then is determining how things are interrelated with each other
because saying "class is the most important factor" kind of skips over the fact that race impacts class due to recurrent systemic problems that have been in place for centuries
tl;dr you're ALL wrong
i was just ejaculating my opinion for a bit, what's the harm
someone
LITERALLY
asked me for my opinion
even if it was a joke
<@!125433170047795200> REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE  I'M WOC AND I LOVE DRINKING AND SHITTING IN MY OWN MOUTH REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE REE
i'm sorry i just made myself laugh with how ridiculously stupid that was
yeah i know, i'm problematic
you send me various things at various times, refresh my memory
no i didn't see that
the worst bathroom i've ever been to was probably this gas station off the highway somewhere in lower kentucky
it wasn't even inside the gas station, it was around the back, which is how you know it's good
i walked inside and every square inch of wall, floor, and parts of the ceiling were covered in graffiti
i didn't even walk in at first, i was just stuck marveling at it
there was a little wall-mounted dispenser where you could buy novelty condoms, also grafittied, but surprisingly well-stocked
after i decided i would in fact piss there, i closed the door and discovered that its only graffiti was an enormous, spraypainted dick and nothing else
to this day i wish i had taken pictures, it was kind of magnificent in its depravity
THAT'S RIGHT WE'LL FUCK YOUR WIFE
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
all of a sudden i don't like this conversation
to be honest i have similar stories but they're not bizarre or tangentially amusing, just depressing
your god has made a world full of liberals
your god has made a world full of urine and feces
your god is a black lesbian toilet
this would drive me mad.
alright that's enough
andrew you need to learn to stop sharing stuff like this
you went too far
we don't need to hear about your family's bowel situation
yes we got the message
you can stop now
don't do it again
i'm just playing big bill hell's cars over and over again, so i have it tuned out, but it faded back into my brain space for just a split second so i heard "Thieves!" and i fucking lost it
oh hey quality music
phonetics are weird spiral
that sound can be depicted in a number of ways
is it time
i feel like we should watch something right now
how about... brave little toaster to the rescue
that movie is a fever dream, let's do it
who's up for an impromptu movie night
i'm gonna throw up the cytube and if we get enough people in there to watch, say 10 or so, i'll start it up
<https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight>

she'll probably love it
you are weak
and gods must be strong
terrible nonsense
reminder that we're watching brave little toaster to the rescue
join us if you want to experience madness
i believe someone on /r/wallstreetbets actually predicted this
i kind of wish i had placed a put on intel back when he suggested
fucking due diligence posts
tfw your computer has an orgasm induced by "an expert" over the information super highway
fucking lmao
this is why i love the internet
i forgot what it was like to have meme edits happen within minutes or hours of source material getting released
<@&693935623966425219> we finished to the rescue, "goes to mars" is next and if we get anyone interested we'll probably watch it tonight too, or we can wait until tomorrow night
it's up to YOU
actually we'll just do it tomorrow, but make sure you're around at like 8 PM EST for goes to mars
this is a warning
i'm glad i was able to share this movie with you fine folks
i don't remember goes to mars hardly at all
so i have no idea if it'll be more or less entertaining
either way, we're doing it at 8 PM EST tomorrow, clear your schedule or else

i'm playing a VN that misha recommended to me
higurashi
i'm still really early in it
i'm having a hard time staying motivated to read it, but i promised him i'd do it
no, it's about a tiny rural village where a young boy moves in and is inducted into this group of friends that have a "club" where they play games and inflict horrible punishments on each other
also colonel sanders is in it
ah, so i've gotten farther than you
i'm on chapter 7
say it right now in this chat
i double dog dare you motherfucker
oh okay so i'm nowhere even close
oh man
i already don't care much for the pacing
i take it 3 and 4 get better though?
i'm not gonna lie, i fucking hate the like sudden clash of sound effects when the story reveals shocking information to you
it's an aural jumpscare and it pisses me off badly
the scene right now is just complete blackness while the story exposits itself all over my face
if there's like scary images or character art in this i'm not going to be pleased
reeeeee
i'm a weenie okay
i openly admit it
i don't like scary shit
also tera you and spiral fucking missed out hard
i had just watched this some months ago and i still had forgotten most of the insane shit
if you want to watch it i still have the link
for andrew too since he missed the stream
you guys want some brave little toaster? i say as i dangle a vial of electronic parts from out of an alley way
so do you want the link to watch the movie or not
anyway we're doing goes to mars tomorrow night at 8 PM EST so don't miss it
or else
lat, it's been interesting and kind of fun having you in lit more extensively for the last week or so
has your opinion of this place and the people in it changed at all in that time or do you still think we're a bunch of stuck up morons
~~i don't even know if that's how you felt in the first place~~
nice
i see
it's amazing how impactful first impressions are
14-15 was around the first time i stepped into a chat ever, actually
if that had gone poorly then i probably wouldn't be here, that was a pretty formative experience
i know i'm going to sound like a boomer for saying so but that is probably just way too young to be participating in online chatrooms with people
14
in complete fairness i had been talking on various forum-like websites for about 4 years prior
god, same dude
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> got me there
dude i was fucking terrible
not because i didn't care, i just didn't know any better
i took the social version of a lot of hard knocks to get to the ultra diplomat who types before you
the drew hitler edits were not only fine, they were huge hits
you know nothing
sehkmaenzo loved the shit out of those and i singlehandedly almost won our team that forum battle with those
it doesn't help that two of our four-man team were completely gone during our match
pathetic nonsense
nat, i WAS exposed to kinning, although no one called it back then
in the circles i hung out in, it was called "being fucking stupid"
and then later it was tulpa shit
maybe i'm underestimating just how different the internet's landscape is now
i have no idea what kinds of stuff people get exposed to when they're finding their way around
back in MY day it was exclusively small-sized communities that were often in a forum structure
though 4chan was increasingly huge as time went by
i was going to say bP, if you actually got answers from some of them then that's cool as hell
yeah no that's great
there's a difference between someone letting you in on their work a bit and letting you contribute versus someone who manipulates you into doing their work for them
my dad introduced me to a physicist he used to work for and i helped them do some microscopy one day so i could get some experience with complicated tech and learn something
not the same thing as being a graduate student where your time and energy are sucked out of you by force
i shaved every day until i was 20 or so
```"I've just been informed that the sample is ready, Drew. It should be coming up to you any moment now. Look to the delivery system for your specimen."```
since this topic has fallen into kind of a lull, i want to bring something to your attention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFh2i4AlPD4&feature=youtu.be
is it just me or does this look ten times better than the demo did
https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/hwnxh7/gameplay_trailer_and_demo_seem_to_show_different/
apparently the demo was on an older build while the gameplay trailer is on a far more recent version
i also like the way this banished guy is presented MUCH more in this than it was in the demo
presentation really changes everything, huh
"I don't caaaaare" anyone who makes arguments like this should get temp-banned for like a day
i think we've gone over this before
not like, you and me, but the channel in general
if your contribution is "i don't care" or "who cares" then don't speak up at all
honestly yeah that would almost be better
still annoying as shit but less useless
because makin wanted it back when he still owned the server
i forced him to add <:icare:339529145065144323> to complement it
unfortunately, this server is inextricably connected to homestuck and to a lesser extent hussie's other works
for all we can tell homestuck 2 is already dead, and if this turns out to be the case there isn't much we can do
i mean i don't actually mind that much aside from having to explain the deal
it's a problem that crops up occasionally, i'm not gonna be angery
yeah basically solar
they might surprise us
i mean, not that it matters, because homestuck 2 hasn't increased in quality at all since it started and we're almost a fucking _year_ into it
man, remember when our biggest beef was with people from a tiny homestuck server and not, y'know, the fucking creator of the property
wow
<a:blinkingwhiteguy:473228468797046784>
yeah that kind of took me off guard
Coronavirus!John
Antimasker!Karkat
since when does a character having defined personality traits and emotive reasoning get in the way of making absolutely stupid headcanons or alt versions of them
a homestuck AU with no vriska would be really short because she causes  almost every problem
it'd get resolved in like two chapters
yes, kate is gone, so continuing to shit on her is unnecessary
let her name go unspoken forever more unless truly relevant
kate has only been gone for like a couple weeks
why am i not surprised by this information lat
bah
i am not surprised one iota that she's continuing to talk shit, just let her fester in her habits
who cares...
isn't hypocrisy fun b3es
i only brought up the death threats thing like yesterday, didn't mention it in the emails or spat
probably still has people bringing information to her, whether she wants them to or not
honestly, i'm amazed how exhausting homestuck is
i have felt many, many times over the last few months that no one should expend their energy on this
i used to be baffled that the drama could ever get this bad, but after recent events it's not as surprising
unhand her dan backslide
random emote servers are wild dude
<a:shaggy:423637406231560192>
woc, i think that's one of the emotes we banned
<a:DanceDog:729602019215671316>
yeah but he's literally spanking an anime girl's ass
get rid of it
what the FUCK HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU TONIGHT
KNOCK IT OFF
if you post another one i'm channel banning you until you stop being a dumbass
i'm okay with that one because it's absurd and thus funny
your life is spared for now
it's a badger
WOC
WHAT THE HELL HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU
LOOK IN THE FUCKING REFLECTION OF HER GLASSES
<:FeelsRageMan:358718007662608394>
this is giving me fucking heartburn
i need some absinthe for this shit
pathetic
i don't drink regularly god damn it
i hadn't gotten drunk for like two months and then had some white rum/wine earlier this week
you people are fucking ridiculous
oh yeah i forgot about that
anyway it's still not regularly
getting drunk a few times over the span of a couple of months is fine
i'm acting aggressively because this concern has been voiced before and it's mildly annoying because it's unwarranted
how the fuck is it concerning, i casually drink once in the span of a couple weeks on average
also obligatory `he is NOT fat. he is just big BWEBWBEOBWEBWBE`
<:annoyedpepe:430065054260658177>
b3es, for fuck's sake
just for that, as soon as i get back from taking care of my grandma in a few days, i'm making kamikazes
and we're playing halo
that vermouth was honestly fucking terrible
no wonder it's meant to be taken with something sweet
disappointment
CUT THE CRAPROW ROW
you a better man than me e e
e~
quality emote
yeah, that's practically stirring shit by itself
like, let them carry information to her
she's not our problem anymore
strictly speaking i'm not surprised that people are still talking about her in here, in the sense that she was responsible for stirring up an absolutely fucking monstrous amount of drama during her tenure as part of the team
it's still annoying but i can't be that mad about it
i hope people get it out of their system sooner rather than later so we can just move on and begin to forget about her
no, that's stupid
qweq you're being just as weird about this as the people who won't let go
people should be free to talk about it as long as they're not being creepy
it's not a matter of how many times you've espoused your idea, you're just advocating for punishing people who might not be doing anything wrong by itself
i don't like your suggestion of outright banning people for talking about kate _at all_
it's inappropriate
yeah well you are a wiener, so there
yeah i don't give a shit about the optics
optics are secondary to what's right and wrong
it's right to stop people from being obsessive and creepy, and talking about other people in a threatening or demeaning manner
it's wrong to stop people from discussing a topic in a way that is constructive or informative
well, strictly the emails were exactly one week ago
but otherwise i agree, you're being weirdly eager about shutting down conversation about this
wait, what
pensive?
pensive means like thinking deeply or reflecting on stuff
you're being vague, so it's hard to tell exactly what you mean
experiencing things is also hard so no judgments here
quick to make negative judgments
POWERTHIRST
MORE ENERGY THAN YOUR BODY HAS ROOM FOR
i don't know qweq, i don't have much to say on it
i've already said basically everything i can lately
"Why, God, why have you forsaken me?"
"CAN IT"
no, that's excellent
also qweq, if something is really bothering you, it's okay to want to try and hash it out
stuff's complicated is all
i think reasonable people are okay with trying to entertain that sort of thing though
yeah, i get yo
i just feel like some of the upset is warranted
we got severely mistreated and then summarily dismissed when we tried to bring it up
that's like the cliff notes version of the cliff notes version, the full explanation is fucking horrifying
people are gonna be angry about that shit, i certainly was
you just need to let them process it, as unfortunate as that is
oh, i don't remember this
also like, right now? no tensei
i had some white rum and then wine earlier this week but that's about it
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> nice
kml,
buh
yeah no that's a lot of work
i might do it some other time but i've got other stuff
i'd play that
unbelievable nonsense
you vape
woc post pulp cat
thanks
pulp kitten is just wonderful
how haven't we taken you out back behind the shed yet
no don't take my cheeseburger
that's dero's card
is nepotism not a thing in magic the gathering
no planewalkers that have friends or family that get on cards
SHUT UP

<@&693935623966425219> don't forget, brave little toaster goes to mars in an hour
i hope you all are ready because i'll kick your ass if you're not
oh wait no we're actually supposed to start now <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i forgot i'm not in EST anymore
anyway we will start in an hour or so because i'm a lazy fuck
and also to give people warning
tera, did you have a stroke while typing that sentence out
also no, you don't have to have seen any of the other films
strictly there's an order, brave little toaster -> to the rescue -> goes to mars
but they're basically independent
also stop playing shoot games, this i worth it
schuut
to be honest, to the rescue was a known element for me at this point so i wasn't concerned about how it would play
i have not seen goes to mars since i was like 12 though
so i'm not sure if it'll be more or less entertaining
if you want an example from to the rescue though, here's the song of the night: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB7KjE1XRw8
i think carl means in thsi channel specifically
yeah
the server as a whole has almost 34 million messages
ugh, i keep forgetting to do that, and now i'm away from my desktop again
remind me on... uh...
sunday evening, or monday
monopoopoppop
can i help you
i'll be in the ground, cold and dead
grond
nah
we're starting at the turn of the hour
get everyone from yesterday and make sure they know
i hate stragglers
üî™
i'm genuinely excited to see what goes to mars is like after all this time
i hope it doesn't suck dick
the first one is just Brave Little Toaster
and is far more artistically worthwhile than the sequels
to the rescue and goes to mars are basically glorified cash grabs
they also happen to be glorious clusterfucks
i genuinely can't remember hardly anything
what andrew no
you stupid fuck
do that on your own time, we're literally about to start goes to mars here
<:reeeee:248154233352749056>
people being uncoordinated
i will KILL
no
we streamed the second one
everyone and their dead great grandma has seen the original
i have a link to the first one if you want to watch it
i guess if you really ant to you can just do the first and second ones and not watch goes to mars with us
five minutes
prepare yourselves
i didn't even describe what it's like taking care of my grandma yet
wait until i populate the bot with _that_
thanks nik, that's actually what i was thinking when i typed ito ut
<@&693935623966425219> <https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight> alright get in here, we're gonna do brave little toaster goes to mars in like 3 minutes or whenever we have 10+ people, whichever comes first
<@!131650004606648320> <@!207991389613457408>
who else was here last night
i can't remember this shit
<@!266297207114825728>
bweeeeeeee
fuck my ASS
i ended up having to talk with family about shit and missed the last 30 minutes of the god damn movie
the party is tomorrow
i'm watching it anyway
"literally nothing happened"
you people have a weird notion of "nothing"
this fever dream just does not end
right before the election
i'm now in the freezer
and honestly this is fucking crazy
i love it
brave little toaster goes to mars
you should have seen the one before it woc, "to the rescue" was fucking absurd
i almost want to stream it again
the face of death
yeah, i have to agree
definitel still worth watching but to the rescue was just absolutely insane
interesting person kazuo
why yes
pretty sure that's ongoing isn't it
probably, but still worthwhile keeping it up
i mean, kind of vac
i think i was getting into it a bit too
do you like how we moved past it completely the next time we got back to that part of the story
YES YES YES YES YES
I CAN FIGHT, I CAN WIN
I. CAN. DO THIS!!!
lmao, i didn't realize that WASN'T the original line
got a video
<a:kermitnod:440188350058594324>
man, fuck musk
can he just get us to mars already so i can stop being invested in his progress
is okay
you get enough rest?
yeah, what nost said
comparing musk to yanderedev is disingenuous because, unlike yanderedev, musk actually knows how to accomplish something
they both fucking suck as people, but musk has undeniably made groundbreaking improvements in rocketry
i don't know about the tesla stuff, but landing rocket boosters was seen as a lunatic's task before he actually went and did it
like, literally the stuff of science fiction
i think gnawms is baiting you
yikes
what even happened with the amos6
like, how did the rocket fail precisely
was it preventable
i feel like musk is the modern carnegie or whatever innovator you want to slap in there
fucking terrible person, but history will look back on them as indisputably important in terms of playing a hand in the development of human society
that's just how progress seems to be i guess, usually the most industrious/productive person who fills a niche is also an insane asshole
that is quite a spectrum
on one hand you have rapid, incredible development in technology, and on the other you have child molestation
jesus dick
brb
well, i just used a mouse trap and caught a mouse for the first time
that was frightening
field mouse
there's a metric shit ton of them around here
i feel kind of bad about it
poor guy just wanted his peanut butter
it's some menacing looking thing that's kind of like a classical wooden mouse trap with the spring and bar that slams down
but this one is made of plastic and has spikes on it for no reason i can immediately tell
i didn't purchase it
yeah, i feel kind of bad for the thing, but they're fucking my grandparent's place up
i would have preferred a catch and release sort of deal but there's entirely too many of them and we really don't want them finding a way back in
honestly i'm kind of glad i'm moving in with my grandparents to help take care of them, they're not very good at keeping the place clean and orderly
it's not a one shot trap, it's resettable
har har
i don't know, killing things always feels bad, except for shit like ants or other bugs
if it's a chordate, i'm gonna feel at least vaguely guilty
pliskin? what the fuck is that
i have not done many things
name a thing
i probably have not done it
indeed i have not lived
great, time to go check out smooth mcgroove again
i like acapella stuff
there's something satisfying about hearing the human voice in harmony with itself
don't judge me
cuz if they don't sugarglass and if they don't sugarglass then they're no friends of mine
<:monkaS:547970951061438477>
who reported this and why
<:WaitWhat:357320862694637570>
oh dear i really hope that's not the actual reason this got reported, that'd be awful
carlarc is being facetious, ignore them
incorrect, nice try anyway
a patrician was a nobleman or aristocrat in roman society
calling people patricians or plebeians (commoners) is a meme
woc's here, quick, scatter
unfortunately yes
are you still trying cocktails and shit
fair enough
i'm still determined to try a kamikaze once i get done working for the weekend
i've never had a drink with lime juice in it because i'm a fucking wiener who doesn't try new things as much as i should
what the fuck does that mean
ah
nat you realize this is lit right
at least share the meme if you're gonna talk about it in here
why is achewood so god damn good
it is not a free weekend for me, i'm dying
hits too close to home
fuck graduate school
this is what is known as "old school"

did we not bother to announce sahcon again
sahcon is "stuck at home" con, which was started last year as a way for homestucks to have a convention event online since people are spread all over the globe
what's a shikaka
hsd members aren't banned
hsd staff might be a different matter, i'm sure i've been effectively blacklisted from just about everything
it's because makin's smarter and veils his censorship in the form of talking about corpulent canines
unironically yes, if you try to censor the topic by going "HOLY SHIT LOOK <:fatHusky:295293991438516228>" it will 100% work, even on people who are witnessing this exact conversation
except for carl probably
also dogs are in fact omnivores but carl was talking about me
i'm the corpulent omnivore
~~i probably wasn't going to participate in sahcon anyway so it effectively doesn't matter each way~~
not out of any active desire to avoid it, i'm just not a convention type
i used to go to conventions every once in a while explicitly so i could treat it as a mini-vacation: i stayed in the hotel room most of the time and went out to peoplewatch or go to the sales room
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> thanks for the encouragement qweq
i don't know shit about kiwifarms other than they discuss drama or something
is that where "lolcows" comes from
hm
that's terrible
that's a nice shirt
a cat in one hand, and a dog on the floor

i am, he won't leave me alone
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
pulchritude
been a long time coming
cartoon network predicted this years ago
this channel is for lots of things
would probably be easier to describe what it isn't for
1) murder
2) killing people for fun
3) here's a fact: dennis praeger should frighten you
holy _shit_
where are these leaks coming from
sm64 and oot/mm getting leaked are fucking _huge_
yeah, they're written in C
http://n64.icequake.net/doc/n64intro/kantan/step2/index1.html
fat iron on his hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip
what a strange time we live in
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> jesus
is that by design or is the leak just incomplete
i'm glad people are discussing the emails, more people knowing things and staying informed is always good
the dream of the windfish
what are we out of room
yeah i typically update when we're getting close to pin limit
or whenever i feel like it
l√±atest my cheeeee?
<:absolutelydisgusting:345034074815070208>
musk drama is honestly just bizarre
are he and grimes married
grimes just had musk's kid right
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i love it
whomst the fuck
yes woc do it right this instant
watch as the snyder cut is an entirely worse movie because it's a confusing, garbled mess
you have convinced me
this is absolutely delithful stuff
i kind of noticed that but didn't actually bother to look into it yet
thank you for linking this
i was always kind of fascinated with the text on that stuff but it was so blurry
hm
twilight princess introduced new hylian text with characters that correspond to the english alphabet
i forget if that stuff mapped to the old text or not
it seems not
that's a shame, would have been cool if nintendo had held on to this translation for no reason for like 20 years
coming to a gaemstop near yuou
i don't know what the context is so it's kind of hard to tell, but strictly speaking everything there is consistent
but just to clarify, is illumina referring to a spell or is it referring to the illumina myseq method of DNA sequencing
also holy fucking shit
people are going to put the zelda 64 beta together from these raw source files
jesus
jesus FUCKING christ
i have a story for you guys once misfits stream has concluded for today
well i'm not finding it very much at all today because i was basically kidnapped to celebrate my step-grandfather's birthday, and it was kind of absurd
but the first season i found more entertaining than i expected
i thought this was just going to be endless chav humor but there are parts of the show that are actually really well done and kind of emotionally evocative
oh yeah no the horny parts have been horrific, my midwestern WASP upbringing has made it impossible for me to endure overtly sexual material in a group setting
game of thrones was the same way
>:O
what, no
WASPs have different flavors but at the end of the day nobody wants them around
my god
tensei, you're right
in fact, i'm announcing a new streaming group: on saturday nights, we're going to start streaming softcore porno spoofs of popular movies
our first lineup consists of "Dawn of the Planet of the Gapes," "Game of Bones: Winter is Cumming" and "The Little Spermaid"
those are all real by the way
nathan is actually the worst shit head
OH MAN, TIPSY BRINGING OUT THE BIG GUNS
finally, i'm free
story time
yes, thank you for that, i'll take care of it later tonight
i'm gonna pull up your doc now so i don't forget
i'm also going to be drinking kamikazes so we'll see how that turns out
anyway, story time
so it's my step-grandfather's birthday at [undisclosed time] and they had the celebration today
i already don't enjoy large social gatherings and they had near a dozen people over
but i went out and mingled anyway, talked with people
then the birthday cake comes out, so we sing
everything's fine
i never know if people are going to do that shitty second verse, but someone strikes up
but the lyrics were different
"May the Lord bless you well"
and i was totally caught off guard by this
i have never heard that rendition before
but you know, whatever, that's not too bad
kind of kooky but whatever
i was already determined to tell you guys about that when i got back
later though, the dude was getting done unwrapping his gifts, and he started going on this little spiel
"you know, if i hadn't been born," he starts pointing at his children and grandchildren, "none of you would be here"
"my wife would have married someone else"
"just makes you think about the millions of aborted babies each year"
and at this point my fucking eyes shot open
"all those little infant souls, lost. think of how much different the world would be if they were here"
no, that's basically the story
what, did you want my dad's entire side of the family to start spewing racial slurs and sacrificing their kids abraham-style
you people ask for too much
you must temper your expectations
anyway i'm going out to get some triple sec and vodka
also gnawms i don't know dude, i have crazier stories but most of them are just kind of depressing
oh, i wonder if i've ever told you about that time i was playing truth or dare in high school
fuck it, it's been a while, i might as well recount this
my highschool was in the middle of nowhere, graduating class of less than 100 people
being in the country we also had a decent rate of teenage pregnancy
one of those was my friend, and we were all over at my place playing a customary game of truth or dare
pregnant friend got a dare to strip her top off and dance
she particularly liked those kinds of dares so she took to it with some vigor, but she was like 7 or 8 months pregnant at this point
so while she was doing so, she shook a little too much and sprayed milk all over everyone
truth or dare is just "fuck your friends by proxy" yes
anyway, that's one of my favorite stories, because with each passing year it feels a little more fucked up to think about
i want to hear them if they're funny/amusing mines, but let me go grab my alcohol first
and dinner
gonna burrito this shit up
woc, if this kamikaze isn't great, your ass is grass
what have i missed
what the fuck <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i was just getting the stuff, i haven't even begun
<@!119054275245506560> yeah motherfucker i went OUT to the store to get stuff
do you have like instant delivery groceries wherever you are
basically
<@!125433170047795200> holy _shit_
this is smooth in your mouth but then when it hits your belly it explodes
i'm fucking amazed
drink science is fucked, i tell you what
i'm just amazed how well the lime masks the ethanol
that citrus goes a long way though
fucking triple sec, unbelievable
yeah, i just needed to make this one colder
i didn't let the vodka cool enough before i mixed it, but i've got plenty leftover for later in the night
in the words of the immortal big beat mario, it's just one of those days
we should play halo or some shit
i can see why, this shit is borderline caustic
Wizard The
of course, lay it on us
wait a second what
how
ah, i see
that's a shame, but i was kind of afraid that would happen
he didn't seem like he was meshing too well, though i had hoped he would be able to overcome it
oh, the name change is because there's a lot of casual shooting the shit today
more than usual i think
we're hanging out
pull up a chair, get a drink
or for all you younguns under the legal age of drinking in your country of residence, get a spritzer or a sparkling grape juice or something
wizardofchaos'sstatementsdonotreflectthebeliefsandopinionsofHomestuckDiscordServerinwholeorinpart
oh, i haven't heard that one before mines
i've never heard of lapdances for graduation, but it was unspoken tradition in my area that seniors would do their last band performance naked inside their marching uniforms
they're like proto-frats
yeah, but think about how many sweaty teenagers have fulfilled that tradition before nik
those suits don't get washed
no, it was the honor system of course
i didn't participate, i was a pussy
i made up for it by defending my thesis naked
i wonder if anyone else has ever done that before
it's not staying, it's just for tonight
there's a lot of casual bullshittery so it's like why not
every time i look over at my tabs i see tera's writeup and my subconscious immediately leaps to "porn" for some reason
i mean, how many people were in your class
oh yeah, that's perfectly understandable then
my graduating class was a bit less than that and we didn't have very much stuff either
it felt like it sometimes because literally everyone knew each other
jesus christ this drink is like fire in my belly
oh yeah that's one of their better ones
holy shit
"The Tigris and the Euphrates" would be a fucking badass name for a drink
what would that be
it really depends on the people around you
but also i'm starting to understand a cardinal rule of socializing
the vast majority of the time, relationships you form in school tend not to last
which is bizarre because you'd think that would be less true the older you get
but i feel basically no attachment to anyone i met in graduate school, except for my colleague from egypt
that dude was fucking great
everyone else though? like, we just don't have any kind of lasting friendship
interestingly, some of my absolute best friendships have been with people online
yeah, yo ufucking said it linkybot
who changed this shit
<@!120187484863856640> SHAME
nah, strictly speaking he got cafe-lit in the divorce, so he can do whatever he wants with it
thank god
it's weird, but i just realized like yesterday or the day before how much more i can enjoy things now that i'm not actually a student
no that was actually a fantastic response
<:howlow2:676840417328889962>
<@!125433170047795200> i think i'm starting to better understand how much this drink is
so i've seen it before obviously, but i'm internalizing the fact that "one drink" is classed as 1.5 fluid ounces or 44 mL
i mixed one of those lime juice things
which is about 130 mL
so that's about 3 so far
and i'm already at a point that i would consider heavily tipsy
i'm fucking astounded how poerful this is
no, you don't understand
i haven't even gotten through it
i'm halfway through
this has been 1.5 drinks and i'm already getting decked
i can't believe this, honestly
in complete fairness i haven't eaten that much today so that isn't helping
and now i'm listening to the wall
what a night this is shaping out to be
what
wjat are you talking about
that sounds fucking terrible
this is the only content that involves nostalgia critic i'm aware of, and it's going to fucking stay that way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC8jaNnlP5g
imagine walking down a dark street at night and coming towards you is this
fuck you mint that got me going
holy shit
<@!125433170047795200> DUDE THIS DRINK IS FUCKING DANGEROUS
I'M NOT EVEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH ONE GLASS AND I'M ALREADY LIT
I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE IT
i swear to god i wasn't intending to get like this tonight
i'm jus
did you say you had _eight_ of these?
three of these are going to knock me flat on my ass
how are you not just dead at this point
fuck no
i haven't even seen the movie
i would want to watch that first
at this moment i relate most to a carnivorous plant because i want copious amounts of bbq
that's not true
most of what i drink is wine, and occasionally i get my hands on some vodka
this is the first time i'm having a Proper Mixed Drink besides a basic ass screwdriver
yeah i just got done with the three's worth i mixed
i'm not having anymore like i thought i would though, or else i would probably fucking die
actually you know what
maybe i'll go make some more
that shit was tasty
LOOK
MY BIRTHDAY IS SOON
LET ME LIVE
LET ME LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
mines trust me i love water like my own son
i'm drinking like a liter of it right now
i promise that i will not mix anymore until i have downed this huge thing of water and the vodka has cooled down to freezy freeze temperatures
mines, do you not enjoy drinking in general
then this is absolutely not for you
i just thought of the _name_ "kamikaze" for a second and it made me laugh ugly
woc, what have you done to me
you've probably fucking ruined me with this drink
i want to get a drink mixing set and practice
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
sssssssss\
\
i am having a good old time
wjere os tje gym leader on travolta idlsnad
excyuse ne
it is called "trovita island"
fuck this romhack
mo nboi
bio
no, it is "shiny gold sigma"
it is a bit rough in the later parts
look mines
i am not actually THAT SMASHED, although maybe kinda
it just makes me laugh okay
i'm fucking cackling it up in here
look at the shit this fucker sends me
also <@!125433170047795200> the thing that i failed to take into account was that the amount of alcohol would be ADDITIVE, not MULTIPLICATIVE
for some reason my literally autistic brain thought that 80 proof and 60 proof would be something like a 35% alcohol drink
THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS
proof is literally just twice alcohol percentage
that's literally all it is
i don't know why they bothered
i'm already slammed
do we want to watch a movie perhaps
we just watched the room like two weeks ago
this is my collection of movies on my burner google account for movies
some of those aren't movies

<@!146014279529791488>
here's baby.mp4 by the way, for all your reencoding needs

that lady is dead
it's sunday right
okay thanks, it's time for my medication
jesus christ
i'm fucking stunned m8
that's almost too spicy for this server
i'll look at that after i'm done listening to this track on the wall
fucking "nostalgia mango" took up the last twenty minutes and i didn't get very far
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
can be as easy as using a bathmat
excuse me
i had no idea that was your status
i mean, i don't care strictly speaking
i'm sure there's four thousand people in this server, literally, who have shitty statuses
we physically cannot police that
mother should i trust the government
what all is in no man's sky at this point
<:HYPERDANSGAME:549040689036525598>
WOULD YOU LIKE TO WATCH TV
excuse me what the fuck
yes, this is what i needed in my life right now
i forgot about "the pizza is aggressive"
JUST ANOTHER DAY IN THE LIFE OF JIMMY NUTRRUN
SHUT UP
STOP TALKING ABOUT FURRIES AND FURRY ADJACENT THINGS
i will not tolerate it
<:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
i'm pretty sure the percentage is higher than that
you're overcomplicating this
jagoff is just british accent jackoff
yeah, that sounds about right
also, i'm disappointing
wow
that is the fucking typo of the century
anyway, i was TRYING to say that i'm _disappointed_
as quickly as that drunkenness set in, it went away just as fast
more kamikazes inbound
but later
yeah, but probably not tonight
we've still got space
I'M TIRED, I'M WASTED
I LOVE YOU DARLING
yeah
i'm gonna have dinner alongside this next set of drinks
i'm sure it'll go better
i won't allow it
<@!168980988477702145> there's 20 fucking images in your article
i have to convert ALL of those to HTML
<:ree:475542526791516170>
how in the fuck did people work this out already
we really are going to have the zelda 64 beta
can't believe this shit
sure nik, i just imagine people sifting through this and patching this huge rom thing together
or a story, fair
yeah, it legit is
i never thought i'd actually get to see shit like this
nintendo's game development is a mystery and an enigma
so what exactly is this source code then
does nintendo just keep every little bit of documentation they have on the games they make
honestly, this beta test reminds me a little bit of the forest in twilight princess
very big and open
round two begins
üç∏
i'm eating first though
you should have seen me earlier
it went through me like a bullet train
unironically actually, we now have the beta(s)
I'M THE MARIO
EAT YOUR ARMS, AND THEN AGAIN
GO ON GOGON GOGA DO THE MARIO
I AM GOD, AND THEN YOU KNOW
COME ON IT'S TIME TO GO EAT THE DARIO
DOODLE-OO DOOT DOO D-D *vomiting noises*
J-JUST LIKE THAT
DICK
aw man, dude got fucked really hard by this timing
this seems pretty extensive though
he looks like chad and gordon freeman had a baby
also apparently the community has named that one brute from the halo infinite demo "craig"
which i am endlessly pleased by
yes, good
aren't most romhacks and fangames pretty bad about preventing sequence breaking
headcanon: just before brute society blew themselves back to the stone age, one of the leaders involved in the fighting was a messianic figure named kaiser
planet of the apes reference
make it happen 343
sad days in the music world
to be fair, that is a really terrible opinion
i imagine that opinion author recounting this story in the future
"i got fired for writing an opinion piece, y'know"
"oh my god that's terrible, what happened??"
"that's the crazy part, it wasn't that big of a deal but then it blew up. all i said was kanye west is the best musician of all time"
and then the other person gets up and leaves, never speaks to them again
at least you're better than every snobby hipster fuck who tries to link me that one article by the spanish or french author saying "the fact that the beatles are considered one of the best rock bands of all time says how terrible rock is"
like, fuck you
you are a prick
yeah, that piece of shit
no, no, i have been linked that article no less than four times by various people over the years
i'm fine with overrated, i just wish people were better at explaining why they feel a particular way
it's one thing to say "this thing is highly popular but it actually suffers from x y and z problems," it's entirely another to say "thing is overrated" with literally no followup
if i had one bullet and i was in a room with hitler, stalin, and every single person who says "this is overrated" with no explanation, i would personally mine and melt down enough lead to shoot every single person who has ever said it
<:hyperrage:347504921576472590>
if i was in a room with baby hitler, holy shit where are my leftovers this is a travesty
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> jesus christ
play halo instead
oh shit that's a chuchu
or supposed to be
ironknack seems like a prototype for uh
the darknuts in twilight princess
dero come on, do that in <#161229082519011329>
we're TALKING here
you motherfucker
listen to me when i'm telling you to do shit
GET OUTTA HERE
god DAMN
this zelda 64 leak is easily the best inspiration i've had to write more eloze shit
what unbelievable timing
i'm not sure what people see in this guy
like, sometimes i get a glimpse of it
in the sense that he seems able to actually put aside his personal biases and experiences to ask other, often extremely popular or notable people some interesting questions
but most of the time he is a fucking dudebro to the utmost extreme and it's very offputting
terrible nonsense
inexcusable
precisely
there is only one taste that is right, and it is mine
the god you believe in is not only not good, that god is _cruel_
this is horrific, i demand you talk about something else
god, TERRIBLE
oh shit, dero, one time in high school i was getting ready to leave and noticed that an old scrollwheel zune had been dropped next to my car
i kept that shit for some reason, it's in my filing cabinet
still works
i'm keeping it for if the apocalypse happens
never
some fire happening here between the ipod and zune fans
this feels oddly reminiscent of the time where moonjail and i wanted to make an online museum for the kid from brooklyn
for anyone who might possibly be unaware https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG2JF0P4GFA
my favorite part is still that, the first time he says "quaaludes," he _immediately_ starts to shake more vigorously
indeed
neverending stoooooooryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
we need a revolution
we should watch mary poppins sometimes
how abopuit you die motherfucker
woc, let's be real
i've met you in person twice
if i decided to throw down with you, i would literally be able to seismic toss you
you would be fucked
accept your fate
it's like the opening of sekiro where isshin ashina is fighting that enormous general guy and fucks his ass up
dingus make that edit
i know you have the power
i'll pin it if he does
that's even better nevermind
yeah no, woc isn't a skeleton
he's just not as big as i am
that's all it comes down top
does someone here have that picture holy shit
FUCK yes, there it is
that joke is actually borne out of an ancient reference in my irl friend group
basically it's just an out of context meme in our group chat from like six years ago
i'm fucking amazed how big my beard was back then
we bought nothing in the halal section, it was literally just for the meme
also i'm 6'3 and 285 pounds
i also have a blackbelt
so i have no fighting experience but i know how to fucking punch a dude
hap ki do
basically
grappling the martial art let's go
tera you're taller than me but you're also a giant wimp let's face it
SUPER SAIYAN ASCENDED PAST A SUPER SAIYAN
OR JUST SUPER SAIYAN 2
and THIS
IS TO GO FURTHER BEYOND
and then i just deck tera in the face
oh yeah my bad
i let them do that and then i giggle and snort
how could i forget
iiiiiiiiiiiiiy iiiiiiiiy iiiiiiy iuyhjoiiikll:
<a:think_vibrate:423261268015841290>
speaking of headaches, i should probably get some more water
i'm finishing up my last drink for the night, which mathematically is the 9th kamikaze
yeah what the fuck
i was about to drop that shit on you
ooo is a marginally less stupid planet name than owo
wait, other way arond
i'm drunk, ignore me
woc demodded for insubordination
if he comments on how i have not in fact demodded him, i will actually demod him

i accidentally hit "send to printer" on the screenshot before i managed to copy it
god i can't stop listening to this utter trash https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPGB3TqIHVI
give me something better in this vein to listen to
jesus christ
alright, woc is on the shortlist to inherit the server now

mfw mod ass

god dammit i waso nly trying to post the one
woc help kamikazes are fucking me
THAT went out the windoww
it's frightening honestly
yes
i've had the equivalent of six in the last two hours
it feels like i'm on the verge of entering a new plane of existence
i didn't even know alcohol could make me feel this way
if i play my cards right, never
i know how to handle alcohol even when it has me in its steely grip
i just drink fucktons of water and i'm good in the morning
that's because you are weak
oh no i've definitely done that
three times during graduate school specifically
that's way more fun than i am when drunk
god, what a nightmare of a shitfuck 12 months it's been
holy shit it's llf
hey dude
i miss you
i am extremely drunk and listening to pink floyd
how about you
animals
i listened to the wall earlier
i haven't heard animals in a while
same for atom heart mother, i listened to taht a couple days ago
was pleasantly surprised with the overture
there's a napkin waving on my desk that i only see out of my peripheral vision every 15 minutes and i freak out thinking it's a spider
then i realize it's a napkin and i get pissed
<@!125433170047795200> you wanna meet up and just beat the absolute shit out of each other
death comes
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
how will gnawms ever recover from this
wait, what the fuc
why has that image been labeled aghanim
you guys realize that's a boss from link to the past right
shut the fuck uop
shut the fuck up
shut the fuck up
if you say one more word you're banned
demodded
bhanned
THAT'S IT
GOOD BYE
CHAOS REIGNS
but yeah sure

go sicko mode, who cares
tera what the fuck am i looking at
this is satanic
you're going to loose subscriber
yeah, i'm sorry
i'm literally incapable of handling shit right now
i just got finished with my 9th drink of kamikaze and i am almost certain i'm going to be near death tomorrow
i'm a big guy for you
i don't mean that in a baneposting way i just mean i'm a gentle giant
i'll give you a big, strong hug irl if i see you and you will feel loved
that's a warning
CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRABBO

WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
<@!349796790360473601> who even are you, how did you have that image of me in the halal section back in 2017
did you change your username at some point
that's valid
are you serious
where did i link that particular shit
bear in mind i'm heavily intoxicated right now
ah, yes
palindox
i forgot she had that up
worth it
she's great

goodness knows what possessed her to do it but god damn
https://drewlinky.com/Alexa/bred/bred.php

jesus fucking christ
"it was meant to tell their fans to attack"
what a fucking cock
yeah what was up with that
i was just doing irl stuff today
you people are weird
so this is just the year where we learn that our heroes suck, huh
at least mark hamill is probably a decent human being
i wonder if mike had internalized that already or if this is serving as any kind of wake up call for him
shatner doesn't suffer from dementia does he
he isn't even consistent within the same fucking tweet
what is going on with him
PUTNAM
yeah, unfortunately you have a point
this isn't just being curmudgeonly though, if i had to say
it's like legit confusion
"HE MENTIONED US BACK IN MAY TO GET FANS TO ATTACK US (even though no one attacked us in may)
like, maybe he just really sucks at expressing what he wants to say
i don't know, i just feel bad for mike
shit really sucks
i know what happened because i was there
user5 basically spoke through skyplayer and decided to give someone at random 720 dollars
i don't like talking about user5 because he was banned and i don't really want him interacting iwth anyone here
like, he's not really THAT BAD if this is all he's going to do, the part that concerns me is that he might start doing something worse
yeah we banned him after he started being fucking deranged in my DMs, he was having some kind of breakdown and he said some shit i really didn't like, so we banned him
then he started saying he would rejoin this server with a ton of alts and basically said "i'm going to do this and you can do nothing to stop it. accept that, because it won't change either way"
i reported him to discord after that
tl;dr don't humor user5, ignore them if they reach out to you
i genuinely don't trust him to be here and interact with our users
i have no idea what it is he'd do, if anything, but i don't want to bother finding out either
so really, stop fucking talking about user5 and certainly don't give him an avenue back in here
anyone i find doing so is getting canned themselves
lat i genuinely do not want user5 anywhere near this community or the people in it
oh, no
i mean, whatever you want to do in your spare time out of this server is up to you
i don't want people to talk about user5
_in here_
you can still talk to him in DMs if you want, i can't stop that
i highly suggest against it because i worry about the influence he has on people
have fun with that
i'm done for a while after last night
it's not the worst night i've ever had either, i got plenty of water in so i was just kind of shaky this morning
my liver did overtime so i just needed to take it easy for a few hours
that number spam was the cat though, not me
i was talking about it a bit ago, did i miss something earlier in the day
i'm really disappointed in shatner really
it would be one thing if the claims he's making are true, but if you actually go and pay attention to what RLM is doing/saying about all this, it just makes shatner look fucking unhinged
i don't think it's a joke anymore
i thought so at first
now it's just kind of unsettling
what's the theory, that his social media manager is manufacturing all this drama?
i'm not sure how i feel about that
i guess objectively speaking it would be better than shatner himself doing all this and turning out to be a ginormous prick
yeah, RLM's direct engagement consists solely of saying "uh, this weird shit has been happening, this is what it is, this is why it's sad."
it's gross
dude this is totally ganon's castle, and not only that, there are elements of twilight princess's hyrule castle
this specific room
that raised dais at the end of the room? there's something designed almost exactly like that in hyrule castle twilight princess
yeah but we want to know with utmost finality
blurry text is a fuck
there's literally not enough pixels in here to figure out what this is
yeah sure, do it
<:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
who is this
yeah no it's pretty good
i like the outfit too
UNABLE TO COME UP WITH AN EXAMPLE
UNTHINKABLE FOLLY
i actually really liked that campaign
we just made fun of him a little too hard and he got pissed off and left
i don't remember, it was a while ago
oh wait, i do kind of remember
woc was talking about someone else and then i vagued about revlar since he had been doing his thing recently
revlar got megapissed about it, somewhat appropriately
i definitely didn't treat him with respect in that convo
... ???
every time i think about how negotiations ended i struggle not to become <:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
i'm currently flipping between the mindsets of "things could have gone so much better under different circumstances" and "well i'm kind of glad that we figured out this terrible bullshit sooner rather than later"
would kind of have sucked to get two years in or something and THEN learn what we were dealing with
ultimately, being too earnest and straightforward ended with us nearly being taken advantage of
poor bowman
hot take i don't really enjoy being the server owner
every time makin joked about it i would hit back with "i don't really want it," but that part was never a joke
AH DUN WAN IT
but nah, i'm more or less decent at handling people, but makin was way better at actually taking care of the server in the big picture
i'm too lazy and unmotivated
we're just rehashing information moon
honestly we should just have a higher tier of staff than mods, just "admins"
admins can give life and take it away
but we're rational so we'd only give life
obviously
<:doit:350074829354958868>
what was your timeout room like
welcome back to the land of the living
nights is pretty firmly gone, let her rest in peace
she didn't like how much of her time online stuff was taking up, so she's basically completely removed herself from it
which is sad, but understandable
she is one of the few to succeed and break through the simulation...
is
she
let's try this again
one
let's count to ten, /b/!
triangle!
four
FUCK
thread archived, fuck this
has jack black ever commented on the octagon collabs
these are truly impressive pieces of work
this brings me more joy than i can properly express
dero is truly a meme fountain
<:drewBitch:667945916128559125>
the topic is depressing
take us back off
i think that might be a no
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
gpt2 was already kind of eerie, is gpt3 that much of a step up
wait, what
so they like
gave it a description of a website and gpt3 spit the website out fully made?
that's
that's fucking terrifying
this is honestly disturbing
okay no
stop
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
well sure, but the fact that it can get such good results at all
the whole idea is that GPT is an iterative project where each new version draws on the best functioning aspects of the previous one, right
that would officially be the singularity
i'd rather have healthcare
both would be good though
now that we've gotten through the fever dream brave little toaster sequels, it's time to move on to... that's right, the don bluth movies
starting with land before time
i don't know about this, explain
i've never even seen it to begin with
is it good/interesting
no, i mean thief and cobbler in any form
i have no idea what that is, never seen the movie
GET OUT
jesus christ is secret of saurus rock ACTUALLY land before time IX
i thought it was like VI
shut up
dammit i wasn't fast enough
anyway you deserve death
i didn't _dislike_ princess bride but i definitely don't feel the same love for it that most people seem to
it was a good movie but i've never felt a compulsion to watch it again
i feel like the humor wasn't quite dry enough to land, i think i prefer the more overt monty python flavor of that kind of thing
we should definitely watch it again here at some point
i still don't think i've ever seen life of brian?
the only other monty python movie i've seen was meaning of life
alright, let's watch it tomorrow maybe?
i'm gonna get it uploaded right now then
never saw blazing saddles either
isn't that the one with gene wilder
alright, i'll get life of brian and blazing saddles up tonight, and we can have a movie night tomorrow
how does that sound
young frankenstein was kind of funny but far from a movie that comes to mind when i think of gene wilder
i have definitely never heard of buckaroo banzai
bladerunner is... controversial
less so nowadays, it used to be WAY more contentious
but there's still some reservations about it
also which of the four thousand endings are we talknig about
any of the ones that proscribe ridley scott's vision suck
anyway watch blade runner on your own time, it's a masterpiece on a technical level and i don't think anyone can rebuff that statement
the story is very boring though, so if you can't handle that it's not for you
also i hate the idea that he's a replicant, not gonna lie
gnawms i'm not saying that to indicate i hate the movie, bladerunner is like an exercise in meditation and i'm extremely fond of it
but the story is objectively boring
it's extremely slow and plodding and quiet most of the time
i like those qualities just fine, but most people have trouble with it
do you people have any reading comprehension
i _love_ bladerunner
me saying the story is boring is not mutually exclusive
it is if you're a moron, next question
alright, working on life of brian now
i'm excited for movie night tomorrow, this is going to be fun
i should clarify by "movie night" i actually mean afternoon, because we have euros in here
say 2 or 3 PM or so
life of brian and blazing saddles
there's a fair number of us here who have never seen either
so does meaning of life
meaning of life literally ends with a character choosing the method of his own execution to be getting ran off a cliff by a horde of naked women
yeah, well
this'll be a lesson in historical culture
these are films that have influenced our social upbringing and ideas of humor for the last several decades
cy we're literally talking about watching it tomorrow
yes yark
done
also let's say we'll start at 3 PM EST
woc i think you're right on the cusp of being considered a zoomer
you're not based, you're just edgy
this isn't your culture, this is like two generations before your time
LMAO
yes, precisely
i just realized that dero is older than 90% of you, including woc
dero is only 3 years younger than i am
than me
whatever
done dead guy
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
you missed out tera, we marathoned the indy films last year
adam sandler is mid 90s
billy madison, happy gilmore, and the waterboy are the things he's arguably most known for, and those are 1995, 1996, and 1998
click is the only other thing he's made that has a semblance of integrity or meaning in it, everything outside of that has been the worst shit extruded from the ugliest butt
tensei has a point that rewatching or redoing the same thing over and over and over again is not constructive
but he's also a fucking party pooper
sometimes it's comfy to re-enjoy something you're already familiar with
<:FeelsComfyPepo:332685201085825026>
yeah, most of our rewatches or whatever have been kind of spontaneous
"holy shit do you guys want to watch the room again this weekend"
nothing wrong with this
"hey guys it's time for our semi-annual rewatch of freddy got fingered"
this is frankly disturbing
that movie is good to watch like...
...
.....
.......
i don't actually know
i think maybe three times
first time before i ever joined this server, second about a year ago, and then a third time earlier this year because makin had never seen it and the horror had faded from our minds
hm
it seems that covid-19 is more easily spread through the air than was previously suggested in studies, so social distancing isn't completely effective at preventing contamination
conversely, face masks appear to be better at preventing the spread and contraction of the virus than previously suggested, as long as you're wearing the right mask properly
too bad people aren't social distancing OR wearing face masks here, so it's a moot point either way you slice it
i don't know about that, sounds incorrect to me
or at least kind of contextual
like, if you're sufficiently far apart from each other? sure
if you're fucking huffing someone else's mouth air then no
protests didn't spike anything because far and away most people attending were progressive and thus wearing face masks
even in a situation where most people are infected with the virus, wearing face masks prevents about 95% of uninfected individuals from contracting it, and those who DID get infected showed very little severity in symptoms because the sheer amount of virions they were exposed to was reduced
i'm kind of jaded on social distancing because literally no one cares to follow the principle here
at this point it's not a matter of if you'll get sick, but when
boy i sure wish testing was widely available by this point
and also that data on infection and death rates wasn't being actively lied about by our reporting institutions
cy, knock it off
i think being tested here is only _allowed_ if you're showing definite related symptoms, and then it takes upwards of 2 weeks to get the results
<:mikeWhat:675066309712674836>
<:thinkingBlank:300762780112257024>
upon thinking about it, i'm not sure that bringing back beavis and butthead is all that good an idea
i like beavis and butthead plenty but the show didn't stick around longer than it needed to
if mike judge wants to have a commentary on modern culture, would it be better to have stereotypically stupid characters who fit a more contemporary profile
beavis and butthead are both comical takes on blockheads from like the 80s and 90s
you need some gen z idiots, not gen x
a neckbeard/incel for one
beavis and butthead are pretty sexist, i think that would fit the label
not sure who else though, i try not to think about depressing people that often
mocking beavis and butthead is practically the point of the show
they're explicitly not meant to be relatable or sympathetic characters
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i mean, you're kind of right
```The series centers on two unintelligent teenage delinquent couch potatoes named Beavis and Butt-Head (both voiced by Judge) who lack social skills. They go to school at Highland High located in Highland, Texas. If they are not at school or out causing mayhem, they will be in front of the TV. Beavis and Butt-Head have no adult supervision at home and are barely literate. Both lack any empathy or moral scruples even when regarding each other. They will usually deem their encounters as "cool" if they are associated with heavy metal, violence, sex, destruction, or the macabre. While inexperienced with women, they share an obsession with sex and tend to chuckle whenever they hear words or phrases that could be even vaguely interpreted as sexual, carnal or scatological. ```
i was just posting that for general viewing
as it is, what about the show makes you say that it's flat out bad
i'm interested in your take
i don't think that disaffected teenagers _were_ the target demo for beavis and butthead honestly
the show is a display of the worse parts of american culture in the 90s
```Beavis and Butt-Head are so stupid and sublimely self-absorbed that the exterior world has little reality except as an annoyance or distraction. It would be easy to attack B&B as ignorant, vulgar, depraved, repulsive slobs. Of course they are. But that would miss the point, which is that Mike Judge's characters reflect parts of the society that produced them. To study B&B is to learn about a culture of narcissism, alienation, functional illiteracy, instant gratification and television zombiehood.```
roger ebert
i don't know about it being taken seriously, it's more just being exposed to those kinds of ideas
i think taking beavis and butthead seriously as something in a vacuum is extraordinarily dumb
obviously the show and its characters are bluntly crass and moronic
it's kind of like freddy got fingered, where the meaning or humor or whatever are obtained as a result of considering the show in a larger context
freddy got fingered is an insane, extremely dumb and bad movie
but it is _so_ dumb that it is funny to think of the fact that it got made in the first place, and the decisions that went into making it
you're just a disaffected teenager, your opinion doesn't count
you're taking it for granted that your appraisal of the show is self-explanitory
but you haven't actually provided any sort of reasoning for it
okay, but do you enjoy sweet bro and hella jeff
well, at least you're consistent
```Early episodes depicted a juvenile obsession with fire and other dangerous behaviors, summed up with Beavis's chanting of "Fire! Fire!". ... all references to fire were removed from subsequent airings and prompted the show to a later time slot.[18] The creators found a censorship loophole and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous "Fire! Fire!" (such as "Fryer! Fryer!" when he and Butt-Head are working the late shift at Burger World) and also having him almost say the forbidden word (such as one time when he sang "Liar, liar, pants on ..." and pausing before "fire").```
this is wonderful
being able to dissect something is far more important than the basal level of whatever it is you're looking at
mundane or idiotic things can still be enjoyable, and there's value in exploring why that is
yeah, that's literally why we talk in here most of the time
this channel is constant, unending wankery about analyzing things and why they do or don't work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XchwE9zVdnw
there's something primal in this that just makes me laugh
i can't believe that this was something that aired on prime time television
good question
this was a decade before adult swim, i feel like there were more cultural restrictions back when B&B aired versus 2000 or so
i don't think i would class B&B as "ironically bad"
ironic badness is a very specific thing, like sweet bro and hella jeff is explicitly that
because it's specifically made to be as shitty as possible, and somehow manages to be funny through that quality because it hits just right
B&B sets out to illustrate how vapid and ignorant the culture of the 90s could be and it succeeds at doing that
focusing on the fact that B&B themselves are moronic is like a surface level analysis
like, obviously they are stupid, i don't think that them being stupid is where the enjoyment of the show is supposed to begin and end
like i said, there's like a meta-level enjoyment that can be derived from stuff like this
i personally enjoy it and FGF for similar reasons, namely "i literally cannot believe that this is something that got created and was put out there for people to experience"
it manages to push the boundaries on my suspension of disblief
and that's kind of cheating because it's not a quality that's specifically inherent to the work itself, but still
also if that's how you're thinking about it then i would argue you're not actually all that familiar with 90s culture
most of the 90s was specifically indulging in the kinds of things that B&B started _making fun_ of people for
wait, i have that backwards
look, i'll be honest, i'm a fraud
i was born in 1994 so my experiential awareness doesn't start until the mid 2000s at the earliest
i'm only aware of B&B because my dad is a fan of the show
my understanding is that B&B is subversive of culture from the mid to late 80s, and then as cy stated, B&B kind of got seinfelded in the form of shows like south park
beavis and butthead was created in 1993, south park was 1997
culture in this context doesn't refer to the literal media/content that people were watching, but rather the attitude and beliefs of the people themselves
i also don't mean to suggest that culture in 80s america was exclusively B&B-like, but the characters themselves are clearly meant to be personifications of the worst parts of that culture
imbecilic couch potato stoners
i don't know, that's a hard question to answer
i think it comes down to individual taste really
i've told you why i personally like it
those interstitched clips of them making fun of music videos was actually mandated by MTV because every show on the network was supposed to involve music somehow
i think i opened this very conversation by saying "i'm not sure if this show makes sense to reboot in a modern context"
the day i'm even remotely comparable to beavis or butt-head is the day i disappear into the wilderness, never to be seen again
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
yes, but that picture was taken three years ago
thank you my child
jesus i look like a fucking homeless man
what even inspired you to do this
i'll be sure to tell my younger self that as soon as i can
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
describe the concept to me in DMs i guess
stop being an asshole to the users in your channel
ah, fuck
i forgot it's kamen rider stream today
we were talking about classic comedies last night and it came up that many people in lit have never seen life of brian or blazing saddles, including me
so i set up both of those movies to watch today, and set a time for 2 PM EST
i would have st it later but euros exist
i don't know, i can probably push it back an hour
kamen rider stream doesn't last more than two hours or so yeah
er, not 2 PM EST
3 PM EST
yeah
i was kind of hoping he would be able to get past that but i guess it was just too much
i can't blame anyone who feels like they can't handle this atmosphere, we are pretty aggressive at times
but i stick to the idea that we're aggressively constructive whenever we can manage it
obviously it's not always like that, but i wouldn't be here if i didn't think that the good qualities outweighed the bad
just not for everybody i suppose
this is fair
misha brought up a good point in western-media
life of brian and blazing saddles are both long movies and, besides not wanting to spend even more time on streams today than we already are with kamen rider
i have shit to do
so we're only going to watch life of brian, starting at 3:30 PM EST
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> wow, this appears to be pretty divisive
i mean, we are eventually going to watch blazing saddles too
i just don't want to do two movies in one day
consider it like this: if you think that blazing saddles is better, then we're saving the best for last
yeah i know it's my call
and i'm saying we're watching life of brian first
get fucked idiots
misha shut up
no brap jokes
fuck you misha that got me
wait are these _real_
holy shit <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i'm fucking losing it
also tensei a lot of us haven't seen it yet, including me
that's literally the reason we chose blazing saddles AND life of brian
i missed it
nah i've seen that a few times
look, i never intend to AFK when i join streams
it's not my fault my life is busy
i kind of want a shirt with that stereotypical 80s wavy cup design on it
yes... YES...
thanks krato
yeah, clowns somehow got weaponized into being symbols of the alt right
go get some you fucking reprobrate
no
dogs only
no cat
gen z is already practically adults
we're already moving on to the next generation
gen xers are on the way out
millenials and gen z are likely the next big influences on the world
<:meenUgh:528364914725879818>
i got the timing wrong, the kamen rider stream is still going
give it uh
stfu
misha is literally using the room
i'm not barging in on time he reserved for it
<@&693935623966425219> just a heads up, once misha's kamen rider stream is over in about 30-45 minutes, i'll ping again and we'll start life of brian, don't be late
monty python movie
it's artistic in nature, i'm safe baybee
almost time for stream, i'm gonna grab some food, get ready
I need to find my fucking chopsticks
The place I'm getting food from has very chopsticky food but no chopsticks
I am in fistress
Nah I know where my chopsticks are, I just have to get them out of storage
Its hawaiin food
Got some spicy chicken
Jeusu Christopher Mary Joseph god shit pants be PATIENT
<@&693935623966425219> alright it's time, let's get going with life of brian <https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight>
oh shit
uh
i think google may have flagged life of brian as unplayable despite the reencoding
so we might do blazing saddles instead
nevermind it's still processing
we're just gonna do blazing saddles now
get in here
oh SHIT
it seems he's back
no, it's more that he's finally rearranging the chapter
it was originally one big fat chapter and now he's finally split it apart
and he's conducting passes
that's the first progress we've seen in like a month
yeah that was actually way better than i expected, and ESPECIALLY after the beginning
those first 20-30 minutes were not very entertaining
i flat out did not enjoy the first part, i was honestly questioning why people thought the movie was so good
it was directly after gene wilder was introduced that i started loving the shit out of it
also the meta is indeed handled very well
4th wall breaks and such
yeah unironically woc
man, what a trip
i'm definitely pleased that we decided to watch that
now for the real question: when do we watch life of brian
no, let's not even speak of the slurs
despite the fact that they aren't featured as prominently in the later part
i just don't think that particular avenue of discussion is productive
like, it comes down to "i can excuse this" or "i can't excuse this" and there's not much else for it
this video is like chaotic
yeah, annex your conquered states like a true man
Sad bweee
Movie was fun, I'm sad its over
Also I'm moving again, which is always a process I really hate
Thankfully gonna be able to do it relatively quickly this time, but still
Carl my life isn't in a stable place right now
I'm not sure when I'll be able to settle down long term, possibly a while
Theres just too much shit going on
Horrible
nice
that image is as old as the internet itself
it's a classic
i'm partial to this one, it's from before the era where everyone started using the impact font and mememaker for everything
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
unacceptable
i'm probably gonna grow my hair out again
i'm lazy and have no professional expectations for the foreseeable future
i haven't gone without a beard in a very long time
do you mean like
shit with a short beard
hm
okay then
chin strap...
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
yeah why not
it begins
i am too hot and too tired to continue
but why
always has been
awful awful awful awful morning
got woken up at 6, then again at 7, couldn't go back to sleep, so now i'm
just fucking up i guess
time to be pissed off for the rest of the day because of this
death
how's that for a power
hot chocolatey milk
it was a joke, shitstain
i don't like scary shit
i'm a huge weenie
yesterday's movie was blazing saddles
if you need to watch it i have link
cool, cool
also life of brian finally finished processing so we can watch it whenever
should be cobra kai today, it's wednesday
unless makin is still holding to his dumbass protest against kamen rider, in which case fuck him we'll watch life of brian anyway
i would argue that ratfics actually make humans act _less_ like humans
or characters rather
because ratfics often enough have a compulsion to make their protags and surrounding characters as smart as possible, and react to every situation in an optimal manner
which is not how it works at all
okay, sure
the question is, who is the question
i have to admit, fish heads are pretty freaky looking
they're pretty close to us on the grander scale of evolutionary history but fish are fucking strange creatures
yes
what in the actual fuck
huskies are wonderful creatures
tangentially, though, have i mentioned i fucking hate pets
they're all the work of a toddler without any of the satisfaction of knowing they'll become intelligent
by "all the work of a toddler" i'm mostly referring to vomiting and shitting in places they aren't supposed to
yeah, i used to own five of them at the same time
did you forget i was raised in the country
bum fuck egypt
from the ages of 11-18 we had five dogs, four cats, a dozen chickens, some ducks at one point even though i literally don't remember that, and two horses
i had to take care of all of them
dogs are intelligent creatures, but i mean compared to a human
tell that to our maine coon who just shit all over the floor while we were sleeping
in her defense she exists almost purely outside
it's rare to catch her in the house, she just visits
but still, like
she could have done it outside
fucking CATS
cats are totally capable of witnessing something a human does and disliking them for it
hm
lmfao woc
that's always startling
one of our mousers did that while i was playing halo one time, i tossed the controller out of surprise and nearly busted the tv screen
oh yeah, this is that leaked email from a sony exec which shows how out of touch AND scummy/opportunistic they are, right
i think blanket stating "games are art" is contentious, but "game _can be_ art" is braindead obvious
good point
oh no, this conversation went in the direction of "what counts as art" real fuckin fast
everything may be art, but you know what art is?

typically chili ends when everyone's done eating it
<:eyeslegacy:422499964430843923>
i always imagined vinny as a disembodied voice until the sonic movie trailer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q30Uxr5zp7I if you haven't seen this, do yourself a favor, it's rather entertaining
i'm sorry woc but nothing can possibly top xkcd goatse
<@!207991389613457408> y'all got ~~bones in ya shit then~~ meaning of life ready to go?
man, that is fucking terrible
i feel bad for the wrestler and the dead guy's family, when stuff pops up out of the blue like that it's terrifying
we
whoops
we'll do life of brian here in like 45 minutes, 2:30 PM EST
<@&693935623966425219> be here for life of brian at the above mentioned time, you have 45 minutes
nearly pinged everyone by accident, whew
not sure about within the UK but globally yeah
well, they originally wanted to have a proper ending but they didn't know how to pull it off
and also budget i think
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
this makes me deeply uncomfortable
and the fact that he's actually bothering to eat this stuff a bit
what the fuck is going on here gord
is there anybody out there?
ten minutes <:joeyHyped:273932430338031618>
yeah idiot
life of brian in ten minutes, not my fault you're a wiener who's throwing a hissy fit over kamen rider and withholding kino cobra kai
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
it doesn't get much worse than members of the official team being actively hostile to their own fanbase
that's when you know you've hit rock bottom
<@&693935623966425219> it's time for life of brian get in here mofuckas <https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight>
this is why having oversight when you're working on something is important
if i hadn't had guidance when i was a graduate student i would have procrastinated until i died in a pool of my own filth
yeah, i have no idea why it's not working on cytube
i tested it out like an hour ago and it was just fine
well, we might as well watch that now
no, i turned it off
let me try it in a different cytube deal
i've never had to do that before, i'll give it a shot
nope
did not work
bruh
the video is fucking _playable_ in browser
or, wait
that might just be becausei 'm viewing it on my account
see if you can view the video on your own in browser, just open up a new tab
if you can't see it then yeah, plan bean is in effect
i might have, reencoding usually works
<@!207991389613457408> so we're officially out of options
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
fuck you, i checked to make sure it was working before we started
you set up a movie night and see how _you_ like it
IT'S A LOT OF WORK ISN'T IT
i'm not enjoying it too much so far
maury was way more entertaining
yeah officially not a fan of this movie
guess i was expecting too much from a poorly animated movie about fucking beans
nah, there are people in there actually enjoying themselves
we'll do maury afterwards if you guys want
lmao
yeah alright, let me pop that on
congressional hearings are now on the cytube <https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight>
get in here or perish
is it over
seems so, thank god
guess we'll watch more maury another day
won't be able to do that until tomorrow night
maury is hilarious
you just have to be in the right frame of mind for it
did they not actuall--yeah
disney is absolutely attempting to corner markets and establish a huge monopoly
CRINGE BASED CRINGE BASED CRINGE BASED
brazilian portuguese is like its own dialect isn't it
stream's back in my asshole
you said it buster
why is that even an assertion i would have to make, what is the context of that
i would look it up but i'm lazy
i'vee managed to stop chewing on my nails for the last few weeks somehow, so they're finally growing out for the first time in many years
it's kind of nice being able to scratch things properly
but typing is also super weird now
i keep feeling the slight pressure of my fingernail hitting the keys before my fingers do and it's throwing me off
also how the fuck are you supposed to keep the undersides clean throughotu the day
gottem
does anyone know whether the author of game of champions has released the second half of the synopsis of the rest of the story
i crave it
this looks like the beginning of a fucking vibe check
RATS
you're a UI

it's got an extreme learning curve

the existence of god only proves the existence of god

that god made a world full of URINE and FECES
here is a fact: dennis praeger should frighten you.
do you think we'll ever get tired of YTPs in general
the nice thing about good old p.u. is that it came out like a year ago
quality YTPs are still being made
i didn't realize that was the name of a YTP for a second
i thought you were genuinely asking me
and i was completely flabbergasted
that thumbnail is familiar, i believe i've seen this already
yep, definitely saw this at some point
i didn't give it a proper watch though
Camera for Anal
what the fuck <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
"One-Hand Fap Continuity"
yeah this is better than i remembered
not super great but definitely quality
delightful
terrorists your game is through
it's rewind time
how can he help you
that aged poorly
it was way more offensive than i expected
conduct unbecoming and all that
i got to brock and stopped
fucking hell <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
yes please
he takes offense to being called fake
but yes good morning
have i missed anything good
i missed a rant against mass property ownership? dman
the genocide part is a little fucked up but landlords need some correcting
was this lat being hyperbolic again or was he actively, seriously saying we should kill all landlords
<:WhatCat:465911214552121374>
i like top middle
sharp color, good proportions on that N
oh, if it's the "proper logo" it's probably bottom left?
tell me the answer or suffer for your sins
alderaan!
i started thinking of things to try and find one that can't poke someone's eye out
does it count if you have to apply enough force to destroy the object and then basically pus through with your fingers
i'm basically talking about jelly balls
ooh, that too tera
yeeaahhh...

i saw that

remember, you're here forever
i stole a loaf of breeeaaad

shout out to the time people were quoting fesh pince and someone pinged cyrene with "would you make me a sandwich," but cy was unfamiliar with the video so she thought it was a misogynistic joke and banned them
HE HE HE <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
guess it's just a fesh pince kind of morning
my brain is having a hard time processing it, i hate waking up early
I HAVE NOT SLEPT - Teratoputin
it's too bad life of brian is busted
i feel like watching a movie
suggestions?
it'd have to be a movie someone else has ready or is on youtube
look, i like monty python but i'm not a NEEEERRRRRD
so i don't know the joke
yeah see
you people are dorks
i have literally never heard of this movie
i'd be down to watch it today, except kamen rider starts in the early afternoon
oh no
what the fuck does that mean
thanks babe
i want that perfume to smell the same way your mouth tastes the second before you vomit, like you're sucking on a bunch of pennies
no you dumbshit
have you never actually sucked on a copper penny
then you should know that they taste very similar, the taste of metal
you get the same taste the second before you throw up
<@!111477124384202752> immediately prior to throwing up, your esophagus and mouth excrete more saliva and i think another substance that keeps it from being burned by stomach acid
those two things together lead to a sharp metallic taste
that's how most people describe it anyway
anyway it's not blood you fucking chode
i'm pretty sure i would recognize if i was vomiting blood
i also throw up basically never
i hate the feeling so much that i do everything in my power to avoid it
throwing up is bad, mmkay
god, linky just hitting NOTHING for the last several days
<:absolutelydisgusting:345034074815070208>

big mcthankies from mcspankies
how the fuck are those loaves so big
also i don't know about fishing but i definitely want to at some point soon
a birthday card that sucks me into the abyss? count ME in
but nah, thanks guys
i was intentionally trying to keep it on the down low but it's nice to hear birthday wishes
look, linkybot is already uncomfortably close to a cult of personality thing
making people celebrate my birthday would be full blown kooky dictatorship
"yes, wish your dear leader well"
oof
i just didn't want to make a big deal reeee
is it?
i thought i had made it public
how to fix
"my steam game list is private?"
"always has been"
the only embarrassing thing about my steam game list is the fact that i got some of those sakura hentai games or whatever through a humble bundle a couple years ago
üéÇ
my odor more highly ocncentrates itself with each passing secon
<@!119054275245506560> alright, i think i fixed it
not that i want you to give me a game at all costs or anything, i just didn't realize the list was private
oh man i haven't watched an epichappybirthday video in like three years
ROCK AND ROLL AND CELEBRATE ***CELEBRATE WE WILL***
holy shit what, is that alien segment new
wack
no this is great, thank you
i'm sorry i'm not being totally responsive, taking care of my grandma today
either way, i really appreciate it everyone
oh _shit_
thank you saeko, i've been meaning to try out baba is you for months
very excited for this
ü§µ
which one has been handled worse, star citizen or hiveswap
wow, you guys didn't even hesitate
every single word i see out of yandev makes me feel weirder about him
like, is he oblivious to how cartoonishly evil he is
maybe it's the fact that yandev is a con-artist
also yes, why would twitch allow a game where you're upskirting children
it's kind of pathologically sick
... i mean, i wouldn't be surprised
i certainly don't like him for it
i don't know why we're splitting hairs to be honest, _everything_ about yandev sucks
depends on what you consider mentally unwell
like, does it impact his ability to make a living? clearly not, given everything
but does he function on the same level as an empathetic human? hell no
qweq, you remind me of how i used to want to be
very optimistic and charitable
i _still_ want to be like that
this last year has been so terrible though, it's hard to keep that up after a while
i hope you stick with it
oh nice
marble race is just silly fun qweq
it's not just about watching the events, it's aobut getting into the theater of it
every team has custom chants, history, and i think backstories for the "team members"
i think he said that like every time he went to speak
the zuck is breaking down, he needs repairs
he might try but i'm not sure how
someone on reddit suggested that he might try to get certain states to refuse to validate their results in the general election, and prevent either candidate from receiving the 270 electoral votes needed to become president
but it's _also_ true that if no new president is elected, then the leader of the house of representatives takes over at the appointed time
which would be nancy pelosi
yes
that's in case of death or incapacitation
this is an entirely different case
oh, you're just describing the chain of succession in general
yeah nevermind
nancy pelosi will be an extremely at-risk target if this looks like it'll happen, yeah
that must be a leftover from when presidents were expected to take the loser as their VP, that was standard practice back in the early years of the country
you know the kicker of it all
the GDP for the second quarter of this year was published today, and it's literally the worst it's ever been on record
so i'm not really sure if calling for a delay to the election is a distraction, or if the reverse is true
the great depression was 1929
apparently the US only started tracking GDP in 1937 <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
```The modern concept of GDP was first developed by Simon Kuznets for a US Congress report in 1934.[11] In this report, Kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare```
i'm glad that we took his advice oh wait
people tie the notion of welfare with the economy all the time now, how did this happen
all i know is that i need to purchase an air conditioner
<a:aWackySmushy:394353102381383680>
this emote is heavily underused, i need to drag it out more
also i wasn't referring to an apocalyptic scenario, i don't think we're fucked in that way
humanity is--i'm gonna regret saying it like this--almost too advanced to really die off or completely collapse at this point
the technology at our disposal is fucking insane compared to our predecessors
well yeah you can fish
yeah i bet [checks notes] the republic of the gambia is pretty glad they're off the radar
all the time jovie
the gameplay demo looks questionable but the gameplay _trailer_ was much better
i don't feel quite so pessimistic about it
modern PCs generally look much better than consoles actually
you ever think ~~bout thos Beans~~ ~~about that scene from Terminator 2 when the nuclear bomb hits the city and everyone is fucking incinerated~~ this scene from Bojack Horseman where he hangs out with a homeless guy and calls him john stamos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE8U2W0LyhQ
CAROLYN... JOHN STAMOS _DIED_
oh shit, that looks great
practice
that too
i'd love to travel by sea but only if i get to sing sea shanties
we stopped doing sacrifices and that was the reward for anyone who participated in the last sacrifice
it's a totally different landscape now
altgen is for people who crave absolute, unmitigated degeneracy
people come here for slightly less intense degeneracy
skyward sword
i hate skyward sword as a zelda game but it's not that bad
like, if skyward sword was any other title it would... probably get ignored
but it's more or less constructed well
<:yikes:294612676770922498>
no
let's talk about shrek
:shrek:
dammit
remember when someone managed to compress the entire shrek movie into the size of an emote
we're not marathoning shrek, only the first two are worth watching
i refuse to watch the dumbass triplets or AU movies
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> fuck, there it is
i think discord hates that image actually, doesn't it cause some weirdness in storage
spider i consider your ra--oh my god
okay, i thought it was just a random still image
then it started to change and it genuinely freaked me out for a second
quarantine is driving everyone nuts
we need to get out of here
This
i think tarty just means at life, not anything in particular
jonah hill is clearly a renowned hollywood presence
but he's jonah hill
the dude never had a chance
dude, everyone and their fucking mom knows who jonah hill is
the problem isn't awareness, it's that he's fucking jonah hill and is thus the butt of the biggest joke of all: life
seth rogen is vaguely more attractive
i got as far as "copped a lot of flab" and now i'm literally struggling not to laugh
also yeah dero as a general rule i feel less bad for rich people? not because i feel like they're subhuman, although a lot of them kind of are, but they have the most important thing for establishing a support system for themselves, so they'll be fine
i don't know
i think that in the hands of someone who is truly, unassailably benevolent, that kind of richness could be put to good use to benefit people
hell, if you can find someone like that, give them all the money
they'll figure out how best to use it
yeah obviously jamie, i was just providing a dumb rebuttal
YOU EVER USE THIS CHANNEL BEFORE
what about geoff
holy fuck THAT'S what that was
i had no idea <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

hello my lit
what's happening tonight
thank you i definitely feel older than when i woke u
insufferable
i'm now addicted to narcotics
i celebrated with some chinese food from my favorite local place
yeah, i'm sad i missed misha's stream
thankee
lmao
i've never played more than like 15 minutes of deus ex
i found it frustrating because it's old
pretty sure masnora was purposeful
"snore"
having guests on when you stream is really fun
i'll be sure to check out the VOD if my internet will allow it
sorry i missed the stream misha
big mcthankies from mcspankies
no andrew is right for once, i'm CST now
unbelievable
i almost, _almost_ want to post that hugh neutron webm in here, but i think it's just way too gross
nesquik was in and out, quick and easy
hugh neutron is like torture
why do we enjoy potty humor so much
it's terrible
jesus, at this rate we might as well post hugh neutron
why not, honestly
we've already experienced shit just as bad
jesus christ i have fucking tears in my eyes
the context of the video at large also just destroys me
I JUST OILED IT
cheeze, can i take a moment to say i'm fucking astounded at the things you have done and can do with oot
wait, what
why
i don't get it
what exactly are they trying to reconstruct and how are they doing it
i mean, i get all that
i'm just confused how they're able to reverse engineer source code from the final product if the game literally removes entire elements of what the engineers worked on
wouldn't shit like the beta hyrule market map and kokiri forest be considered superfluous
... then who fuckin cares
what are you supposed to be able to do with reverse engineered source code
coding-support is thataway ye code monkeys
why is having an old switch lucky
oh nice
i bought a switch on day one so that's nice
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
nice
wait, do you F12 when you boot up and manually select which drive to start from
the fuck
that's even better somehow
giant rat creation story
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
rereading first chapter of game of champions, i had forgotten just how arrogant this writing sounded
```Contrary to popularized belief, empathy did not beget power.``` this in particular stands out
it just rankles with me
512 MB of ram...
current computer is 32 GB of RAM, 1080Ti, 3.8 GHz processing
the RAM is overkill but i needed it for work
THIS
IS
what the fuck are sudbury schools
```It probably has something to do with how little respect I have for people who don't make their own futures.``` groan worthy
this like ayn rand levels of self-aggrandizing bullshit
i'm reading through game of champions again, because i've satisfied my desire to play old pokemon games for now
i forgot how arrogant this story is written to be
pokemon fanfic, based on first gen
basically "what if pokemon was the real world and had all of the actual consequences of animals with what are basically magic powers"
also no, i tried reading origin of species and was terribly bored by it
it had no passion in it
as much as i'm shitting on game of champions for sounding like it was written by a hyper-libertarian, the story is actually quite inspiring and has undeniable flair to it
i highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of pokemon, especially first few gens
shut up zoomer
better, cheeze: team rocket has guns and explosives
i don't imagine your finger moving slowly towards the mouse, i imagine it growing another segment and slowly arching over with ever-increasing knuckles
i will watch this fight with great interest
edo
```I ended up selling the pelt to a girl a few years older than me, managing the stall for her mother I guessed. I'm proud to say I completely rooked her, the pelt only being worth half as much as I got for it.``` this has to be intentionally played up, i find it hard to imagine any reasonable person would be able to genuinely revel in something like this
```"... Gary Oak isn't some punk kid, you know? He's a hurricane on the horizon, a monster in the cradle. People like him only come along once in an age. Look at Lance, look at steven Stone. A company heir and a mountain tribesman, but you could have switched them or thrown them anywhere in the world and they'd still be where they are today. Champions. It's who they are. It's what they're born for."``` this is interesting, it helps me to understand the mindset that's at work here
also yes, big and bulky, extended rear, distinctive on and off sounds
infinite resolution??
yeah, i thought it sounded weird
i distinctly remember putting my face directly on CRTs and seeing little blobs of discreet somethings
i wanted brain damage
what about coaxial
you haven't lived until you've had electrons beamed directly into your fucking eye sockets
seen it already, disgusting
the resolution of a CRT: my ass
stupid?
NONE OF YOU ARE FREE OF SIN
man, it's weird reading this again, because most of the qualities i see espoused in game of champions are things i kind of despise
stoicism, forced rugged individualism, arrogance
not sure how i'm able to enjoy the story so much despite these things
what does "trad" mean here
i know it stands for traditional, but how does it relate
zent, i think you're being overly pessimistic
clearly the shills function to at least some degree, we all end up talking about them infrequently
and some of them very frequently
the point is not to establish a solid cult of following, it's to engender discussion
the best shills are the ones that facilitate the most discussion
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
also i mean, i don't blame scott
he spends an unbelievable amount of time on SSC
dude deserves some recompense for it
jesus
i also scrolled up and reviewed, it looks like impersonal ribbing from a bunch of people at once that was all aimed at cy
it didn't seem that bad personally but it's difficult to roll with that when you're also trying to talk about something seriously
i would try to adjudicate this but it's 4:30 AM and my brain is dying
silence, thots
what i'm getting from this is that cy is vindicated and multi is a dong inhaler
i will freely admit to unfairly admonishing cy for making the same kinds of jokes that we've allowed woc and misha to perpetrate in here
there's gonna be some changes 'round these parts
for real this time
because makin is on the job now
and he will not hesitate to kill
then this channel shall die
üå©Ô∏è
oh did he freeze the channel again
i am above such earthly concerns
did cairn actually describe their ideas
HOW CURIOUS
but yes cairn
we end up getting involved in these absurd battles but literature is important, please continue
gharials are interesting
that's all i've got to say about them unfortunately
i'm not much of a fan of ginger beer, but i must not remember the taste enough, fuck you mean nhot sauce
that looks like they tried to fry an entire ass chicken leg tempura style
does that even work
corned beef
well, at least you have some taste
every time i think of corned beef, i weep for brisket
tipsy, i want to make a deal with you
if i ever happen to be in the area, i would like to sample your favorite meat dishes
conversely, if you ever find yourself in shitty america, come to kansas city and i will treat you to local BBQ
i don't know why i made this sound like a singular arrangement, i would gladly get BBQ with anyone from HSD who comes here
but still
at this point that hugh neutron intro is like a weapon
whenever i see him in the thumbnail it's like "oh boy, is this something innocuous or am i going to get thunderous farts"
too bad i'm clamping down on shitposting or else i'd post it right now, it's just that existentially horrifying
oh my fucking god
i'm finally done with my day
i hate moving
in fairness most of my day was actually cleaning, but still
lmao no, it's my grandparent's place
i'm moving in to take care of them as they grow old and feeble and eventually die
i haven't really unpacked anything so basically yeah
staying with my dad after i got back was always a brief, temporary deal
staying with grandparents is different, i'm probably going to be here until the one passes away
<:_bruh:728606936962039909>
proceed
FUK
i think that i am FINALLY done with moving
i don't even have my fucking computer set up but that's peanuts compared to moving things
>now move out
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
i hope i don't have to move again for like six thousand years
always the worst process
and i haven't even been able to catch up on misfits or cobra kai
why fucking live
d
whoops
holy shit
that clip is fucking viscerally satisfying
er
i meant to say HORRIFYING
freudian slips are going to kill me
<:BlobHyperSweats:356555758579613716>
it's only july
er, now it's august actually
these better come in to play on halloween
tomorrow
probably
i am fucking tired
i just got done cleaning an entire hosue and moving in
i will kill
alright, enough ghost mod posting
get back in formation you shits
oh jesus christ don't remind me
school generally connotes to "mandatory"
which is no
sure does
i just oiled it
you're a PC hardware emulation aid
i have no idea what the fuck you're talking about
lmao
what in the god damn shit fuck
<a:thinkingsmushanimated:393682248622276618>

eat that shit
emphasis on shit
i have no idea what's going on, i'm trying to catch up on cobra kai
personally i want to do venture bros
but other than that i don't know what else has been suggested
there's a lot of people in here who haven't seen venture bros i'm pretty sure
HERE I GO AGAIN ON MY OOOWWWWN
GOIN' DOWN THE ONLY ROAD I'VE EVER KNOOOOOWN
it starts off as a parody of old cartoon serials like johnny quest but then rapidly develops its own mythos
they're not even remotely comparable
yeah sorry ifnar i'm trying to like
nevermind i'm making it more complicated than it needs to be
central focus is around the venture family, where the father is named rusty and is a "superscientist," he used to be a kid adventurer and his dad was the famous Dr. Venture
rusty has two kids hank and dean who are much less smart and adventurous
the family has a bodyguard named brock samson
the first season is basically them doing seemingly isolated episodes with no interconnectivity to speak of, and i hold that it's easily the roughest of the show
but immediately upon starting the second season, the story balloons into a very complex web and the show becomes extremely good
man what the fuck how else are you supposed to explain a thing
... because the show revolves around them?????
it would be one thing if i were naming random bullshit characters, but these are literally the main cast
what
i've definitely seen johnny quest
i used to watch it on boomerang
who cares what his name is, the show isn't that good
NO I WON'T HILL HIM
you realize that the premise of the show is laying out the basic details of setting and characters, right
that's literally what a premise is
i gave you the premise, albeit poorly
oh my fucking god ifnar
sit down you jackanape
üò¨
yeah i know
i got all the details right i just described it poorly
carlarc, i don't know if it was intentional, but the fact that you missed the "d" whi-- <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
fucking hell, that got me good
"fucking morons, they forgot the 'a' in 'aventure'"
season finales are usually 40
but i think that starts later
like season 4
alright die then
anyway that's totally what my vote is for
this is for a new audience
we have a lot of people here who join in the streams but have never seen it
that's worth a revisit
i'm literally watching the rest of the episodes of cobra kai i haven't seen
i'll spin my wheels whenever i damn want
venture bros was streamed to a small group of people, like five or six, two years ago
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
yeah i'd love to, i just need to reupload it
hopefully avoid getting flagged this time
i would ban makin myself
fuck sao, that's easy stuff
we should stream something really esoteric
STILL LOOKING!!
let's just put maury clips on for prestream
we'll literally never run out of those
dragon ball GT would be uh
mostly kind of miserable
i kind of wish i could say it'd be fun to make fun of but it's really not
GT is so fucking boring
I AIN'T WATCHIN NO WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEB TRAYUSH

while we're talking about anime, can anyone tell me what this konosuba thing is i keep hearing about
is that even real
lmao, how typical
everybody: "this shit sucks"

yeah dude that's great

ii'm dead
What did i miss today while I was out
What's the skinny
But we haven't even seen the game yet, maybe it'll blow our minds on release you never know
Scene pertaining to playing at ourselves not looking at the gameplay demo, I fully recognize that the demo look awful, but I'm sure the full game will be at least satisfying
I fucking hope so at least
Yeah Tory, I have been outside and doing a lot of stuff lately, hopefully things will settle down here for the next month or so, but there's really no way to tell, I can't seem to keep finding more things to do
Which really sucks, because I keep missing stuff in this server, and I'm tired of missing out on that stuff oh, it'd be nice to talk to you guys more, also yeah my my speech-to-text Library is not very good, it spelled Macan well you'll see it I guess
This is why idolizing people is bad
We have lots of behavior jokes that revolve around cult of personality, but thankfully I believe most of us avoid actually believing that certain people can do no wrong
eh squidward?
yeah you guys have only shown it like 4000 times in the last week

yeah, i think we need to let minecraft lay dead for a while
like, there's always a few people here who are endlessly ready for minecraft
but most people need a long time to recharge that
i don't want to play minecraft again for a long time, until i have that sudden spark where it's like "holy fucking shit i want to binge minecraft all day for a couple weeks"
that's always how minecraft is best enjoyed, like a maniac
fuck is dorf game
i have played dwarf fortress
i always get to the deep underground and then stop because i don't know what else to do at that point
also the micromanaging gets complicated and i forget what all i've got going on
fuck is deep rock galactic
hm
this sounds right up my alley to be honest
got a video with gameplay?
also this song is fuckin incredible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPoiv0sZ4s4
the bounce is addicting
oh, this isn't quite what i was expecting
it seems kind of rough around the edges
bitchin' music tho
i might be interested in playing this sometime
stream of consciousness is rarted in normal conversation, but it definitely has its place
actually i have a question
would it be possible for you guys to filter out conjunctions and other leading statements from linkybot
not like from the entire message but just from being the first word
so "and i don't think that's appropriate" becomes "i don't think that's appropriate"
i lead too many of my sentences with conjunctions and shit like that because i sometimes split my thoughts up into a few different messages
getting rid of those leading statements would increase usability of the linky function by at least 5%
then why live
you have no use to me besides the amusement you can provide me with
i demand satisfaction
imagine me saying that as i have a hapless servant feed me succulent grapes
<:KEKW:632036208750624799>
i could use some iconography
as long as i can get it at a discounted price

an excellent try, you saucy bastard
worked that time
thanks peanus weanus
sad!
did makin put up thread about pre-stream poll yet
i just thought of "i ambulatory to her" and i can't stop laughing like a moron
it never ends
what about longcat would you like to discuss
i would fall into that trap immediately
**turn to page 394**
it just depends on when everyone feels like playing
not sure when it'll happen

but yeah what's up
look at these _lips_
qweq i already answered you, whenever enough people feel like it
can you mention the game night role
just ask periodically if so
<:ree:466274625312260106>
if we have game night right now we're not playing monopoly, small group size or no
i'd like to play but it'd have to be something simple and sweet
well this got sad
how about we play some simple five card draw
i was just saying it was sad, not that it sucked
carl what is your malfunction
do you have poo brain
just for that i'm adding five more carlarc is banned messages to the pool
carlarc is banned

not yet... not yet...
wardwog
i don't fill it with bullshit often enough for that
unless you mean like
everything i say is bullshit
in which case, fair play
anyway <@&711911237700681789> anyone feel like a quick few rounds of poker
das one
well, don't be too quick
it looks like everyone who wanted to play games fucking disappeared all of a sudden
nevermind, game night is cancelled for now because qweq is a wiener
we can try to reconvene some hours from now
for now i'm going to beat sekiro's ass
"noooooooooooo drew you can't play things you enjoy over and over again"
"haha sword go klang"
also in my defense, i'm not just playing the game the exact same way over and over again either
i've been trying to add various challenging restrictions, kind of the same thing people do with dark souls
honestly, i don't even feel like playing sekiro that much right now either
i don't know WHAT i feel like doing, i think i'm just tired
i'm amazed your computer can handle ps2
it shits itself playing terraria
also just join woc's outfit
remind you of anything?
i've written before about our first bout of ss13
makin had an account on that was just meant to be like a test clown, and it was me, makin, and tensei
we were struggling to figure out the controls, and the intent behind actinos
we managed to unbuckle ourselves and tried to hug the clown, but all three of us started punching it instead
eventually the clown started choking because we were hitting it too much, so we tried to give it CPR but just kept beating the shit out of it
xenobio has come a long way since we first tried ss13
a lot safer
<:loss_jpg:280539833531760651>
wasn't he like a doctor
we miss you carl sagan
excellent movie
i know that you fucking nerd
i'm totally down for it
no
i'm afraid that i have bad news in that regard actually
where i'm living now really just does not have shit for internet
i looked extensively at services and plans in my area
i'm stuck at 3 Mbps down and 512 Kbps up
so someone else is going to have to take care of that shit if they want us to do movies
sorry fam squa
hello tera
hello ross
also yeah qweq that's called "living in bum fuck egypt"
yes
unironically yes
my only recourse is to get satellite internet and i'd have to pay out THE ASS to get that
i mean, it wouldn't suck as bad as this
data softcaps would be the worst part and i have a VPN
i don't know why but i'm just immensely irritated tonight

i'm going to come clean, i downed like 200 mL of vodka in 5 minutes and have been blasting 70's/80's music into my fucking eardrums ever since and i am having THE best time
i'm not even really drunk, i'm just heavily tipsy and i am on a fucking _groove_
i said 200 mL because that's what the bottle said you wiener
it's not like i got a graduated cylindr out and said "yes let me ration out my alcohol"
that's just what i picked up at the store
YOU SPIN ME RIGHT ME ROUND BABY RIGHT ROUUUNND
no, but that hasn't stopped me before
i have a cup that's got graduated markings on it
up to 355 mL
"poor" and "scientists" are practically synonyms

sunglasses at night is a great cheesy song
for clarity's sake
when i'm driving, i listen almost exclusively to channels that play music from the 60's to the 80s
if it's from that time span there's actually a decent chance i know it
assuming it's not some fucking weird bullshit
that's a good question
i sit down on my therapy chair
how does that make you feel
yeah, but we've had problems with people taking shitposting too far lately
brapposting in particular has become a plague
it is our responsibility to stamp it out
no

temp banning cy
fuck
i saw it coming but i didn't expect it
woc i want you to think about the larger context of me seeing you post that joke
i'm mildly annoyed by cy posting her joke and then you come in with your usual lit is bad bullshit
"it looks like this"
then robot ass is on my screen, while "spin me right round" is fuckign exploding in my eardrums at 100 decibels
i am having just the dandiest time
IT MUST BE
you know what, fuck it
it's time for me to actually start reading achewood
`hey pops`
<:herecomes:737347278934900836>
holy shit
this is great
beautiful
give it up baby
what is the original thing in the episode where hugh neutron flicks the quarter into the juke box
what happens
it haunts me, woc
woc this song is making me smile like a fucking idiot
SURE DOES
I JUST OILED IT
yeah no
we vowed to stop this
i'm sorry gnawms but you're going in the corner
see you tomorrow
now to finish this philippe song
achewood server when
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
well yeah of course
the actual construction of the video is just fucking absurd
it's absolutely monstrous
that's why it's great, and terrible
it's one of those rare things that's funnier to consider how it exists in the first place than to just experience it at all
look
i enjoy these memes as much as all of you
the hugh neutron shit in particular just sets me off
but we've been getting worse for a while
it's time to get back to what really matters
+progress
and also angrily shouting at each other about canonicity
yeah i'm like four picoseconds away from doing it again tbh
let me read achewood in peace
i have nuke codes and anti nuke codes and anti-anti nuke codes
achewood is great


classic philippe indeed
i won't post snippets like this though, not anymore
i refuse to become woc
i'm immediately reminded of why i liked this though
there's a very casual but consistent continuity with this comic
everything fits together but it's not like a strict linear story either
there's something rather whimsical to it
meh
trolley problems are so last year
we're all about economic frameworks and politics now
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
holy SHIT

this is turning into an entire AU
i shoot pretzel sticks from my fingers
i can summon a baguette in my hands whenever i want, of any size
also that mcaffee tweet is like a comedy in four sentences
hm
never heard of blaseball
marble league though, pretty fun
also what exactly is the fan lore that's been popping up about hiveswap
or did i misread that
yeah nevermind, i want no part in this
<:ree:475542526791516170>
bweeeeeee
what a world
what's the over/under on homestuck2 being outright deleted because the authors don't want to be associated with it
that's the thing that gets me most about it
i mean, aside from the fact that they're fundamentally arguing against qualities of their source material
pip is arguing that if we internalize their disappointing news enough, it won't actually be all that disappointing
which is like telling your serfs that if they get used to having less food, they won't feel quite so hungry
<:pathetic:431861336943886336>
i don't know if it's that precisely lat
when i was still in aysha's personal server, many times they talked about the fact that they would specifically hire their friends over outside applicants because they "worked better with people they knew"
cut to today
to be completely clear, i think it's fine, even great, to become friends with your coworkers
but you should not ever give priority to people you know over others, unless you have an EXTREMELY good reason for believing that your friend's work would be much better than other people
lmao
resident transformers expert wadapan on the scene
game design is my passion
makin getting tired of streaming things, sad!
what's your platform
boooo
the only running makin is doing is with dogs
you just don't get it makin
and you never _will_ get it
it's either dead or it's not, the truth will be revealed in a couple weeks
what, are they only doing one update
i guess that's what happens when you hire unstable, unethical workers who spend their time harassing the fandom instead of producing content
no, it's one update per month unless they have over 2000 patrons, then it's 2 updates per month
oh of course andrew
i'd prefer to be having a supportive conversation where we talk about how well WP is doing and how our relationship with them is burgeoning
unfortunately this is the reality we're saddled with instead
no
we might be able to make a better homestuck 2 IF we decided to completely toss the current plotline and do something different
as it is, what we're working with seems rather aimless and there's still no clear idea of what goal there is
okay this is getting weird, abandon conversation
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
i look at homestuck like a child
i love homestuck, but i hate the things it does
what it's become
i'm late because i was cleaning up stuff, but to answer mines' question, no we don't want to be associated with WP in any fashion after this
no, we kind of did cy
i had personally been working towards restoring relationships with them, as had a number of us
we were mistaken in thinking that previous rocky interactions were due to misunderstandings, instead of WP and hussie being actively shitty people
i'm moving past the semantics discussion, by "associated with" what i mean precisely is "able to coordinate with them on things rather than having an extensive cold war"
now stop
latter
or, well
i think we're discussing this as a result of getting absolutely no news about homestuck 2 yet
then it turned into "why is WP incompetent" which turned into "why is WP unethical and problematic"
depends on how the sauce is burnt tbh
if it's like, caramelized
that's great
so? you're the one who has to make the pizza, you automatically lose
you like making pizza? weirdo
do we know what happened yet
that's fucking insane
god, watching that footage again
that explosion is fucking terrifying
that's not water going in the air, that's the concussive blast increasing pressure so much in front of it that it causes water vapor to condensate
jesus christ
i wonder what the aftermath looks like from an aerial view
there were some tall buildings right next to the epicenter
it's unexplained as yet i think
ammonium nitrate isn't that bad i think
definitely not something you want to ingest or breathe in of course, but it's not going to immediately kill them
yes <:Chad:452496847173451776>
ammonium nitrate by itself is rather stable and won't explosively decompose until it reaches a temperature of 410 F
yeah, see, it's already specified that the ammonium nitrate exploded because a nearby fire caused fireworks to hit the fertilizer
yeah, tianjin
nitrocellulose nearby spontaneously combusted and hit the ammonium nitrate stockpile
why not
i had totally forgotten about that gnawms
ain't life grand
just add it to the pile of bullshit that's wrong here

i'm starting to hit a critical threshold of getting fucking redpilled on american conservatives
i'm just thinking about the covid pandemic and how america is hamstringing itself, and how that's due in large part to how conservatives are downplaying the seriousness of the pandemic

my own relatives are just fucking insane about it

<@!207991389613457408> i think it's finally happened

it is time to do New Thingsa
and top of the list is higurashi
prepare yourself
what's going on with mugen
<:Thinkxel:354540054087204874>
what does it mean to be satanpilled
i was going to say
for anyone who isn't religious that's just a free candy bar
i'm pretty sure the concept of the soul is common in most if not all religions
paganism seems to be catching on somewhat recently
good to see a return to The Olde Ways
the trinity is conceptually dumb
well yeah that's kind of the deal qweq
they're all part of the same pizza, but each part of the pizza has different stuff on it
that's literally the point
yeah
so we're all on the same page
okay so
what i'm getting from descriptions i'm finding online is that
God the Father comes first and is the conceptual entity referenced in basically all of the old testament
then of course God the Son is just jesus
and apparently the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Ghost as it used to be called, is "God the Father's influence as breathed through God's son"
which makes NO fucking sense
but none of this does, so whatever
it consists of a lot of holy doctrines taken from various times in history
the chapters of the old testament were collected over like 600 years from various regions of eurasia
one of the things i admire about islam is their fierce dedication to the preservation of their texts
right after they committed to the quran to writing, they made it religious law not to alter the text through mistranslations or whatever bullshit
unfortunately this also gave rise to sects who also refuse to recontextualize the lessons for more modern settings
but christianity has that too so who cares
shintoism
whichever one gave rise to the pentecostals
pentecostals are fucking weird
hearing people speak in tongues is a profoundly unnerving experience if you don't know what to expect
i don't want to sound like le fedora atheist but i almost felt kind of embarrassed when i witnessed it?
like, "this is just absurd"

higurashi will be getting most of my time first though
never at this point

i can do iconoclasts after i get done with higurashi

seeing as it's swiftly ballooning into this monstrously big thing
i made a deal with misha
misha is the only other person on this planet who has heard of eloze and mildly cares about it
it's been a while since he's read it though
i'm reading through higurashi and if i do that, he'll also read through eloze AND he'll give me advice/critiques on the continuation i'm doing for it
i'm lamenting my absolute shite internet
but i'm taking it as a sign to start new things instead of constantly dwelling on the old
finally gonna start reading higurashi proper tonight
just printing off some documents i need to get my new state ID
and cooking a brisket
<a:monkaSWTF:466062925615071252>
ell-oh-zee
yeah no kidding
it's amazing how insular this fucking fanfic is
i pic
ard
holy fucking hell
as of that screencap the guy had listened to the song for a cumulative of 3881.7 hours, or over 161 days
and that was six years ago
excuse me
yeah, i'm good
<a:kermitnod:440188350058594324>
speaking of RLM that newest reView where they just talk about TNG eps is fucking great
i can't wait for the other parts of that to come out
anyway, time for higurashi
britposters stay
i want more
not right now
i'm playing a weeby VN
<@!207991389613457408> okay, i just got done with chapter 7 where ||rena is apparently some kind of fucking demon|| and i'm sufficiently spooked
like, genuinely kinda creeped out and increasingly feel like i want to see where this goes
nice
delta rune full game when
remi
that little fucker's been in scraps before, you can see it
the other one--i can't even remember his name--is a fucking nerd and would die in three seconds
time will tell if i can get through this
it just seems that it takes forever to get to the point
why do people keep saying that
i still haven't been given a solid reason
that's not wheelspinning means you damn fool
also i'm not complaining about the VN, i'm complaining about how hard it is for me to get into VNs in general
i'm not usually a fan of this shit
but i finally hit SOME KIND of hook
REEEEEEEE
YOU'RE BOTH INSUFFERABLY REEEEEEEEEEEEE
why not
lower decks
hey pops
D O   Y O U   W A N T   S O M E    F R I T T A T A ?

this is perfect
the idea of turning this place into an achewood server feels less like a joke with every strip i read
i was kidding
cease this nonsense
see that's a much funnier idea
i can even rename myself Hugh Neutron and make my avatar that fucking image
holy shit
i tried to upload an image of hugh neutron's face and discord tagged it as NSFW <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

this one in particular
i guess it thought his lips were a fucking vagina
no
terrible

that is a fucking lovely dog
reminds me of my australian shepherd
he was so energetic
we're due for a heat wave here to
last few days have been record lows, but the rest of this week is forecast to be fucking miserable
a perfect time to stay in and experience ALL THESE NEW THINGS
WATCH A DIFFERENT MOVIE
we learned about this yesterday
so the raid was definitely conducted as a part of his looting and the party? that's fair, if less exciting than i was hoping
i kind of wanted him to turn out to be a crazy drug dealer
oh wait no
it says that the precise nature of the investigation cannot be confirmed
so basically w don't know
but apparently they were taking multiple guns out of his house
some really thonk shit
yeah well your face is about to post new info on my _fist_
nothing, it's just something an old friend used to say
twisting a current topic to be about getting punched in the face
it feels like we've been experiencing something of a renaissance with the older meme formats
that could be the sleep deprivation talking
At this point it's just a meme llf
But it also does feel like you pop your head in only rarely
I mean, isn't it established that there are multiple Dimensions or universes that you can go to in the Star Trek universe
Why not just have the crew of the Enterprise pop into universe A and then back out before the condesce wer ks their shit
I wonder how the mirror universe manages to function
You'd think a society made mostly of evil people would just fucking collapse immediately
oh, so it's a saltybets sort of deal
i could go for that depending on what the gameplay is like
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
finally
oh boy
well
```These questions are often better left open to individual interpretation and can give the one interpreting a sense of ownership of the story.``` oh fucking christ they're still pushing this

no i actually kind of enjoyed the flash
it was used appropriately even if it was short
i wish they would do more of this kind of thing more frequently
i'm honestly surprised that i didn't mind this update that much
congratulations WP you're going back in the right direction
sort of
it won't last, why am i trying
i was referring to the reasonable, clever use of flash animation mostly
the dialogue was also serviceable, in that it was fun to reda
it went on way too long though
that's pretty typical for this story though, is sophist wankery
jamie is correct
slow mode ACTIVATE
i would say this is about as boring or slightly less boring than every other update so far
lmao, true
i'm not the only one right
these gifs are choppy
https://www.homestuck2.com/assets/panels/0279.gif
i'm mostly referring to the fact that the lemon disappears out of her hand and then instantaneously appears cut in twain
i mean, i'm not posting it as some kind of gotcha like "THIS UPDATE SUCKS BECAUSE OF THIS"
it's just weird
the cinnamon toast crunch thing is perfectly acceptable
that meme is almost as old as i am
jorts and woke and hoes mad is definitely author's vernacular poking through though
i mean, dated references aren't something that break the comic, they're more just kind of dumb?
i would be more comfortable with them if they were inserted more cleverly or subtly
i'm pretty sure dave obliquely mentioned irl shit that was happening contemporaneously while on the meteor, but it wasn't word for word/exactly what the real life thing was, it was just him being pensive
i might be misremembering though
OH BOY the reports are starting to fill up my reddit mod mail inbox WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
i was exaggerating, it's just one so far
mod mail usually isn't that bad unless you get two people who are in a fucking flame war against each other
this time it's just some bitch complaining about june
you mean like an update?
nowhere in site
hehe
but no i haven't written hardly anything down
i briefly considered covering b3es departure but i'm too depressed
didn't feel like he fit in here
removed comment: `It‚Äôll be fun to see June show up in ^ 2 and shut you coomers up`

delightful
peace out

i just learned how to fly fish today and it's so fun
also yeah go ahead
i think i'm ready to begin my journey to becoming a redneck hick
miserable, moonshine tastes like sweaty fucking socks

i DID
i said go ahead you fuck
in fact, do it right now or you're banned
hm
this feels worse to look at than i expected
but i gave you my word
you might want to put a small disclaimer in your custom status, just in case people get offended
Jeb!
<@!207991389613457408> i gotta give higurashi credit
i finished chapter 12? 13? last night after shit starts going down finally, and tonight while i was fishing the cicadas started sounding off real loud and i got chills down my spine for a second
very interesting shit

i want to be present for the next time this happens
i was busy almost falling asleep and trying to finish this chapter of higurashi
HOLY SHIT GUYS
LOOK
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
it is
it definitely is

no, i think he wants to make the streams saturday only
which i'll accept, we've been doing streams like fucking crazy
the only thing i had at the barcade was sangria
and it was nice
hell of sweet
you know it baybee
most of the time
has mixed results outside of the country though
what's a guy gotta do to get a little sangria 'round here
nooo
<a:blair:424571787372658708>

THREE
YEARS
ODA
nothing will top this, possibly ever
it is a mystery to everyone
i might actually be able to watch this time, give me a bit
oda left because he didn't agree with how we treated politically charged topics, and especially race
i forget details at this point but i'm pretty sure that he fundamentally disagreed with our loose consensus that anything should be able to be discussed on an academic, clinical basis
right, saying this is making some of my neurons jog a bit
we were talking about whether it should be appropriate to discuss the N-word in any context whatsoever
oda's argument was basically "no, you can literally never say that"
unless you're actually black or something
yeah basically
oda presented an article as evidence of why their position was correct, but it wasn't terribly compelling
it was an op ed written at a college newspaper
specifically, it was written at virginia tech
i had a copy of the newspaper that op ed was written in
no one reads that newspaper
well, it's not little to oda
they care very much about it
we just didn't feel the same way
it happens sometimes
splash image??
if someone can find a splash image of similar quality with neutral character colorings then by all means, link it to me
don't be dumbasses, just find a different splash image
who are we talking about all of a sudden
a miserable little pile of challenges
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
yeah i'm waiting for some reason to hop on my computer to see misha's stream
i don't know why, i just don't want to get up
carl pls
take care of yourself friend
you deserve death
i need an icon for drunk linky, to indicate when i have been celebrating without being too overt about it
someone, please, get on this
that's the point, numbskull
do you feel menaced yet

GIRAFFES
HABEEB IT
i probably went a bit too hard tonight
i don't know, i think i've been doing alright
just pounded myself in the head a bit
did i ever tell y'all about the time i went to omaha nebraska and there was a restaurant where they fed the leftovers of patrons to a pack of wild raccoons
yes
but no, they would just toss the waste of meals out into the forest in the backyard, and a dozen raccoons would come out and devour it
i took a few pictures of them
it was honesty a pretty decent place, food was good and the raccoons were cute
as cute as wild animals can be anyway
yes, they had a wide open balcony where you could view the raccoons from a giant window
there was a small clearing so you could see them climb up onto the patio or up a tree to get to the leftovers being tossed out of the cabin\\
pretty fun place
lots of annoying children though
the former
each time i see this bam, i get more excited
it looks great
<:kramerGiddyup:663992118955737099>
well, this'll be interesting
yeah that last part made me do a doubletake, it feels like it came out of nowhere
le monke?
no
chimpanzees have 24 pairs of chromosomes, humans have 23 pairs
genetically incompatible
genetics is really fucking complicated
yeah, hybridization is possible but it leads to poor rates of fertility
no, no, i meant with horses specifically
it's not possible to make a human chump hybrid
the genetics are different
it's kind of like how dogs and cats can create hybrids with members of their own species

hm
i'm looking up the information again and i think the closest answer to "can we make a humanzee" is "we don't know"
no
makin, shut up
i know more than you
the fertilization process and genetic structure are very particular but not concrete
there are glycoproteins on the surface of mammalian eggs that will only let in specific sperm, but they could be coaxed to let in abnormal sperm OR you could inject the egg directly
the other problem is that often there's genetic machinery that "expects" to see a specific number of chromosomes, and if it looks off it'll initiate apoptosis
if you were to bypass both of those things, then the rest of the question is "what would the hybrid look like"
it could be a decent amalgamation of both species but there's also a possibility that it would be self-abortive through completely fucked up physiology
i think it's good for like comparative purposes
there's something that's still engaging enough about the original half-life
if you play black mesa first you could literally not stand playing the original though
<:robotass:737043838761304084>
BOO TO THAT
achewood posting will be the next golden age of this channel
no one should ever subject themselves to TESDOS
i'm also not really a fan of oblivion, but at least oblivion is actually _playable_
29C is about 85 F
uncomfortable hot sounds about right
it's actually 29C here right now, this is a pretty low day at this time of year actually
hahaha, oh man
you are fucked
i like my winters like my women: unapologetically cold, so cold that i'm perpetually wrapped in a blanket so i don't succumb to the pain
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<:aaaaaa:413935649452982282>
bee and puppycat
the first few episodes are great
it hits a rough patch in the middle but then the end is pretty cool too
it wasn't a flop per se, it's just entirely independently made, so it took a long time and people lost interest
first season is completely done but i haven't seen anything about continuing it
yeah, precisely
it may be that the zeitgeist for that was just really shortlived
quirky independent animated cartoons
adventure time enjoyed several years of being The Quirky Cartoon and once it was done i think people were ready for something else
nah bravest warriors is okay
the beginning sucked but as soon as the characters were established i enjoyed it plenty
it's just fucking _slow_ to produce episodes
there's nothing wrong with gas powered stick as a one time gag
it's when they overuse it that it's bad
don't get uppity you fucks
what, did you watch it like four billion times
don't be racist
<@!165162590878695424> WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY WATCHING IT YOU DINK
GET BACK IN HERE
it happens sometimes
fuck, this is great
<@!111477124384202752> we're done with maury come back in
anime is fucking borked we're just doing misfits
it's bucking you like a bull
hello dr nick
how can we help you this fine day
yes
what the hell
say that to my fuckin face irl
what's the matter bam
it's the paradox space comic
apropos of nothing, i'm reminded of something i saw today
i was purchasing a fishing license which is always right next to the gun locker in walmart
above the locker there was a sign of "three important things to remember"
1. Follow the law. Don't be a straw!
2. Avoid the crime and the time.
3. You are on camera.
i was caught off guard so badly by how blunt the last one was compared to the dumb rhymes
very good, i will look at this soon
you're very based
not
what in the fuck is that
like, some kind of soup
just completely laying into marmaduke
<:thinkLoss:534542697634201600>
i guess the majority of people are just asleep right now
i haven't seen the mod list so sparse in a while
i started the second chapter of higurashi
with the way the first chapter ended i am confused and very hesitant
i think the deal is i hvae to complete at least two chapters of this
but i think i'm genuinely getting interested
edgy keiichi-san
i was thinking about andrew's cursed as fuck drink of choice
i'm pretty sure alcohol curdles milk, doesn't it
the incident was four years ago
also misha i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop at this point
how long must i go along with whatever fucked up pretense the beginning of this episode is
kornheiserwhy.jpg
the issue is your tissue
alright i'm finally finished with those errands
what'd i miss today, anything good
that sounds unfortunate
OH SHIT THAT'S RIGHT
i am so fucking hype for WTC
now THAT'S an idea
oh yes, okay
just refreshed myself on the ending of the last section, i'm excited for what comes next
hopefully we get a resolution to this plotline, we've been on it for like a year now i think
when did ||they first talk to the dragons on the isle of poran||
i meant the real life time, yes carl
let me check
indeed, 170
i don't think i've ever been to his website, what is it
are you being snippy at me
oh yeah
tomorrow i'll take pictures of my dog mocha
she just got groomed at the vet so she's all short-haired and everything
she's great
also, have a picture of my giant sequoia seedling that just started growing leaves today
taking care of old dog
it WAS

giant sequoias have a very low germination rate, something like 5%
if you want to get a couple to sprout, you have to just take a shit ton and dump them into soil
out of the around 40-50 or so that i threw into the pot, about 2 or 3 have actually managed to turn into seedlings
that's the beginnings of one of those fucking enormous things out in the californian mountains
i'm so excited
also lmao the current plotline in WTC started literally a year ago, dragons on poran first happened on august 15th 2019
actually they grow pretty quickly
if i can keep these seedlings from dying, they'll reach about 30 feet tall in less than 10 year
they'll reach full maturity at around 80-90 years thoguh you're right
i'm hoping that the ones i'm growing now will be able to outgrow the chance of infection from fungus
apparently in moist, warm habitats they're really susceptible to fungal pathogens
but once they reach a certain size they're basically untouchable
you got it carl
that's fucking intense
in 1930? i'm sure it would have worked too
bad dog
imagine lifting a 40 pound weight with your teeth
no
i mean, yes, you could, but it would almost definitely cause some kind of damage
lat, i've literally worked out with 40 pound dumbbells before
i'm a big fucking guy, i'm 6'3 and about 285 pounds
lifting 40 pounds with one arm is fucking _hard_
doing it with your teeth is like
n-no
most of that tension and stress is going to be on your neck
well how the fuck else are you gonna do it
lmao yeah
before you start doing shit like lifting _40 pounds_ with your head, try 10 pounds first
a gallon of water is about that, give or take
do not strain yourself or you could pull muscles in your neck and back really bad
this is one of the dumbest things i've ever played witness to in here
i can't wait to see the video
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
hold on, hold on
if we're going to start a bet over this
we need to rigorously define what the challenge is
so what exactly is lat doing
the goal is to lift 40 pounds with his teeth but what does that mean
and then what, tilting your chin up?
that's not lifting 40 pounds with your teeth, that's lifting 40 pounds using your legs and holding it in your mouth
not the same thing
that's not what's happening in that gif though, this conversation sprung from looking at this hulked out dog carrying 30 pounds in his mouth
he didn't lift that up using his legs
he lifted it using his neck muscles
that is also impressive yes
you know what though okay
lat, how about this
the challenge will be: put the strap in your mouth, and then successfully close your jaw while the weight is suspended, then go from a squat to a standing position as you descried
i think that's a fine combination of what we're both talking about
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
but no you really should try it with only a gallon of water first
if that's easy then upgrade to 20 pounds, then increase at 5 pound increments
look canis, i don't condone buffoonery, i'm just telling lat how to be a buffoon right if he's so intent on doing it
<:thinkingCeption:304455724669599748>
what would be acceptable stakes for this, is a good question
what glory can i foist upon a hapless user in this server
canis that's not what that means
or i mean, it's not what you think
biting force is about combing pressure of your bottom and top jaws coming together and your teeth putting pressure on stuff
i'm pretty sure that's different from the muscle strength in your lower jaw
i went to type "muscle strength" in google and ended up typing "muscle grape" instead, thanks misha
i'm considering that
on the other hand, what do you offer us if  you lose
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
andrew, try out the gallon thing and let me know how it goes
fair enough, fair enough
<@!111477124384202752> i command you to keep the results to yourself
SH
STOP
ANDREW NO
we don't need to know
you'll ruin the _mystique_
it's a knife chicken
yeah i knew it would be a chicken
<@!200033159553875979> settle down a bit, you're shitposting just a wee bit hard
i know, sorry
let's see
a channel of lat's own for two weeks
versus 20 bucks
yes
i would put that 20 bucks into a pot to commission a new splash image
i think this is worth it
you have a deal
THE TRANSACTION IS WRITTEN IN BLOOD
yeah this is where all the losers hang out so we fuck about more often
we usually end up circlejerking about literature though
well, if you're interested in what we read, our list of shills is up in the channel description
we're especially excited about the ongoing work Worth the Candle, which is updating very soon
oh yeah i disabled plebs, one second
have at 'em
no, but hopefully soon
it's more or less acceptably used here
i'm also interested in learning about the fandom's make up
it's 11 pounds
your brain itself is 3 pounds, most of the weight is in bone and liquid
rock the casbah?
get some culture inya https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ9r8LMU9bQ
i don't get it, what's the problem
poor craig
it at least doesn't look like it'll be another halo 5
it's kind of nuts how halo 1-3 was a span of like, what, 6 years?
pissposters OUT
<:EverybodyOut:230488183467409408>
halo's tenure as a video game series
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i don't know if i agree with that
i mean, if you're saying "there's no way sequels were viable in the first place" then you're wrong, sequels can always be a success if they're done right
the magic right now is determining if i'm talking about halo or homestuck
that's a pretty good take, althoguh i will say that most of the mechanics had set in by halo 2 and halo 3 was basically just a lot of polish
the gameplay isn't really the question anymore, it's the style the game is done with i think
we've talked about this a lot in here recently and i think we've all come to the consensus that after the first trilogy was finished, they just forgot what kind of tone they were supposed to be going for with halo games
hey qweq i had a really busy day but i'm trying to make up for it now
we made a bet with furrylat that he can't lift 40 pounds with his teeth
june 20th
yeah
i got tired of halo 2 real fast but halo 3 i've actually wanted to play some levels through a few times
harpy you shold totally pick up the MCC
nyos
halo 3 is the only of the original trilogy that you can play on legendary withotu wanting to rip your own eyeballs out
CE throws some really unfair shit at you a lot of the time and 2 is legit almost impossible
oh fucking christ, getting onto the truth and reconciliation
i must have played that segment like 50 times before i managed to get through to the rest of the ship
it just throws 5 elite generals with swords at you, and they close the distance REAL fast
i'm not touching 2 legendary with a 10 foot pole
3 legendary is actually very challenging without being bullshit, which is great
yes, wait for when there are more people aroudn to witness you eat crow
what's the kickstarter at
as if yandev wasn't enough
nutstuck*
also that's unfortunate
give us the scoop dingo
i mean, i kind of want to care, but starting off with that attitude makes it kind of hard
i can't see this validate kickstarter
it just won't load on my browser
yeah it just makes my computer shit itself
someone just tell me what their goal is and what they're at
i just want to know how the kickstarter is doing and y'all tlaking about topic appropriateness
thanks qweq
well that's pretty cool, i hope that their VN turns out well
sometimes linkybot has these moments of lucidity that frighten everyone
other times he just has robot cancer
you don't know seven degrees of kevin bacon?
dingus, i don't necessarily care for it either, but we get nothing out of this
best to let sleeping demons lie
yeah, but we shouldn't
we're trying to cut down on that a bit
i already told pissposters to get out earlier
no more vore for tonight
look at that son of a bitch
dingus banned
yo, hold up for a second though
think about the fact that, not only is homestuck over 10 years old, but all of the culture _surrounding_ homestuck is over 10 years old now too
pira tep anicll
<@!699703310625538160> delete that i don't want it on my fucking screen
get rid of it _now_
<:ree:475542526791516170>
IT MUST BE
<:robotass:737043838761304084>
GET THEIR ASS
which one dingus
someone get it
no
if any of you haven't bothered giving achewood a try, i highly recommend it
i'm just reading it through right now and it's extremely enjoyable
qweq it's like comic zen
achewood is written in a way that it feels extremely earnest for some reason
god, lyle is great
also achewood has a huge cast but arguably those are the main ones yeah
pat, lyle, roast beef, and mr. bear
er, teodor
not mr. bear
fuck, what, i meant ray
dude i'm losing my mind
lyle is the one who has the pronounced mustache
the one in thongs is ray
roast beef is the plain looking cat, and teodor is the dog looking one
little nephew is fucking great
i love when he becomes a rap star but ray hands him his ass so hard that little nephew starts bawling
harpy go read it
achewood started all the way back in 2001 and only stopped updating in 2016, and it's fucking great
goodbye newcomer
yeah qweq i have a feeling you would love philippe
he appears in a large number of them
no dingus this is definitely funny too
it's just different
it's kind of like how hamburgers and lasagna are two very different kinds of food but they're both delicious
vlad though, vlad is a fucking genius
oh fuck that reminds me woc
there was one achewood strip that actually made me laugh out loud
one second
well, shit, i wish i had shared it when i first foudn it
onstad's search function is not that great
it's in the middle of the subway wars arc
fuck, here it is https://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=02112003
oh so you guys have to copy the image, die i guess
this one fucking killed me
that last panel was just like getting suckerpunched
jesus christ
i'm not there yet
onstad why do you do this to us


we
we're like a good luck charm
he thicc
hello tera
"fye-yer"
"fy-er"
two syllables then
fire is just weird because it's spelled more simplistically, it definitely has two beats
BUT
if you try, you can compress it into one
english, mang
"why-er"
<:KEKW:632036208750624799>
it's delightful
dance, puppets
dance for my amusements
you gonna take that spiral
you could smack andrew down with a flick of your digitized hand
<:doit:350074829354958868>
it feels like we learn that less at least once every week
sometimes tori will stroll in to hang out and chat amiably for a while, sometimes tori rolls in like a typhoon and fucking destroys everything and is back out to sea just as quick
i do not thonk at you ma'am
which one was best
neither it's like 2:30
go the fuck to bed
i think i can flip a pretty decent bird
my hands are big so my middle finger looks like a fucking rocket
i don't care for this tally
it is boring
it is boring because of what's being tallied
who cares about a bunch of white guys who all look similar to each other
so what? a scarf of a particular color is also a very specific accessory and there's probably thousands upon thousands of white guys who all own that color of scarf
also are you sure they're not wearing wedding rings??
also i wear it on my right hand
the only thing that an engagement/wedding ring MUST be is on the left ring finger
everything else is mutable
alright i'll bite
someone get me a sufficient introductory video to blaseball
<:waitWhat:322151046258360322>
alright then
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> jesus
i don't want to do any work i'll look into it another time maybe
i need to make tomato basil chicken
also no i hadn't head the term dirtbag left before now
so if i'm getting this right it's basically being leftist but not against the idea of using coarse language to argue with people
how is this any different from politics in general
this channel is a bunch of things
we talk about literautre a lot, especially a number of "shills" that you can find in the channel description, and we just generally chat about stuff we find interesting, and we're also kind of a public mod hangout
it's not really
don't fill new people's impressionable heads with nonsense
we're only _sort_ of like mean girls, we're a much weirder cultural melange than that
a lot of the time we have shitposts about stuff a number of us find interesting or fun
like achewood
is it circlehating if all the reasons for hating it are completely valid
<@!547151191315054633> i know this must all be pretty confusing and overwhelming, but if you stick around it all starts to make sense
we have like a cultural learning curve
a.... filter, if you will
is there anything you do for fun or as a profession
yeah i love sifting dirt
no i was a soil microbial ecologist
the actual job is even lamer than that
but also that's pretty cool pnk,we have a bunch of people who code in here
_part time!_
what are you specializing in
do you not hve a preference for like genetics or ecology or anything
the only thing we're sponsored by is the TRUTH
that's kind of what i went into
just be careful, it's easy to get confused because the individual parts of high-level biology are so complicated that they're basically entire fields in and of themselves
i didn't even know what the fuck i was getting myself into for graduate school
i mean, they pay well if you go into an industry job, but those aren't in high demand right now
otherwise you can expect to become a teacher/researcher, and that way lies death
unless you really enjoy teaching and researching
see, here's the thing misha
they don't tell you that until it's way too late because they need warm bodies to work as slave labor and put out research at ever-increasing rates
i wonder how i would do on the ASVAB
isn't it designed for mentally deficient children
okay i feel bad about that joke
what in the hell
how did we get here
Alright everybody! It's time to see my ass!
How do you know that a robot's ass is bad?
It just looks like this
<:robotass:737043838761304084>
carlarc is turning into a living markov chain
TELLING YOU, THIS LIGHT
jjjj
finally done cleaning the hosue and cooking dinner and i feel complete
the satisfaction of a job well done
i hope i never have to bother again
optimally _no one_ would have to bother with menial tasks again
that's my singularity
all suffering, strife, and menial labor done away with forever, for all people
it's more that
my grandparents have been really bad about taking care of their house ever since she started deteriorating
i've been away for over three years so i've been blind/ignorant to the way they've been taking care of things
so now that i've moved in i keep finding things that are just completely revolting and i'm basically cleaning the place from top to bottom
i managed to get it into a properly livable state before i actually moved in, but there are lots of little things i'm taking care of now
absurd nonsense
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
yes of course
we told you bro
honestly the longer this goes on the more i agree that you should just not do this at all
there's a risk of serious injury to your spine
sweet
the words of a man who has no fun except tearing others down
exobiology is already a thing
probably tori
it would be an extremely big thing, almost like a counterpart to biology as we understand it
but it's still in the realm of life
so it goes under biology
yeah it's pretty funky to wrap our minds around
star trek TOS already did a plotline about life that's not carbon based, it had a silicon based organism in one of its episodes
i really like that
well, no, most of the aliens encountered in star trek are still carbon based
there's a lot of humanoid aliens due to some forerunner race that seeded the galaxy with the same species that all deviated over time
<a:CRY_cool:575444868973723668>


reading this makes my brain fucking hurt
HOW CAN YOU BE ANARCHO-COMMUNIST
<@!207991389613457408> i tried dude, i'm so sorry
my internet just cannot physically handle streaming
i'll try to watch the VOD later, it does better with stuff like that for some reason
YEET that MEAT
like, in one sitting?
weaponless, huh
this is a good question
i could probably fight a mid-sized dog no problem
but if we're talking upper bounds... like, maybe a cougar? assuming it doesn't take me by surprise and me being near death is still victory
wait, biggest and not necessarily most violent? i might be able to suffocate a cow
if i can get my arm around its head and avoid getting bucked off then it's just a matter of time
dude i live off of beef
if we're talking in terms of "utilize all parts of the animal" then a cow is definitely great
SKIN DAT LETHER

protein goes directly into your fucking noggin
it makes your brain biggor
you can also make your brain bigger by violently bashing your skull into a brick wall, as many times as possible before your pass out
if you do it right then your brain will get real big real fast, but make sure it doesn't get TOO big
1) 2, 2) no
now the rest of you
that might work better, how do i get into this
yes
i have to say, the logic of having a bedframe doesn't make much sense to me
why is that more commonly accepted than boxsprings or even just mattress on the floor
is it a height thing
i'm a big guy
<a:JohnConfused:393596088445042688>
yeah i don't know why it's a thing
like, i'm comfy enough with all three but i've always wondered why
they're okay
ah, come on
i'm already unenthusiastic enough about biden as is
why do they keep hurting progressives

it's time to steal her melanin <:ree:475542526791516170>
he kind of has to, there's no mechanism for trump to stay in office past the expiration of his term unless he's reelected
secret service will simply escort him out and that's the end of it
well, if that happens it would be a further, even more striking erosion of our already pretty badly damaged system
god damn jamie, that got me good
what a fucking reality we live in
`this is a growing problem. please share.`
holy fuck my sides
i love the internet sometimes
it like barely counts as a "meme" yes
maybe that's why it got me so good, it's just so stark and weird
hoo boy
this is going to piss off progressives really hard
buttigieg is like a centrist in progressive's clothing
okay sure
i'm not talking about in terms of kamala harris not getting it though
i'm talking about... in general
quality VP pick would have been sanders
yeah, fair enough
it's just depressing dude
both pence and trump have probably already had the virus, based on reports of their staff catching it
probably just asymptomatic, our luck
apparently there was _another_ explosion today, in volgograd
really, thank you mety
it's more like a smash tournament

wait, what's going on in cedar rapids

fucking tankie linkybot
guys, please, _please_
alright everyone shut the fuck up
STOP
i almost za warudo'd just for the fuck of it
you all disgust me
FUCK
linkybot really does not give a shit about making my life harder
it's like celeste
that's fine i guess
TYPICAL
disgusting nonsense
SLAG
yeah twinks is the archaic name for twinkies
also no there are still twinkies out there
<@!168980988477702145> poop ballsack
Alright everyone! It's time to see my ass!
self-inserts have always been cringe, i thought
at least blatant ones
maybe it's just mary sues that have always been cringe
isn't the update supposed to be out for backers already
GAWD
by how much
KNOCK IT OFF
yeah if you're not a fan of D&D then like
WTC is 100% not for you, it's all about TTRPGs and how they work/how people interact with them
<@!131892666714685442> in that case nevermind, WTC is based around a fictional, novel system
D&D is mentioned in places but the system is not about it
you'll probably enjoy it then
<@!125433170047795200> i'm not in any campaigns right now besides misha's vampire campaign, but that one's on hiatus
i actually enjoy it a lot
i like warhammer fantasy and the PTU system
although PTU's combat is fucking terrible, it needs homebrew fixing
either way, i'm cautiously willing to get into another campaign depending on the circumstances
i was busy months ago
i'm talking about now
i'm gonna shop around and see what my options are
which is my way of saying your campaign/DM style STANK
just kidding i don't know anything about those
what do your current players think about how you run tabletops
i'd be willing to try pathfinder out
i don't know anything about it
i don't wnt to be a greedy mercenary though, i want to be the Ultimate Wizard
i want arcane secrets that'll allow me to cast a spell that blasts apart any foe, or entire cities if i want
or it can turn my dick into a magic wand, either or
YOU CANNOT IGNORE HIS GIRTH
IT'S OKAY
TO BE GAY
i always liked the way misha responded when i had my character say little bits and bobs
i worried i was annoying the other playrs by taking up time though
honestly they were pretty quiet often
a bit unfortunate
voice makes me feel a bit awkward but i gotta get over it
i think that voice works best with less serious campaigns
if you want to take it seriously, text only is better
when is woc watching more anime and presumably drinking
FUCK
i wanted to join in on that
i was going to mix some more kamikazes tomorrow night
oh hsit maybe then
<:ree:475542526791516170>
sure i can catch up between now and tomorrow night
wait, woc did you say you're busy and not doing the thing tomorrow night
brain blast tomorrow night it is
i'm mostly joining for the social aspect of it
the last time i got drunk with woc, i had a great time
making fun of anime while doing it is just icing on the cake
i'll let you know if i ever step near virginia again, no worries
if i do, we need to make an occasion out of it
get a bunch of people in the area involved
hsd eastern seaboard meetup mofuckas
like, a pain in my hands??
no
i've been typing like the dickens ever since i was 10, i have no kind of soreness in them at all
ha ha
laugh at the FAT KID
the fat kid is me
i like the idea that ray is just constantly smashed, to the point that it's his regular state of functioning
if he stops drinking high proof stuff he starts declining in cognitive ability
<:herecomes:737347278934900836>
BOO TO THAT

that was great you fucking reprobates
it gave me a warm fuzzy feeling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxEPV4kolz0
it's one of billy joel's best
yeah you fuckers
we didn't start the fire is a meme
yeah, it was, but this was pretty good
some of the beats just require a little finagling
i actually like singing to the piano man quite a bit, i think it's all in my vocal range, so i was already half thinking of covering it
i hate singing for other people though so probably not
find some other young and promising musician
we could fix that
a few nails, some duct tape...
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
WTC UPDATE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
yes
another joins the cause
discourse has its place
it's fun but not always
indeed
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
Yeah lmao
Not really I think
But I've never played fortnite so I dont really know
Shocking
Also I like how we successfully shilled WTC to ennemy last night by saying "it's the kind of story that explaining it always makes it seem worse than it actually is" and he got through the first few chapters and said "yeah basically"
Gottem ez
Wifi hate?
Pls no
Also I fear this election greatly
Its shrouded in so mu h unsureness

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Man, how is achewood so good
That jsnt how Stockholm syndrome works you fucking idjit
I liked achewood right from the start
Its genuinely great humor
Put achewood on the shills list
Hashtag suburban animal loving
Dang man why you got to be hell of up in my business
<@125433170047795200> WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? THE DISEASE IS INSIDE YOU!
I want to frame that and put it on my wall ifnar
Yes
did we talk about halo infinite getting delayed till 2021
y u no main scout then
he are the fatest
i'll bet on in-depth description of sexual organs over a bona fide sex scene, sure
<@!173936231229554688> when is anime night
i want to make sure i have time to watch the kamen rider stuff i missed
if it starts soon i'll do kamen rider later tonight
nice
i miss king of the hill streams
yep.
is it really that astonishing given his track record
it's still mortifying though
i don't nkow why i'm being snarky about it
it's just depressing
well then die i guess
oh boy, is it time for this conversation again
carlarc the only one thinking straight smh
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
it wasn't a rando, it was more just random
kind of weird overall
job's gone, whatcha gonna do brad
job's gone
fucking lightning storms
i'm drunk so you better make your case extremely clear, extremely quick
what is going on
unless the situation is explained to a satisfactory degree, someone is getting banned in five minutes
<:ree:475542526791516170>
yeah i think i agree
multi you're being kind of a nincompoop who doesn't understand the concept of nuance
creating a center for people who are trying to flee mexico but don't have legal citizenship isn't the same as creating a detention center where you can unethically hold immigrants who have done nothing wrong
don't be an asshole
also yes, swish you phrase your arguments like absolute shit
don't be a fucking dick
does it feel good to be free of the curse of deus ex, misha
oh shit that's cool
but there are many types of barbarians <:THONKeng:386532084790984727>
holy shit where
space dandy is fun
i think i'm just now getting my cognizance back though
i quoted achewood like three times inappropriately during the stream and i don't even care
time to see my ass
how do you know a discord admin's ass is bad
it looks like this <:HYPERMEGAULTRAOMEGAGODLUL:350524757109899265>
uininn
i was going to say
i have a pentium processor in my machine right now but isn't intel shitting the bed something fierce lately
i should have bought puts on them when that guy posted on /r/wallstreetbets
hindsight is 20/20 i guess
also someone mentioned you aren't a he today, is that true
yeah, i don't want to misgender you
i brought you up earlier
look i'm drunk, just humor me
alright just making sure
nat i know everything
you don't even know what all i know
thanks for clarifying ennemy
but nat is a stinky
dare me motherfucker
DOUBLE DOG DARE ME
just go to sleep there's no need to thank me
i just want to do right by my PEEPS
what is the moron part
that is indeed moronic
do something better with your time, like blowing farts through a trombone
who is that, virgil?
hm
not really
my gf is though
quite literally goth gf
but i'm a nerd
51 already? holy shit
you're already past what any of us consider bad, just keep at it
jkmop,lkmonujimok
i'm trying to rip my sanity back from the void
what does it mean to "be goth"
awful
which one
what the fuck
you mean from dark souls???
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
WHY FIND OUT
ennemy, i dont know how much sway my opinion has
btu hollow knight is one of the two games i have ever felt compelled to 100%
at least since i became an adult
no i mean i 100%ed it achievement ways
lmao, fair enough ennemy
there's a lot of stuff we all generally enjoy
it's hard not to be like "OH YEAH LOOK AT THIS" at any given time
uijom
++++++++++++++
i'm readying achewood
we have a black cat named ace and a mutt shepherd dog named mocha
neither are my pets but i take care of them all the same
let me see
mocha is a rescue from an abusive household and i've been meaning to try and show her some more love and care as time goes by
she's very sweet
nah
she trusts me a lot more than at first but there's still a ways to go
want to get her to the point that she feels alright sleeping nearby, but she's still skittish at night
i'll work on it tomorrow
thefollyofman.jpg
it is less the frequency and more the style of asking
eventually, but not right this moment
im basically incapable of it
uhhhhh
how
literally no
i think the words cringe and based have both caused more harm to discourse in here than any other terms, ever
they completely undercut any attempts to actually explain why something might fit those classifications and are also shitty memes
i'm banning them
no one may use the words cringe or based anymore
under penalty of death
lat mspa banned for six hours
IT'S TOO LATE HB
I SAW IT
YOU CAN'T HIDE WHAT'S INSIDE
i need to get into using woc's fancy thingamajig
let me find an example of its usage
fine but seriously, no more based or cringe anymore
i'm tired of hearing that shit so much
i'm still thinking about it
no i need to test the function out
here goes nothing
that's fucking cool
now we see whether it's automatically undone when the time comes
oh, you have to do it yourself
well, fair enough
yes spiral
please, please do it
i'm tired of seeing it
it's fucking devoid of substance
nihilism-posting is also banned for being self-defeating
careful, icarus
we can and frequently do both of those tm, you're just being a fucking weiener
get over yourself
no, i really don't tm
the vision is "preventing it from teetering too far in one direction or another"
you've made the classic mistake of assuming that my mandates are proactive instead of reactive
i have no interest in actively shaping this channel or directing it one way or another
i just want to make it more stable
that's where you're wrong kiddo
and i'm going to show it to you RIGHT
NOW
that would have been funny but probably a bit too ballsy for me, i don't enjoy server banning people for even a joke
good heavens
<@!736140696414715924> this place is kind of a weird mix of stuff
we're an unofficial public mod hangout, we talk about literature especially as listed in the channel description, and we talk about fandom drama a lot
there ar eother things too
<@125433170047795200> my reason for not doing it is because its fucking stupid
Not even remotely the same thing
Based/cringed is a conversational pox because they're a shorthand for "I agree/disagree with this," which is ITSELF already a problem in discussions
Someone saying hello or hi is not a problem IF they continue talking afterwards
If you want to write a script to get rid of anyone who says hello and nothing else for an arbitrary period of time no less than a month, then be my guest
Otherwise the next time we meet up irl I will wrestle you into next fucking week
i'm not convinced that people exchanging greetings, something that's enshrined in practically every single human culture in existence, is something that by itself requires intervention and prevention
like i said, if you want to get rid of someone who says "hi" and LITERALLY nothing else for x amount of time, then sure
because they're basically dead weight
but just people saying "hey what's going on" and then going into the conversation should not be punished, and if you think otherwise then i'd say you have deeper sociological issues than what we're discussing right now
we're not even that busy half the time
you're full of shit because previous communities and chats i've been a part of were precisely as large as this group is in terms of participants at a given time, and we were fine with helloposting
it's not a matter of participants, it's a matter of conversational speed
if it's genuinely interruptive then sure, i agree
but if chat is dead then fuck you, it's fine
no they're _not_ you fucking cro magnon
it's useful as social pretext to real conversation you absolute cock meister
AGAIN
and listen to me real closely
because this is the last time i'm going to fucking say it
if they go on to actually say substantive stuff? there's nothing wrong with helloposting
if they ONLY say hello and nothing else then it's evil
i'll have no more of this utter tripe from you
DUDE
THAT LITERALLY FALLS UNDER WHAT I WAS SAYING
i'm going to fucking strangle you through the force of my sheer rage
i hope you can feel the ghost of my anger floating down to richmond because it's going to wrap its ethereal hands arounds your neck and throttle you within an inch of your vexatious life
<:UNRELENTINGTRASH:456927328929316865>
YOU ALL SEE WHAT I MEAN
THIS IS FUCKING INANE
i'm specifically _not_ enabling it
i explicitly do not sanction the script that woc is describing in this form
if he takes issue with that he can suck my farts hashtag NOT a brappost
i already explained the difference between what we're talking about now, ie brief greetings before talking, and based/cringe
you are being a pedantic troglodyte and it infuriates me to no end
not pedantic, actually, you're being reductive, which is twice as bad
SLIPPERY SLOPE FALLACY BLUG BLUH
CRINGE CRINGE BASED CRINGE
WOC'S IDEA FOR BANNING HELLOPOSTING IS PRETTY CRINGE GUYS I DUNNO
<:iwasonlypretending:725434889662496930>
woc this isnt me being drunk, i sobered up half an hour ago, this is me getting pissed off because you're being intellectually dishonest and trying to conflate me getting tired of something that is ACTUALLY vapid and doesn't contribute anything to discussion versus something that is merely a precursor to actual discussion
if you could pull your head out of your fucking decrepit ass for four seconds you would understand the nuance i'm talking about
someone posting "cringe/based" with nothing else is absolutely ridiculous and sholdn't be allowed
as i have said NUMEROUS times in this conversation, someone posting "hi/hello" and nothing else is ALSO bad
i'm not opposed to someone saying "based/cringe" as long as they follow it up with an explanation for why they're fucking saying that
i also do not want to get rid of people just for saying "hello/hi" and then launching into the conversation proper
do you understand what i'm saying, yes or no
cy don't we _already_ yell at people for not contributing anything of value to discussions, and especially hellposting
this is just a long time coming if you ask me
and i'm starting my ban spree with YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
no not really
what
i'm not actually banning cringe/based
where's that achewood comic where ray basically says "i'm a hypocrite"
anyway shut the fuck up
i don't want to hear your snarky nonsense
me banning lat was more of a test of the ban command, which i really need to start using over just manually banning people
you already yelled at me--appropriately--in mod chat for joke bans
i also don't think joke bans are good, i was still inebriated when i bajingoed lat and tm
i also don't care if you don't care what i want to hear, you are a wiener and i'm the dear leader of this channel/server so what i say goes
now eat grass and build nukes in underground bunkers for me until your pathetic little spines give out
my magnificent corpulence isn't going to maintain itself
you can't cy, because i said that while i was still inebriated
again, i'm not inebriated now and i'm not actually going to ban cringe/based AS MUCH AS I MIGHT WANT TO
also yeah i was actually just about to unban lat, i'm still disappointed it's not an auto-unban but i guess i can't have anything
i already DID IT
holy fucking shit i'm actually starting to seethe
get off my back
YOU ARE NOT MY MOTHER
what did jake do exactly
you realize i've been excessively busy the last month right
i forget things
hm
strictly speaking i really shouldn't be here at all when i'm drinking
there's too many younguns
and also it's kind of pathetic
well, that's the thing
me doing administrative or moderative actions while being here is kind of an intrinsic thing
it's an ingrained feature of being here at this point
so what should i do, make an alt account for when i'm partying
alright we're getting distracted, shut up
cy part of the problem here is that i'm not very good at conveying sarcasm when i'm under the influence
i'm kind of miffed that this blew up into such a big deal because i thought it was more clear than it really was that i wasn't actually going to ban cringe/based posting
i do think it's kind of stupid to say nothing but cringe/based but whatever, y'know
i already came clean about jokebanning when i shouldn't have, so the rest of this is just kind of the detritus of unnecessary discourse
my justification of what, trying and failing to convey that i'm not actually banning an innocuous if annoying behavior
okay, but i wasn't actually making a concrete moderation decision is what i'm telling you
and yes yes i know backtracking/covering my ass but that's the truth
no, see, again
that's part of what i mean about "failing to convey that i'm joking"
christ this is the most moronic discourse
then it would probably come up later and i would be like "whoa wait dude i'm sorry i misled you but i was fucking around and didn't actually mean that, do not do it anymore"
we don't live in a world where verbal statements are unretractable or immutable
cy is making a point that moderation and administrative decisions conducted while under the influence are very bad, which is completely correct
and
yeah, basically that bones
well this was a really frustrating way to spend my last free night for the next couple of days
yeah, please get us away from this miserable nonsense tera
<:facepalm:481661272849645579> where did i go wrong
go ahead bones i need to excise this evil from my body
that was terrible, get rid of it
you do or you don't, cy
tonight was frustrating, i think i've relearned the lesson that i don't understand humor/people as well as i thought
either that or i'm just more of a dick than i thought
either way, not comfy
also my catchphrase is ||                                      üêî                                            ||
i appreciate that guys, i just worry that i try too hard sometimes
i'm tired
it's been a rough couple of weeks, i'll be better another time probably
this isn't me fishing for support, i'm just frazzled i guess
also vinny from vinesauce screaming in my fucking ear drums
ohnoghost.jpg
he's saying it's at odds with ||Same with Tommul. I could have let him live. ||
||saying "this didn't need to happen" and "this is necessary" are indeed contradictory ideas||
no, hold on
i agree with you, i understand where you're coming from
i'm just saying that you're acting like this is coming way out of left field
andrew's not that off base for getting this impression, he's just dumb for taking it this far
who cares if dante's teacher was gay
no, not exactly
far more interesting is the political implication at the time, which is that brunetto latini had committed a great wrong before his rise to the front of florentine politics but had spent his entire life trying to correct that error
well, seems my information is outdated anyway too
it's probably "all of the above" because dante's inferno is pretty well-steeped in nuance
```Other critics point to the fact that, outside of the Divine Comedy, there are no firm historical records suggesting Latini was accused of sodomy or homosexual relations‚Äîand indeed he seemingly condemns it himself in the Tesoretto. Some therefore have suggested perhaps that Latini is placed in Canto XV for being violent against art and against his vernacular (Latini wrote in French instead of Florentine, which Dante championed as a literary language in De Vulgari Eloquentia); or perhaps also to demonstrate and underline that even the greatest of men may be guilty of private sins. Neither objection rules out the possibility that he was guilty of the perceived sin himself; and given the setting and context, it is difficult to see that there can be any doubt, particularly following the discovery in recent years of a love poem, "S'eo son distretto inamoratamente" which Latini seems to have sent to another man, Bondie Dietaiuti.[4][5]```
yes, nuance
maybe i should say "layers" instead, ha ha concentric rings joke
but no, seriously, dante's imagery is extremely fucking dense in terms of metaphorical meaning and importance
also happy birthday saffron
hope it's a good one
"hoo boy," i say as i lowkey await the explosion of discourse with mild excitement
isn't it also pointed out that ||half-elves age slower than humans even if not as slowly as full elves||
fuck you misha, i hate that that made me laugh
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
this is how it works here ennemy
you post something that seems innocuous and then it blows up because we're a pretty weird cultural mix with a bunch of different perspectives
i love it, frankly
<a:eyesshake:526187606610804737>
age of majority and age of consent are different concepts
no they're literally different concepts ifnar
oh okay
it's also still gross so who cares
alright lat, let's roll back the edginess
we've made the distinction between pedophiles and child molesters before, this isn't a new argument
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
i don't think that lends your argument any credibility
i have also met people like that but what you're saying is almost certainly incorrect
i regret lowkey asking for discourse because this topic is awkward and uncomfortable as fuck
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
okay, with each passing sentence i'm further convinced you don't actually know what the fuck you're talking about and it's starting to become irritating
move on from this topic
only warning
<@!200033159553875979> come back and actually talk about your book, i'm putting an end to what was already here because it sucks
that's the definition of style i guess
i have some of the ringworld books in storage, i got them for christmas one year and i still haven't read any of them
i need to do that, i have trouble describing scenery and that sounds like a component most people like about the series
stephan's solar system
i think about that sometimes woc
it's a neat concept in theory but then as soon as you start thinking about some of the awful, horrible shit some people do to others, it's kind of terrifying
also what about ayylmaos
can't wait to be that one alien species from three worlds collide where they eat their own children
you mean maymays
that thumbnail automatically makes me want to listen to dagothwave
also i just got to the strip with "guess what's in the closet? a skeleton!" and i never realized that lie bot doesn't even fucking open the closet, philippe just starts screaming like the dickens
linkybot lives in europe confirmed?
hopefully he holds his liquor better than i do
incoming coup
i like the implication that there's a rotation of secret features
we already have spat for that
how can you kill a god
my internet is fucking SHITE today
stop this shitty conversation
next poop/brap joke is a ban
performing for you
if you know the words
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i tried once and didn't make it very far
i'll try it again soon since i actually am trying to do new things again now
no you fucking simpleton
i've been mondo depressed since like before the start of the year and trying to do anything i'm not already familiar with is a fucking chore and a half
i'm trying to get out of it by injecting new content directly into my veins
i'm actually some way through chapter 2 so yeah
i'm going to at least complete that and maybe take a break
what can i say, depression is a bitch
as soon as i actually made a concerted effort to start getting through it i blasted through the last half of the first chapter in less than a day
yeah, imagine
what do you mean top of their ranks
<@!335686105456312321> thanks for the heads up, fixed
i mean, i still don't know basically anything about it tarty
my internet sucks enough here that i wasn't able to watch misha's stream of it
i know green rocket blast and AUUUUGH and grenades but other than that i don't have any idea what the plot is
and also JC A BOMB
i'll play it at some point now that i've got more free time
i'm determined to get through as much of higurashi as i can
how long is this thing again
like 20 chapters, which all have 10+ parts
probably more than the minimum it takes to complete it because he's revisited chapters
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
jesus fucking christ
nope, there's a quid pro quo at stake
yep, i finally am pushing through and getting into it proper
complete onikakushi last week and am determined to complete watanagashi tonight
the bubonic plague is caused by yersinia pestus, which is a fairly common bacteria in most parts of the world
there are cases of infection every year in the united states, it's easily treated by antibiotics
```Last month, two cases of bubonic plague were confirmed in Mongolia -- brothers who had both eaten marmot meat, according to China's state-run news agency Xinhua. In May 2019, another couple in Mongolia died from the plague after eating the raw kidney of a marmot, thought to be a folk remedy for good health.

Marmots a type of large ground squirrel that is eaten in some parts of China and the neighboring country Mongolia, and which have historically caused plague outbreaks in the region.
The marmot is believed to have caused the 1911 pneumonic plague epidemic, which killed about 63,000 people in northeast China. It was hunted for its fur, which soared in popularity among international traders. The diseased fur products were traded and transported around the country -- infecting thousands along the way.```
this is never going to stop unless the east starts educating people against this shit
i think we've had enough of metawank for one lifetime at this point, yes
look at that hardboiled maverick
can anyone possibly be as hardboiled as him? i do not think so
i don't get it what's the problem
<@!207991389613457408> this shion stuff was endearing
i feel a little tickle there, like "i'm glad i decided to continue this"
i don't know why i would stream higurashi
VNs are not good stream material
unless it's like short and very comedic

i still wonder sometimes about how and why someone decided to make this video
oh fuck that's right, i need to watch the movies
i guess i'll do that tonight
i like the fact that the biden side is happening like
right now
really underscores the absurdity of it
nice nost
i cut my hair about two months ago? and i'm going to continue letting it grow probably all winter
maybe even past that
it's time to become grug caveman forest dweller linky
i just got done taking a shower, when it dries out sufficiently i'll take a picture for reference
because every single time i get a fucking haircut, andrew is like "PICS"
and i'm like "why would i do that unless you saw how long my hair was"
you know the pain olympics?
i hope your silence doesn't mean you're looking up the pain olympics right now, i highly recommend against it
ah, it's shitty internet
that is far more acceptable
kids these days
they don't know
(thank god)
it's weird to think about how most internet people moving forward simply won't know about shit like pain olympics or any of the other shock content out there
is most of that stuff still up?? stuff like tub girl and lemon party??
goatse is more than simple shock humor, it's a fucking institution okay
yeah, but
that would require me to look at lemon party again
oh god
no, don't
harpy are you over the age of 1
lmao, over the age of 1
there's a wikipedia page??? holy shit
i gotta look this up
anyway if you're a legal adult you can safely be shown this without possibility of us being fucking sued, but just be warned
it is explicit
```Newer versions of the site had links to dolphinsex.org and urinalpoop.org, while older versions linked to biganal.com.```
wow, this takes me back
```As of January 2014, goatse.cx has been preparing to launch its own cryptocurrency, the "Goatse Coin".[citation needed] As of August 2014, the site shows a YouTube video promoting dogecoin.```
```On November 24, 2000, the Goatse "giver" and "receiver" images were posted to the official online Oprah Winfrey Message Boards in the Soul Stories board. Trystan T. Cotten and Kimberly Springer, authors of Stories of Oprah: the Oprahfication of American Culture, said that this "seemingly considerable male intrusion drove many of the women elsewhere, and the board was retired shortly afterwards".```
```The Los Angeles Times Wikitorial was introduced on June 17, 2005, to be a publicly accessible method of directly responding to the paper's editorials... L.A. Times editorial and opinion editor Michael Kinsley stated that "Wikitorials may be one of those things that within six months will be standard. It's the ultimate in reader participation".[21] The wiki was closed two days later on June 19, 2005, because, The Guardian reported, "explicit images known as Goatses appeared on [it]".[20]```
indeed
that's why i wrote 700+ pages about it
pre-winter haircut photo incoming

mark this post for later
i'm going to make a great santa claus someday
2FA tho
i try
it's hard, but it's a good thing to try and bring joy to people
we have entered the twilight zone
not like the show, but literally just the zone of the channel which takes place at midnight
in what
real life?
melee in cafe-lit is characterized by crafting a comprehensive, logical, and well-written opinion, and then shoving it right up your opponent's ass
hot take: twilight princess's edgy/gritty writing has aged badly, but i still love the bloom in a lot of places, especially where they were trying to indicate a more broad/grandiose scale to the world
you all suck
is it time already, father
i wonder what i did in my past lives that made it so i deserved to be treated this way
you know mike judge also voices boomhauer
take a shit üéµ
`I'M JOKING GEEZ`
they are genitals
i just misread "anime" as "asinine" and if that doesn't say anything about the artform then i don't know what does
boo to that
today we have a bunch of inventions from a weird, genius physicist
today is honestly kind of terrible
but i'm watching a kamen rider movie so hopefully it'll improve
how about you
what are you pickling, and what did you think of the update
WHAT
i can't hear you over all this earwax
wtc spoilers ||the call of the gold isn't a soul thing, the call is like an entity of its own from outside the body||
at least from what i gathered
essentialism has no place here
basically
<@!207991389613457408> KILLBAS SPIDERRRRRRRRR
i kind of hate killbas's like
appearance?
and just how insanely overdramatic his motions are
but i like when he tones it down and displays power of some sort
like him summoning that fullbottle was great
i'm kind of weirded out about this plot but it makes sense as a followup
like, i 'm never a fan when a show or story undoes the progress it made before, but i'm not surprised we're seeing this kind of development
it feels weird to have ||the eradication of evolt undone by an associate of the ayylmao coming and basically resurrecting him, and at the same time it awakens the memories of everyone else who was involved in the original timeline?||
like if you were gonna do that just... leave the original series in a different place that doesn't make it so you have to walk back
ah, that explains it
i didn't realize this movie wasn't exactly planned
BIRIDU
he just summons smashes from his own spirit sperm
that's pretty intense
we were talking a bit about how canonicty is much less strictly viewed in japan, weren't we
yeah that's fine then
YOU WERE ALIVE, EVOLT?
jesus christ this smug asshole
oh wait what
no hold on
evolt is fighting WITH the kamen riders? holy shit, did i mis ssomething
mfw evolt shows up and starts fighting the baddy too
also this is WAY smoother than trying to watch on cytube i'm afraid
i don't know what it is, i can watch youtube or other stuff like that just fine but livestreams shit the bed most of the time
i think i can work with it though
dude, cross z came out and killbas fucking volleyball spiked him into next week
that's rough buddy
>galaxy finish
<:pogStrider:728134286406057995>
that was pretty fun
it took me a second to remember this was only 60 minutes and not 90 or so

delightful
yeahhh
grease next tho
being a competent gold mage sounds pretty good, yeah
how much of it have you actually read
like two chapters
yeah, this just sounds like rhetorical jacking off
how do you know that
haven't you not even read like 90% of them
are you just constantly pulling shit out of your ass
do i need to shove that shit back inside your ass for you
did you FINISH THEM
or did you read one chapter and call it good
your opinion is invalid
get the fuck outta here
i too did not really enjoy modern cannibals, it felt kind of nervewracking and confusing
sorry magis, post-modernism doesn't do it for me
oh no, i hate everything about these romance subplots
chizu
i like how that leg morphs directly into his ass, that's quality
but also i think the point i'm trying to make is that your threshold for tolerability is incredibly low
no, i mean low, because you give up on shit almost immediately
hm
maybe, let me rephrase
you suck dogg
holy shit <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
holy shit this guy started speaking english and it scared me for a second
we should have a finnegan's wake contest
whoever gets the farthest without totally losing their mind wins
andrew, that's fucking vile, do not say it again
i don't necessarily think that wTC book 1 is bad, i feel like it's rough for people to get into
important distinction
chapters 1-3 or so could DEFINITELY use a little bit of retooling to not give the impression that it's a zombie video game story

wadapan your entire life is a paradox
it's like getting candlejacked, you j
fortnite dances will never not make me think of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUAT2u5X1Zo
you mean the part where it's fake pandora panel and he just stone cold shoots the motherfucker in the chest
i must have missed that?
maybe once all is said and done, the story could use a prologue that sets up a little bit of mystery and indicates there's a broader scale than just what we see in the first book
yeah, that was fucking weird
how can you tell a fursona is bad
it looks like this
insert picture of sergal here
it feels like this guy's burn scar prosthetic isn't consistently applied somehow
i dig the black transformation though
METALU BIRIDU
that cat is hell of pissed
pussies
the author looked back at his own work and thought "i can't fap to this"
holy shit, the three stooges are sacrificing themselves?? that's metal as fuck
pronounce it like brrrrrrr
the problem is that with each type of imagery that gets banned, the overton window will shift until people simply jack off to something else
the logical conclusion of this is that people get off on the very letters themselves
you are wiser for it
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
it is
"creating a tulpa" means "fooling yourself into believing someone in your head is real"
i'm not convinced that they all do
some of them might be able to reach that level of disassociation and hallucination
but i think most of them are like doing a really in-depth game of pretend, where they're trying their hardest to see and feel something that they can't actually
i'm not just saying this as a pre-emptive judgment, i used to hang out casually in an IRC chat specifically dedicated to making tulpae
they had extensive guides and dozens of people who really, earnestly tried their hardest to pull this shit off
yes veli there are people out there who really truly believe this stuff
it's like talking to someone who believes horoscopes actually predict your future, or homeopathy can cure your testicular cancer
that argument doesn't hold to me makin
if you don't expose someone to language they don't learn that either

lmao
for some reason
that close-up shot of the three dog tags waving in his hand was hilarious to me
like he's decked out in this ridiculous suit and there are just regular ass dog tags
rip three stooges tho
i want that guy's job who says the shit like READY GO though
PERFECT KINGDOM FINISH
DOGOON
lat that just sounds like... wishful thinking
i too think a lot about turning back this year or even the last decade and doing things over
that doesn't make it a delusion that just makes it a fantasy
i'm only participating in weeb shit when i feel like it
it's kind of hard to lately
i have too much shit going on
i DID just get caught up with kamen rider though, and i'll catch up on the stuff we're watching now over the weekend
yeah, but then openly recognizing that you are actively operating under a delusion??? that's fucking weird
aren't people usually unaware that they're laboring within a delusion
the very meaning of the word delusion is believing something that's false
```an idiosyncratic belief or impression that is firmly maintained despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality or rational argument```
and you can maintain this belief even while recognizing that it's a contradiction
okay sure when you contextualize it like that it makes more sense lat
for some reason this is just completely blowing my mind
it's a form of torture
sorry woc, i love all the aspects of living in the country you do except that one
i cannot stand living without air conditioner
heat is the devil
socializing is easy enough when you know what you're doing, it's just an energy drain for certain kinds of people
talking with others usually does not invigorate me, i'm always tired afterwards
talking to people i'm not very familiar with is doubly exhausting
talking with neighbors is fucking anathema to my existence
also yeah no qweq love hotels do not exist here
trust me i've looked
i'm not informed about this
describe the fortnite apple wars
at hote
YOU JUST POSTED CRINGE
YOU ARE GOING TO LOOSE SUBSCRIBERS
yeah, why would apple be fucked
isn't fortnite less popular than it used to be
isn't apple a trillion dollar company now
even if they're in the wrong, apple will have so many lawyers up epicgame's ass that they'll be shitting legal documents for years
steam is the biggest online game retailer by a country mile
they're benevolent right now which is fine
but it's highly likely they won't always be
in order to prevent anti-trust tactics they shold probably be reduced in size and power as soon as possible
what a fucking world we live in
it's just that the situation is complicated
i don't think yours is wrong it just cuts out an enormous number of details
which i guess is the point, but the situation is so fuck complex
yeah i'm trying to come up with a summary and it's still like multiple rows of text
i think kreuz's summary is fine for people who just don't give a shit
who has benefits these days
calidor got banned months ago
for a blatantly transphobic comment
i can't pretend to know exactly what they think, but i don't believe it would be that unreasonable to suspect that they genuinely hate big fandom spaces because they're harder to control
the amino has basically no interaction with any other section of the fandom though
they're kind of an enigma
hussie went from saying "my goal is not to fuck anything up" to saying "it'd be a good show of faith if you changed the server owner and also had a few of our people on your mod team" to finally saying "you need to replace most of your mods, if not all"
this would be fine, except that his standards for why that needed to happen were bullshit
i'm 100% certain that no one on the official team, hussie included, understands how big communities work, and i strongly suspect that none of them care either
unless hussie changes tack in how he interacts with us and the fandom at large, i firmly want nothing to do with him or anyone on the official team
homestuck is unique among all the properties i've ever enjoyed in that the owners are generally foul and have utter disdain for the people who consume their shit
no thanks i'm not a fan of legumes
yeah no, mother 1 is trash
earthbound has a more like
grandiose feel, and more coherent too
mother 3 actually has an emotional arc though
on a narrative and technical basis mother 3 is somewhat better but i think i prefer the tone and scope of earthbound
well, it's a very engaging story
that shit is emotional
don't worry about pinging me for below zero updates
i'm not playing the game again until full is released
i give it six years because it'll take forever to actually get to that point
i saw that earlier, was he actually significantly responsible for it
it seems that this was primarily a negotiation between netanyahu and prince mohammed, and the extent of trump's involvement is not really specified as far as i can tell
i am extremely doubtful that he played more than a marginal part in the proceedings, because if he had it probably would have been a fucking shit show
that doesn't matter, what matters is the actual content of his contribution
it doesn't matter if trump was in the three way call if all he said was shit like "bigly peace" and "many people have said that your countries are the greatest most beautifulest countries"
we're never going to find out what exactly was said so i can't bring myself to care very much
more peace in the world is always good
i'm not downplaying his autonomy, i'm doubting the extent to which he actually involved himself or instilled any positive action
i fully believe that trump carries out his own willful actions most of the time, but usually when he involves himself it's a complete disaster
that's why i doubt that he was actually heavily featured in these negotiations
if he had been the primary participant then i genuinely don't think this deal would have been brokered
he's not smart or politically competent enough
it's very simple tensei, let me depict it graphically for you

just because he's overseen one arguably good thing doesn't give me confidence that he was actually responsible for it in any significant way
this is because most of what he touches turns into a nightmare
it's kind of like if you have an employee that's constantly fucking things up and turning stuff into a bigger problem than it was before
every so often that employee might do something good
but there's going to be a huge part of your brain that says "did he actually manage to _not_ fuck something up this time?"
"was he actually competent for once or was this a fluke? was he even _involved?_"
that made me do a doubletake so hard that i think i saw into an alternate universe for a second
there wasn't enough time to warn them about everything
doing what exactly
what do you mean it cuts both ways
i don't really know what that has to do with this tensei
trump says he's going to do positive thing and doesn't = bad
trump says he's going to do negative thing and doesn't = good thing
no, that's not what that means
it depends on why exactly it doesn't happen
this is really lazy bait and easily responded to is why
like, it's not hard to inject nuance into this conversation
if he doesn't do negative thing because he learned better and changed his mind, that IS good
but if he didn't do it because he simply forgot and doesn't care, that's neutral at best
figuring out which of those is happening is the hard part, but based on his track record of what he says and ACTUALLY does, i'm far more inclined to believe it's the latter
you know, kreuz is right
i don't know why i'm engaging with this
it just tires me out and makes me more sad than i already am
it's too real for me
and i don't think that the ramifications of trump's presidency are as jokey as you tend to make them out to be
this guy fucking sucks and i genuinely fear the effect he's having on politics and national unity here
like, it could turn out that his actions aren't actually all that impactful
if that turns out to be the case then that's great, i'll feel silly about having been upset about it
but in the meantime i'm pretty worried
or what's his nuts basically trashing the postal service
i relate uncomfortably well to roast beef's internal and external monologues at times
it's not quite so severe but the dude says shit and i'm like "oh no i've felt that before"
hell of disquieting
<:roastbeef:743611974918602854>

<@!125433170047795200> glorious day! i found my "woc is a loser" hat
your ass is grass son
i can't even think about hugh neutron without smiling, but hearing people's descriptions of it is even better
tarty saying "the sheer audacity of it" got me going pretty good
nesquik has become a victim of its own success
if i already know it's coming i can't laugh at it anymore
we need to start doing shit like with rickrolls where we change the thumbnail or have a bait and switch
also the avatar one woc? yeah i did
it didn't get me quite as much, was still quality tho
well, just keep going and see if your opinion changes
wales has writing "moods" that come and go, his style is influenced heavily by his mood and his mood tends to change as the year goes on
that's a fucking quality clip
i wish my internet wasn't so shite, it would be easier to join in stuff like this
as it is my internet just takes a giant dump anywhere near livestreams
glad you guys are enjoying deus ex though
i need to play it sometime
indeed
but that's okay, i make up for it in getting bit by bugs when i go outside and doing massive amounts of yard work
in a way, it's actually quite nostalgic, and i find myself getting a surprising amount of stuff done
i think i've commented before that my grandparents have not taken very good care of this place, but with each passing day i fix or clean something else and make it nicer
the interior is basically almost completely revitalized, there's just a few tiles on the floor that need to be replaced (and a few big parts of the floor we're going to cover with a rug to make it easier)
the outside will take some work though
üë®‚Äçüåæ yep
das me, farmer brown
i sleep all night and i work all day
gotta drive a combine, hick hick hick
my dad was never fond of farmers driving tractors and shit on the roads out here
whenever he got stuck behind one he'd start fuming and muttering "farmer fuck fuck" under his breath
hey pops
_this thing still work_
it's because we're (usually) just doing it at every possible opportunity
woc does that because he's an absolute menace
but for the rest of us it's usually a tactical insertion
also what the fuck do you mean tera
oh you mean _pizza_
chicago deep dish ain't great i'm not gonna lie
i had it while in chicago and while it's not quite lasagna, it was still swimming with marinara sauce and i was not a fan
now, there IS a type of pizza in chicago that is fucking crazy and good
i don't remember where i went but there was this pub that had pizza where, instead of dough for the crust, they just underlined the pizza with more cheese and then baked it so long that the outside cheese caramelized into its own kind of crust
that pizza was fucking _transcendant_
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
Girls like a boy who eats cheese.
i need to go to botspam one of these days and just populate the bot with an insane number of meme phrases so it's more likely to hit one of those
oh that's topical reti, i found the hat again
unfortunately it's now midnight so i will not be taking pictures as i am in pajamas
fuck is taurs
wait
nevermind
i don't want to know
do not send me any information about this
<@!125433170047795200>
<@!227181775221161984> obviously i'm very, very late, but you're fucking insane
the animation in akira is and was highly lauded because it was incredibly detailed at a time where animation in anime was extremely cheap and unrealistic
with the kind of stereotypes you hear mocked even to this day, like side mouths and talking that consists entirely of opening and closing the mouth like a beak
and even beyond just being bad it was more stylistic
akira moved away from that and did 1) more realistic proportions 2) higher number of frames for smoother anatomical motions 3) mouth movements that actually match what the speakers are saying
if you're talking about the fact that the movie looks kind of grainy and old, that's because it _is_ you disrespectful little trollop
akira was released in 1988 so REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
see listen to misha he knows what's up
Wath
I've been out all day since I woke up what's going on
Sorry I've been gone all day, I went to the Tallgrass National Prairie Reserve
It was very nice, I took some pictures and am debating sharing them
Yeah, you right, I should be setting a better example
Away I go
Have some pictures I took on a hike out at the Tallgrass National Prairie Reserve

Yeah, we started at the worst time but it got cooler as we went o
I also took a completely shitty picture of some bison that were like less than a football field away from us, very scary creatures

Sun was like right in my eyes so I couldn't quite focus on them
This part of Kansas is actually quiet hilly, it's just that there are few trees around so the increased horizon makes it seem really flat
It's quite cool, if you have just the right angle and hill you can see for miles
Like, so far off that the land seems to fade into haze
why in the fuck was i pinged about obama RP
what the hell
i'm not looking through backlog, explain
yeah RP is a huge no no
it attracts weirdoes
no rp

or else die

it's gonna be hot

"yes i'll take a 'brain aneurysm' please"
that sounds like one hell of a drink
i wonder what the brain aneurysm would consist of
that's incredible
old monuments and structures are really wonderful to think about

how much money have you made so far
that just sounds like god shaped hole
<@!120187484863856640> i thought you weren't listing people who completed the shill list anymore, yet i see a list of people who have completed the shill list at the bottom
why did you get rid of the leaderboard if you still have this up
ah
well, fuck
i guess i need to do the ones i haven't yet
because it takes place in a hyper-technological future where people have access to hologram technology that lets them do or look like whatever they want
what's the actual term for it again, neoreactionary?
oh yeah it's just "reactionary"
it's a homestuck reference
well, fuck
let me see which works i haven't read yet
cordyceps, man from earth, mother of learning, john dies at the end
that's not so bad
althoguh i'm not looking forward to mother of learning, i tried reading it once and was horrifically bored
i have a prime account so i think i can watch this immediately, but does man from earth typically cost money to watch
i mean that's cool
but i was more suggesting, perhaps we can watch it as a group
let me see if i can't try to get this set up even with my fucking shittastic internet
someone give me a link to the torrent and i'll get it up on google drive
THE HEAVY IS DEAD???!!!
i mean, i don't blame anyone for deciding NOT to read god-shaped hole
it's much easier to ignore the shortcomings of an author whose work you're not familiar with
kind of like how i refuse to listen to chris brown's music but i'm already deep into homestuck so i might as well keep going
people get defensive about stuff they like a lot lat, i used to do the same thing
also yes
no git, that's not really correct
everyone does it to some extent but lat makes it an extremely consistent reaction to even innocuous things
rationalize this: <:kek:230307022598438912>
i thought it would be okay to shill it as furry as a joke, but then the conversation became very serious and i got egg on my face forever
aren't you like 17
then yeah i'm not surprised
there's a lot of media out there
stop being surprised when people don't know about things
one of these days you're going to hear someone say "what's star trek" and your fucking brain will explode
i mean, in fairness, galaxy quest is not "a personal pet movie"
it's the most successful and popular star trek parody
i'm still not surprised people dont know about it
if it was something like harry potter i would be more surprised
if we're going to watch french shit we need to watch fantastic planet
i have _foreseen_ it
<a:aSithHusky:668208374827057174>
the wind rises is literally just a visual biography of the japanese engineer's life
it's a very straightforward, non-mystical movie by ghibli's standards
my favorite pick from among theirs was The Nth Degree
i love that episode
barclay is Our Guy
i'm more weirded out by the fact that the lorax movie came out 8 years ago
i tried smoking weed from a bong one time, took a microhit and i couldn't stop coughing for like fifteen minutes
fuck that crap
lat why are you such a wiener
nik the point of the question is that you don't bother asking or getting to know the person, you just assume that because they are x they automatically know y and are good at it
golf
lat conversations like this are why i have to keep reminding myself that you're actually a dumb teenager who just pretends to know shit
tiger woods is like the one person of color of any repute in golf
yeah, that's why you're a dumb teenager
lacrosse is like weirder golf in terms of popular reception
4 barrel roll! 1 2 3 4 nice.
bwee
some crrrrrrrust
probably
also when are we watching super troopers
that movie is rational as fuck
i'm setting up the man from tomorrow movie to eventually stream as a group
hopefully it's good and not SHIt
no love for win the race? pathetic
THAT DOES IT
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE RACED YOU
the virgin eggman vs the chad robotnik
yeah don't abuse mines, they're great
as they say, life is stranger than fiction
oh hey inexplicably i think my life of brian upload is working now
also i'm getting the man from earth ready now
it shall be ready At Some Point
mko,l
no, i'm trying to spell "i'm tired"
i'm not sure exactly how effective those high frequency devices are in terms of actually dispersing people or animals
i keep seeing stuff like that advertised for getting rid of bugs but i'm skeptical to the point of not bothering to try them out
well, it is finally time to read the shills i have been avoiding thus far
starting with cordyceps
cordyceps is definitely on this list zent, have you fucking checked it lately
<:foooooooooool:292673270199746561>
deez nuts
washington nationals
she's making a game where everyone playing experiences unjust suffering and murder
i'm still lowkey excited that the nats won the world series last year, for the first time too
any year where the yankees, cardinals, and red sox _don't_ win is great
the royals won back in 85 so it's not quite so exciting, but i still know what you were going through since we won for the second time in 2015
we came super close in 2014 but the san francisco giants fucked us, so we came back with a vengeance
<:ree:475542526791516170>
cordyceps done
i might need a bit of time to digest it, i don't know
you're garbage
anyway i want to say that cordyceps is well constructed but it didn't really spark anything in me
i really fucking hated that arc kid, overly paranoid characters are annoying as fuck
i'm not sure which part of the story i found most interesting, the disease or the initial cause of it, but i'd say that the length of the story is great for the amount of detail we got
overall this is somewhere in the middle of my rankings for the shill list
i'll get started on uhhh
ah, christ, i guess i'll do mother of learning next
i've got man from earth uploaded to google drive, i want to do a group stream if possible
blah blah wieners
i wonder if today would be a good time to stream the moive
in some hours
everyone has been mysteriously gone all morning so maybe not
over here!
```Words: 823,563```
4 u
i'm gonna grab some lunch before i tackle this
i think streams are finally being rolled back a little bit so saturdays, yeah
it frees up additional days for less formal streams which is great
was getting tired of not being able to make people watch wieners 2: the frugegno dilemma
but we _can_
and we really should, because i doubt most people here have even seen black dynamite
we need more cultural exposure
which brings me back to somethingi said last night, which is that life of brian is actually ready to go
so maybe we can do that or man from earth, perhaps alongside TPn today
i'm down for whatever really, i just need some kind of stimulation
just got back from the store, are we doing life of brian today afte rall
i'll take that as a no, you all disappoint me
ah, that's right linkybot, we have a role for this
<@&693935623966425219> react with ‚òëÔ∏è if you're up for life of brian tonight, <:RedTick:319944054211346432> if you'd rather be a lame-o wiener
took long enough

that does it

how many people watch northernlion exactly
oh wow a surprising number of people wanting to watch life of brian
<@&693935623966425219> enough people said yes, we'll start in half an hour. if you want to start a little bit later, say 5 PM EST, then say so now so we can delay for you
hopefully the movie doesn't inexplicably fuck up like last time too
i literally just said
alright sure, we'll do an hour from now instead then
no reason not to give people a little more time
i mean, that's a plausible reason, but it feels a bit prolonged and overt to be subliminal messaging
yik fucking died after it was restricted off of college campuses wasn't it
wait, okay, i was thinking of yikyak
what is yiik
you can stop there
<@&693935623966425219> alright, five minutes until we start life of brian, get in early and suggest some meme vids if you want, but we startin' as soon as we get like 10 people in here <https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight>.
let me read backlog
everyone shut the fuck up
no, just stop talking
i don't want to have to za warudo unless it gets uncivil
now SHUT IT
that's pretty unambiguous
<@!690246912334364744> you at least walked back your statement and apologized so i'm not gonna full you, but 3 day all-ban, and next time think before you say some nasty awful shit
<@!227181775221161984> you see how that works
wait
i didn't see that shit <:BroFrustration:231802701975912458>
<@!690246912334364744> nevermind if you're going to be openly hostile and transphobic then you can just not be here
the bot is gone, sorry about that guys
fucking spam
<@!227181775221161984> also i'm late because my attention is being split six ways right now but tensei and mines were right, they were actively trying to handle the problem in their way
i implicitly trust their judgment, let them handle it next time and don't be a minimod
you REE
i did not enjoy life of brian as much as i thought i would
i might also have just been in a bad mood from dealing with dumb drama tonight
i don't know, i didn't think it was _bad_
i just didn't enjoy it
is fall guys going to be the next flavor of the month game
because from what i've seen i'm kind of down for that

i'm going fishing, watch the house for me

fly fishing is great fun
it's because dero kept taking shit for pictures

hm
snooping as usual i see
i finally bought a touch pen for my laptop but it doesn't have quite as much fidelity as i would like
just something i'll have to get used to i guess
it doesn't track all of my movements precisely
it's pretty close but the penstrokes are choppy sometimes
meh
i don't anticipate using it very much, it's more a just in case thing
you can't see it but i'm waving my hand lazily
i can't be assed
all of that and a faulty poopy pipe is causing so much trouble
doodledip
gonna start mother of learning now i guess
that's the last big shill and then i'll be almost done catching up on the shills
thank goodness
the fuck are you talking about
i haven't finished higurashi
i'm taking a break from it since i completed the first chapter
<:howAnime:436258055278166028>
not yet
my suffering is not complete
YOU LIED
i still have it yeah
it might be tough since my internet is shite now, but i'm down to try whenever we can wrangle everyone
very resourceful
nah woc is pretty much the same irl as he is here
it's just that there's like, more space between what he says in real life, because in reality people associate with each other a lot more than just the things they say
also it's much easier to understand when he's joking when you can read his facial expressions and hear the tone of his voice
otherwise my 'tism is too strong and i can't tell sometimes
<@!213413608732884994> you tryin to tell me you never make fat dong jokes with your friends
it's gonna take a LOT to convince me of that

BOO TO THAT
WHY FIND OUT
<:ResidentSleeper:240720478925225984>
achewood is the name of the residential area that the comic takes place in
why is any residential area called anything
```According to the comic's official website, "achewood" was an ingredient used by slaves during the United States of America antebellum in the production of "achewater", a now outlawed Southern drink with psychedelic properties, similar to the use of wormwood in the production of absinthe. This liquor would supposedly induce melancholia in the drinker, hence the name.```
enough
move on from this nonsense or death follows
why a man even got to do that
you're lucky i'm reading achewood at the moment
i'd take her out, sure
behind the shed
are we seriously splitting hairs over this
i'm suddenly very irritated about this
me too, linky bot
me too
do it
NO WAY MAN
IT MUST BE

i don't know why i'm being so fucking snippy today, i'm sorry
i hate waking up early
your life is forfeit
do not FORGET my mom
taffy convention
i always thought that achewood continuity was less precise than it actually is
like, details of characters and the setting might shift around as the story goes by, as is convenient
but no it's actually very consistent
this is definitely one of the best comics i've ever read, online or print
beach sounds pretty good right now not gonna lie
man why you gotta do a thing like that
<:howlow2:676840417328889962>
it's how lowing you fucking pleb
imagine not how lowing
alright enough of this
i remember that linkybot pull, it was from a discussion about confederate flags and whether historically important ones should be kept in a museum or destroyed like the rest of them
like i think that one in particular was about a specific flag that was actually flown during the war by a confederate officer
should have joined us when we did them
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
i'm not going to lie, i often forget what the confederate flag looks like until i see it again
it's not THAT remarkable, and whenever i see it it's usually on the back of someone's coal rolling truck
which means i hate that person's guts and want to forget my encounter as soon as physically possible
citypop is so nice
it's practically cozy
EXPLAIN YOURSELF
mother of learning is actually shaping up to be way more interesting than i initially thought it would
the writing feels stilted in general but the premise is interesting enough
every time someone even thinks about TWOW, grrm's life is extended by another month for him to not work on it
yeah, you were quite vociferous about it actually
i enjoy it enough that i want to get back into it
nah i understand, it's an epic in the truest sense of the word
it takes an epic amount of time to get through
<:GOTTEM:433050116946001921>
i got all the way up through book 7 and i found the internal consistency/continuity to be extremely satisfying
there's a concrete sense of progression not just for the characters, but the world as a whole
that's kind of My Shit
not for everyone though, it's quite daunting
another thing to add to my growing pile of books to read
finish the shills, finish higurashi, do iconoclasts or finish achewood
then pick wheel of time back up
it's always nice to get back into reading
wow, it's been a while
they do it for kicks nut
just get some sort of weird fun out of it
yeah i don't either

yeah this is good, usually she's very nervous and frightened
ativan is a relaxant

wasn't the height of ron jeremy's career in like the 60s and 70s
what is he doing still alive
holy shit what
have i missed all this, when did ron jeremy get outed as a sex pervert
i had no fucking idea
vr that statement is actually pretty informative, i agree with misha that you're being kind of a brainlet
asking him those questions was the first constructive thing you did since he explained
<@!131892666714685442> we already more or less settled this conversation actually, and it only took us four years to do it
art holistically is subjective, and any semblance of objective discussion relies on the establishment of certain "axioms of quality"
that is, within individual schools of art, there will be different fundamentally important ideas that are used to determine what is good and what is bad
which is why stuff like surrealism, abstract art, cubist, realist, etc can all exist and have a defined aesthetic while also not necessarily being better than one another
it's much easier to identify an axiom of quality within a given genre or type of art than to approach it as a more complex whole
GOOD OLD P.U.
oh boy are we actually getting into art debate again
i thought it would die off but this is exciting üçø
<@!195585050509574144> spat has been very slow and has basically grinded to a halt for the last few weeks or so
i don't have the energy or motivation to write about anything right now
i encourage users to bring me news or information they find interesting about the server or each other
otherwise the latest update will probably be the last for a while
i don't know anything about motorcycles but i think they might actually be designed that way on purpose
like with cars there are some unintuitive safety features for motorcycles, which are already extremely dangerous
there's basically no rider protection, so if you crash the best you can do is to tuck yourself into a ball and hope you can roll well
the bike exploding might be a way of reducing the chances of hitting a large piece of debris, such as the bike itself, and instead hitting something relatively small like one individual part
that's just a guess, i could be totally off the mark
i sometimes think about getting a motorcycle
more fuel efficient but basically a deathwish unless you're extremely attentive
you mean like a license for motorcycles specifically??
because yeah i should, but i already know how to ride one so it wouldn't be that difficult
yeah you need to qualify to ride bikes
it's another registration added to your license
i haven't had the chance to ride a bike in a while and i definitely won't be buying one anytime soon, so i just haven't bothered
that super brief moment where people knew it was going on but didn't quite realize the severity and cultural importance of the event
it's hard to say, and yet...
that last one kind of makes me think of how we react to things?
or, not the last one
the one that says "WATCH BUSH START A WAR"
"WATCH TRUMP START A WAR"
i'm reasonably certain at least one person here has literally said that, in response to a number of things
the killing of the iranian leader earlier this year comes to mind
man, i just got a really weird sense of time passing all of a sudden
holy shit i think that was the time when it happened too
holy fucking shit the context <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

i don't know why but this is _extremely_ funny to me
god damn, this entire conversation has been like a mobius double reacharound mind fuck
what do you mean mj
i'll bite and go for the obvious: dwarf fortress
sunburns are something else
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
hit me
yeah, i'm having trouble wrapping my head around that
while the chat is quiet, just a heads up
actually you know what
i think this deserves a pin
we're cracking down on brapposting and other overtly scatological humor because honestly it's been getting fucking outrageous over the last few months, i've already told off the mods who make those jokes and told them not to do it anymore so there shouldn't be any problems with hypocrisy. no more hugh neutron, no more nesquik, no more DAAAAAAYUM, just keep it to DMs you fucking sickos

that's not going in the pin album by the way
just fucking control yourselves
i feel kind of bad about outlawing the nesquik video because it STILL makes me laugh, but it's just a gateway into a horrible dimension
yes, and i was wrong for doing that carl
i recognize my flaws and work to improve them
CAN YOU SAY THE SAME, IMPERIAL?
how many free spaces do we have left
it's not a matter of imgur, the pin list has a total volume of 50 before it requires cleaning
i like to get to it every once in a while but i'm being lazy
so we have room then
it can wait
i would agree that time to see my ass is fine, but i also don't want us to start resorting to ass humor as a blanket replacement for brapposting
oh god, i was barely present for technomilk
i'm going to regret asking this, but what are you talking about
never speak of this again.
woc, how is it that so much stuff coming from you is like sex and shit based
it feels like at every turn you push the boundaries of acceptability for humor here
don't get me wrong, i find it funny too
i'm just amazed how consistent this is
then maybe i need to electrify the fence
<:ree:475542526791516170>
well, i keep saying he was better at managing this place than i am
i maintain fully that i'm better at the people aspect of this job but he ran a tighter ship and didn't put up with as much shit as i do
it's accurate to say there's nothing here _systematically_ keeping new people from being regulars, but culturally we're pretty difficult to get into because we're more casually abrasive and combative in conversations
which i think has real value
every general chat and its mother is "actually public" in the sense that it has no filters and is more accepting of what gets posted there
sometimes i want a specific flavor of discussion
i've thought about making lit an opt-in deal but makin shot that down when he was still in charge
after considering it for a while i think it's kind of a dumb idea
nah, i think we need to get back to our roots a bit
read-shills is a fine name

they are
no one can speak in them
oh that too

don't care right now
i'm aggravated as fuck
i'll deal with it another time
i don't know if i should talk about it here
it has to do with the brapposting hypocrisy thing
it's just an enormous fucking headache
i hate being argued into a logical corner and not being able to do anything about it because what i see as the right path forward is not logical
i'm going to eat more sour sweetarts and hopefully burn a hole in my stomach
<@!153392726832840706> watch it
i don't want to have to ban every message with "fart" in it but that's where this is going realistically
light mode stuff literally hurts my eyes
not an exaggeration, it's physically painful to stare at any webpage with white backgrounds
split is great
ironically i don't think watching mst3k is as good in a group setting
at least not the way we usually do it
you know, it IS space mutiny
and that particular episode of mst3k is very good
so yeah we'd probably do the peanut gallery
can't believe they're even thinking about making people attend college in person
thank fuck that i got my degree and got out
there is no god damn way i could tolerate that
OOHOOGH
>smart people
that was your first mistake
<@!125433170047795200> you talk mighty quick and loose for someone who's within banning distance
it's a pain in my ass but i kind of enjoy that we have sort of a tier list of degenerate behaviors
i banned brapposting and talking about shit, so now it's vore
when i inevitably ban that, it'll end up being feet
when i ban THAT it'll be like... i don't even know

MAX, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
gyorg lopez
what is deroing, precisely
what the fuck
that's not what any of that was
carmen and max are george lopez's _children_ in the show
wait are you talking about his talk show
also that was a game grumps reference
pokemon emerald, at some point they catch a lotad and want to name it "george lopez" but shorten it to "georglopez" and then jon gets angry because they set the name but he wants to change it again to "gyorglopez"
yes that is the joke
jon is a fuck huge zelda fan
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
how things change
yeah, years ago
i don't care that his opinions were wrong/misguided, it's more that he refused to walk them back and understand when he was being told he was wrong
like, after all was said and done, jon doubled down on stuff
is this a deus ex thing
i've lost control of my life

"ZELDA BREATH OF THE WILDE 3" i don't know why this amused me as much as it did
^ pro-lifers are psychotically opposed to abortion in literally every circumstance
they don't even accept abortion in the case of severely underaged girls who aren't even physically ready and will probably die as a result of carrying to term
thaaaaaat's american politics
no, pro-choice is actually a completely accurate title for what they're pushing
okay nevermind you're just being a skub jackass
"straight up here's some aborted babies, bon appetit"
biohazard disposal procedure probably
you know, i was going to outline basic disposal methods for biohazardous materials but abortions are so controversial i'm sure that would cause fuckhuge fits
let me look this information up and make my ISP think i'm a freak
it seems that abortions are disposed of by cremation, at least if under 24 weeks of development
alright misha shut the fuck up
i've had enough of abortion jokes today
i don't even know how to wrap my mind around this
we're talking about taking a woman's aborted embryo/fetus and turning it into hamburger to eat, are you sure you want to say "this isn't a joke" about all this
okaaaay
i can at least appreciate the urge to discuss it
i would be willing to entertain that discussion
it's just that the way it was phrased made it seem like you wanted to eat abortions
which was some real jiz and the mammograms shit
i feel like discussing the ethics of consuming abortions or disembodied limbs is like on the very edge of the envelope of acceptability for what happens here
we've still got a few months left in the year
i'm holding out hope
that we'll get... another release trailer...
i'm kind of retroactively glad that friendsim was made because at least these characters saw some use
who could have seen this coming, it's not like zuckerberg is extremely out of touch with human beings in general and also a fucking enormous scumbag even putting aside the way he decides to accrue wealth
what does "all-in-one" mean here, and are you implying the index isn't that
if yes, then what is the index good for specifically
how in the hell does that work
what do you even use a quest _for_
yeah in that case why bother
i can already go out and purchase a cheap ass headset where i shove my phone in front of my face and get a headache
yeah, fair
startup costs and such
sorry, i'm out for today
i just want to read
i almost have to wonder why anyone would bother, but i guess if it's convincing enough that'd still be neat
they have walking simulators and such
but i guess what i'm saying is
when do you get to shoot a dude
terrible, terrible
but fair
yeah, an index is the first new piece of tech i'm excited to raise money for
i also want a 3D printer but i honestly wouldn't use it that much
why kitten
and how honestly
oh
yeah i don't want to touch the concept of crowdfunding anything with a ten foot pole
there's other apps you can play through the index right
like i saw one person who had an emulator set up where it looked like they were sitting in a bedroom and playing n64 on a CRT
it's dumb as hell but i saw that and immediately went "i want that"
stfu
it's fruitless, i can no longer obtain joy from linkybot
IT WAS ALL A JAPE
the absolute madman
<:FeelsWeirdMan:585874417360437270>
linkybot is developing quite a mythology
remember when people thought kim jong un was dead so they were going to appoint his sister as supreme leader of north korea, and then a shit ton of people started unironically simping on her because she would be a female dictator

nail pogo is used in the green section, crossing acid pits
so what
it's still present
the other examples gnawms cited are way more cogent
part of the plot _is_ the lore, it's the same kind of gradual storytelling that dark souls does
you don't NEED to find any bits of lore or care about them, but they exist for people who are interested
and the nice thing about hollow knight's lore is that it's completely dripping with style and tone
every character feels really nicely fleshed out despite not talking to them overly much most of the time
also fuck you woc there are tons of people who care about dark souls lore
just because your retarded ass can't handle it doesn't mean everyone else is a brainlet too
why do you think appending "and then they respected him" to the end of each of those tidbits makes them less interesting
those are actually fairly succinct descriptions of what's going on, and you know what, i didn't even fucking REALIZE that's what was going on with the first one
i never made that connection in my mind even though i saw the other grubs, so clearly you were able to wrestle more meaning out of it than i did
why are you being such a wet blanket if you're clearly able to scry this kind of detail and meaning from more subtle storytelling
yes, we have a word for "everyone was trying to help and then went insane"
it's called "a theme"
that's how storytelling goes
you have a recurrent plot element that ties everything together
How could you do this to me?
What's the context on that
Totally

HOLY SHIT, FGF STREAM TOMORROW

we just call them bluegills to avoid confusion

it was the only fish we caught today i think
still fun
what's in the middle
"this space intentionally left blank"
unfortunately, yes
oh my god
this is very embarrassing, but ever since joe biden announced kamala harris as his running mate, for some reason i thought she and amy klobuchar were the same person
at some point someone pointed out that kamala harris is a person of color and i even SAW HER FACE at one point and i didn't even realize my misunderstanding
bolas are you fucking with me right now or something
i was talking about fucking "people of color" you utter reprobate
oh boy, can't wait for this one to show up on linkybot
anyway, i don't know shit about klobuchar but kamala harris was a _prosecutor,_ not a cop
and even if she was a cop, that doesn't automatically make her a demon
pull your head out of your ass
i feel very weird that i have to point out this distinction
i don't know if you knew this but prosecutors still have an important function to carry out in justice systems
yes i know that the american justice system is full of holes but
i don't know how to tell you that there are actual criminals that need to be prosecuted by the state for committing offenses
yeah basically
i have basically no strong feelings about kamala harris besides "if they don't beat trump this november i'm going to be pissed"
i'm sure she has some shady shit going on because it seems at this point you almost literally can't be a politician and have some nefarious nonsense go on at SOME point in your life
but i really, really don't give a shit just yet
focus on getting the CLEARLY GREATER OF TWO EVILS out before trying to kneecap us, thank you

back to mother of learning
i'm actually enjoying it a decent amount gnawms
it has obvious problems like a weird inability to create different voices for different characters, and of course it's very long for what the concept is
but i don't know how it ends so maybe it justifies that at some point
either way, you are being a wiener

i don't think that the hussie vriska thing is a fair angle of attack at all because it's well-established as not being serious
real hussie doesn't actually experience any sort of romantic or sexual attraction to vriska the fictional character
unless i'm deeply mistaken, in which case...
hey how about we don't dig up personal details
and by "how about we don't" i mean "do not do this or else"
if you want to argue it's creepy that's perfectly fine
i don't particularly care about the vriska thing
man, what am i doing with my life
sometimes i take a step back and really try to understand what it is i'm doing here and why
no, it's just like
i mean, im not in it for the comic at this point
i haven't been in it for the comic for like two years at this point gnawms
and even if i had been, i certainly wouldn't have been anymore after february
i took the job for the people here, largely
i still do care very much about the people on the mod team, in this channel, and the rest of the server
why do you think i wrote spat, it's a fucking madman's project
also here's the thing gnawms
i say largely defeatist things about homestuck now but it's not so clearcut as that
there's an ideal scenario here
hussie and co need to realize that openly antagonizing their fanbase is self-defeating, and additionally they need to do a reboot of homestuck 2 where they eliminate their horrible artistic choices and do shit that actually manages to excite their audience and engage them
like i said, ideal case, never gonna happen
oh yeah, true lat
the real ideal case is that homestuck is put in the ground forever and they decide to do something new and actually interesting
homestuck 2 has been handled like absolute garbage and it's demoralizing watching a property i've loved for 8 years circle the drain because the people in charge of it are hopelessly out of touch with their audience
it's kind of similar to how star wars the original trilogy finished and was viewed as this really fucking iconic thing, then george lucas got it in his head to do the prequels and fucked them up horribly for a variety of hilarious reasons
and to be fair, the prequels have attained their own kind of iconic status, but it's for clearly different reasons than the original trilogy
i've slowly come to appreciate the prequels as works of accidental comedy
that is not how they were written
no
no they are not
```why does everyone who claims to not care about hs2 find a way to bring it up at every fucking opportunity``` there's always one person who hyperbolizes and says that we bring up hs2 incessantly, despite this being the first time we've talked about it in earnest in like... days? weeks?? i can't remember
it's more confusing because i don't think any of us were talking about this from a capitalist angle
the initial argument wasn't really about economic structures at all
the initial argument was about how a fanbase and the creators of the content it consumes should interact with each other, which is a relationship that can be examined outside of any relationship to economics
no, that's incorrect lat
they can interact just fine
there are a plethora of examples where fanbases interact directly or even loosely with the creators of the content they consume and it's constructive/positive
you are pulling shit out of your ass _again_
ironically, the one that comes to mind the most is the halo subreddit
you often have developer responses to questions or comments submitted by the community and often enough it leads to greater communication/understanding of an issue
comics are an example misha has explained to me before, where typically content creators are thankful/receptive to the comments that their readers make because... y'know... they fucking read the shit the comic writers are making, and thus have a vested interest in what they're making
it also doesn't really spark _that much_ conversation <:howAnime:436258055278166028>
not to say that controversy isn't effective
what i mean is more that hs2 is failing to grab that much attention
we talk about updates for like a day or two and then inevitably go back to just talking about other things
there's no general engagement or desire to theorycraft because what we're being shown isn't that interesting, controversial or not
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
so what does homestuck 2 want, exactly
to be reviled and make people upset?
because it's doing a good job, both diegetically and nondiegetically
well, no, but i guess it's fine to want different fandom responses based on what your goals are
i just fundamentally don't understand what the creators of hs2 want, and the way they've interacted with us (and the fandom at large) so far has been largely insulting
multi that makes no fucking sense
sit down and stop making dumb leaps of logic
WHY
no it doesn't lat
it inspires _some_ people to make their own food, but 90% of the time it doesn't
hell, upwards of 90%
arguably the best parts of homestuck are the ones where hussie was able to creatively engage with the fandom and turn it all into a greater whole
<a:blair:424571787372658708>
jesus lat, how have you developed such horrid takes
i was actually talking with my gf about this extensively the other day
guilty pleasure time: we both watch miraculous ladybug and enjoy the fuck out of it
thomas astruc is the creator of miraculous ladybug and he occupies a very specific kind of relationship with the fandom as a whole
namely, thomas speaks with people and listens to their theories, but he's in a position where he could ambiguously take the advice/insights of people who watch his content and incorporate it somehow, or he could leave it alone and do his own thing
it's not clear what he'll do, it looks like he prefers to stick with a more formulaic approach but there's a surprising amount of depth to his show if you take a step back and examine it
the big question is whether or not thomas himself is aware of that depth, and whether he's able to take in fan opinions without being tainted by them, so to speak
it is perfectly possible and good to be able to listen to an opinion without entertaining it
it's hard to say whether the toblerones were a failure, because the ramifications and seriousness of the associated wishes is completely undefined at this point
hussie has declared june egbert to be canon; okay, so what
is it actually in writing yet
if not, then that means nothing
"nothing in homestuck is serious" this is farcical
there is plenty of stuff in homestuck that is tonally and narratively serious
pretending that it's not does no one any favors
there are ALSO moments of levity
having an interplay between those two things is important because it gave variety to the work and made it more engaging
yeah, vdnw is a great meme, but saying the words "vriska did nothing wrong" and wholly, unironically believing it says really weird and uncomfortable things about who you are as a person
i distinctly remember him saying those words, yes
it might have been referenced in pesterquest actually
`How do make scenes flow?`
what
hm
i didn't think about it before, i guess "it's not close enough to the games" is a common enough complaint
i thought most people were upset with the mario movie for being fucking dumb
as opposed to unfaithful to the source material
because like, at the time the mario movie was made, the source material was like extremely new
like, zelda cartoon levels of new
people don't remember how mutable video game ~lore~ was back when these franchises were still really young
i mean cohen wasn't a great guy either, his involvement in the development of hiveswap and the snaps was kind of a shitshow and there are probably a bunch of problematic things about him i'm not aware of
but he's also been out of the scene for--right, sorry
i don't think about cohen that often, i forgot they changed their pronouns
anyway, i was saying that cohen wasn't a great person, but they've also been out of the picture for years at this point
unless their actions are immediately impactful i don't really see why we're bringing them up
PRONOUN ABOLITIONISM
i'm trying to wrap my mind around this and failing
no you are wrong
lmao
i love how blatant it is, just "anyone can do this" in the bottom right
thank god for people and content that are self-aware
you can see their mistrust build as the video proceeds
oh my god
well, that's definitely a thing
this is really bizarre to look at
do these people not know how to behave professionally
i would rather cut my own fingers off than work for WP at this point
also hype, i had the motivation to write the first spat entry i've bothered with in a while
take it back thne
i don't want this
i'm gonna end up giving the server to misha or woc one of these days
or more likely mines
mines is fucking great
but i don't feel like making mines deal with this horrible bullshit
nights firmly wants to avoid online socialization at this point
it sucks but she's got focus, i gotta admire her for it
i respect tensei way too much to ever even bring up the idea of giving him the server
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
yeah, they had so many ideas that they never gave us any in the six months we shared a group chat
we made a lot of progress
anyway, i'm not sure what kind of insane lunatic would actually be able to _enjoy_ this job
i'm already an insane lunatic for doing it without getting paid
you'll just have to wait and see cy, i'm not releasing it with just one entry
don't bother, i'm a wiener
do you mean no complaints against you or no complaints of your own
if the latter, would that change if you still owned the server now, knowing what we know
i know it was a joke, my plan was to subvert your joke by treating it completely seriously and it worked
truly you are a fool
china... number... one?
how much do you expect you'll get for it
four cents?
what are you talking about
makin has plenty of friends
he probably went down in the sewers to eat the toblerone with the rest of the rats
"hey what's up everybody i'm going to be eating this rancid ass chocolate bar, check this shit out"
the gang's all here.
... D'OHH
i keep trying to think of something to respond to this with but it's so abjectly horrifying that my brain just seizes up every time
the second person is commenting on the nature of fandom, and to be fair, that's a decent appraisal
autism is a very complicated patter of behaviors that arises from a combination of factors both genetic, cultural, and psychological
just because you fear the ramifications of it having genetic components doesn't make that any less the case
i don't like this conversation
i'm not here to condone people teaching each other how to find and use medication in ways they aren't supposed to
it makes me nervous is all
i have to suffer through enough conversations with crazy relatives who all give each other "tips" on how to gather medical supplies without drawing attention and/or modify it somehow to get the thing they really want
unironically yes, krato
anyway my point is that this conversation makes me nervous and i urge you all to be cautious about how exactly you discuss the topic
if i feel like things are going south i'm terminating the discussion
<@!168980988477702145> i will take care of the iceberg right now, thank you for the reminder
finally got tera's breakdown of carlarc's meme iceberg up on the google doc, next to tackle it HTML-ways
it always feels freaky looking directly at the sun when it's being covered just barely
there are many times here where we'll get a thin cloud covering so that the intensity of the sun is highly reduced so you can look directly at it without being blinded, but it's still just this circle of light in the sky
<@!120187484863856640> are you still asleep
fuck, he is
i guess i can't upload this spat entry yet
i can just take this time to work on tera's iceberg article
it is truly impressive, upon review
a solid work of investigation and explanation
<@!168980988477702145> you did good with this
i should have it up on the website soon enough

i don't know that hussie is a _bad person_ per se, i don't know anything about what he does in his day to day life or how he treats people in real life
i DO know firsthand that he's horribly out of touch with his audience, and i worry that he's manipulative when there's something he wants
i don't know, hopefully i never have to interact with him again
i'd rather just leave it at that
i don't hate homestuck at all, and i feel weird when people here claim that they do or that we collectively hate it
i hate what homestuck has turned into certainly
it's like watching a really precocious child turn into a heroin addict
i like how sky complains that we constantly rag on homestuck but this conversation would never have come up if not for the question about hussie
i don't know andrew
is everyone else available then
i'm free so count me in, but misha and dero better be present too
i met RJ Lake briefly at magfest this year
he was in the game corner showing off a project he was working on, and it was really cool
magfest is a convention that happens in DC every year in january
"music anime and gaming"
anyway RJ is fucking chill
i liked talking with him, even though it was only a few minutes
what do you mean howhigh shirt when
there is absolutely zero chance of us ever selling merch of any kind
it's such a moronic idea
you know i technically like
can't stop you guys from making individual pieces of merchandise that's HSD related
and share it between each other
as long as it's not infringing on existing copyright, especially by WP or homestuck or whatever, you could do whatever the fuck you want
an underground HSD merch ring <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that's some punk shit to be quite honest
learn from your mistakes sky, or this will keep happening
sweet
let me make sure i do have it downloaded
affirmative
uh, these??

so i should also get the data one installed
then i'm good
<@!207991389613457408> you're into cigars right
i need some advice
next tuesday, dero and i are going trout fishing all day and we're going to enjoy ourselves with a little smoke while we're at it
do you have any recommendations
you really know your shit
i'm glad i asked, i haven't touched a cigar in something like six years and i didn't know anything about them back then either
always got those pathetic little cigarillos, cuz it was just me and a few other people smoking socially after movie night
by "pathetic" i don't mean that cigarillos are pathetic by nature, i mean they were those shitty dollar cigars you get at gas stations
with some cherry flavor on the wooden tip
definitely left a lot to be desired
i once had some kind of quorum cigar that was way stronger than i expected after all of the little ones
i had one puff and it nearly knocked me off of my feet
if i ever manage to get down to brazil and we have a chance to hang out, it's going to be fucking decadent as hell
i'm sorry for your loss
i have relatives in north carolina, every time i visited i was fucking miserable
i kind of hate it
driving everywhere is just a common component of american life
public transit is restricted to the really big cities and even they don't have it sometimes
kansas city just got a trolley like... a couple years ago
before then they had NO public transit of any kind
it was fucking awful
<@!207991389613457408> alright, after looking into it i'm gonna pick up some of those aroma de cuba cigars for the occasion
i'm not used to huge cigars and i'm ignorant of the sizes, though i have a guide open
tell me o wise one, what size do you recommend
also i don't really smoke sky, cigars are an extremely rare event for me and i haven't had one in something like six years
the sizes they're offering are belicoso, churchill, corona, double corona, el jefe gordo, immensa gordo, monarch toro, robusto, and rothschild robusto
ah, i see how this works
the inches are the length of the cigar, and the two digit numbers are the gauge
this makes sense
where do you even pick shit like this up
are there specialty stores or can you pick up nice cigars at like liquor and smoke shops
there seem to be a few places in the town nearby i can buy cigars, i'll check it out tomorrow and see if they have anything good
there are some REAL good cigar shops in the area but they're all in kansas city and i don't even know if we're heading in that direction when we go trout fishing
i have to admit, my favorite parts of california were not the cities, though san francisco and sacramento both had some neat stuff in them
the best parts of california are all in nature
the redwoods are something i will never forget
have i shown you guys the redwood seedling i've got growing actually
nah, i'm good
i'll watch space dandy some other time, i'm trying to figure out cigars
get OUT
sanfran had some nice parts to it, be fair
the tenderloin district is one of the most frightening places i've ever walked through, but aside from that it was mostly nice
i got to walk onto a real sailing ship at fisherman's wharf and i was fucking ecstatic about that
the tenderloin district is where all the homeless people live
i've never before walked through a street where it was basically a village made of tents
i got to witness a homeless novella play out while we were walking through where two homeless people were fighting each other very... slowly... and then a third one was watching and laughing like "HAHAHA THEY'S FIGHTIN' AGIIIN"
you mean me
yeah, i visit kansas city semi-regularly
i'm not sure what the homeless population is like here, because i almost never see any
i never saw a homeless person in a city before i went to chicago
nah, they mulch them into fertilizer
get it right
yes, that's the real question sky
the housing market has been getting worse here as well, of course, but i just don't know these things
it's better than sleeping in the woods or in the sewer, or in an alleyway where they'll get fucking killed
art is good but if it's coming at the cost of release speed then it should be toned down a bit
hs2's writing would be much easier to stomach if the plot was progressing
what in the actual fuck
presumably the art is the bottleneck that's reducing the speed at which they release
writing does not take that long
... explain yourself
yeah, this feels like an unnecessary extension of the "having friends on the internet" theme, which is way more direct and important an idea
you can _still make_ online friends even if you go to a public school
maybe they never made any friends in school
i did, but even so the vast majority of my friends by far were online people
there's a particular kind of socialization that arises from talking to people extensively on the internet, like a whole culture of etiquette and interaction, that is different from talking to people irl
that is the point of homestuck
homeschooling can lead people to socialize on the internet but it's not a required factor, is my point
well of course you're going to fucking relate it to being homeschooled if you were homeschooled yourself
it's fine if you got that interpretation out of it
i'm just saying from a wider perspective, what you're saying feels like a very narrow band of meaning
i don't think the average person looks at homestuck and thinks "this is a metaphor for homeschooling"
the average person DOES look at it and think "this is a metaphor about socializing online"
or not a metaphor, but that's just the single most important theme
make a wish tori
i don't know what that was carl but it made me laugh
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
fuck, with the mistake you posted before it just makes me laugh even harder
yeah, that's just blatant insanity
i mean, every ideology can be variously meme or sincere
this leads to a common problem: a meme ideology often attracts people who genuinely believe it, which ruins the fun for everyone
no it doesn't multi, carl's graph is actually less funny than her just posting a single "howhigh" on a giant white canvas
the graph is kind of incomprehensible
FINALLY

anyway, posadism is funny but it has as much depth to it as a puddle of urine
oh yeah, what happened to the chaz
is it still a thing or did it get shut down already
yeah, saw that one coming
CHAZ was an interesting concept but in practice it was mondo stupid and self-defeating
would have been much more interesting if they tried to establish something in a nearby park
the biggest problem is that it was in the middle of a city, yes
i don't mean in a CITY PARKi meant like a national or state park
the city park still has easy access to municipal utilities
is it possible to have a kind of loose commune where you do that
i'm talking like a community of people who all live somewhat spaced out from each other, where you all live in individual houses and only associate with each other infrequently or as needed
OH WAIT that's called living in the fucking country
i'm doing it literally right now, and it is great
look at that blue
HSD commune wouldn't work we're too interested in the arts
an HSD irl community would only work in the way i described it
the ideal image in my mind is everyone lives in their own little square of property, and the "server" is like central community area that people can freely enter and leave whenever they're free or want to
tarty i very much want to become more of a handyman, can i ask you for tips on homebuilding and improvement projects
private property is great, the problem is a lack of regulation as _always_
it depends on the commune probably
no one actually reads das kapital except people who take political or economic theory, and even then i'm sure most of those people just cliffs notes it
ah, i see what's going on
do not diddle kiiiiids, do not diddle kiiiiiids
pretty sure they were talking about christians and mormons, not christians and communists
i like that the text for the guy on the bottom is somewhat larger than it is for the mom
ALWAYS ON YOUR DAMN PHONE
it somehow just dawned on me that this is all mastodon-centric theory we're making fun of, and suddenly it makes sense why i'm so irritated
my internet went out
fuck, we're talking about magic? no, i won't abide by this
talk about something else, immediately
yeah, i don't like it and i'm a dictator like in real life communist states, so i'm forcing everyone to do what i want on pain of death
talk about something else
me bunga
also misha if you could be so kind, dero and i are visiting some smoke shops up in a town nearby that could have a good variety, i'm still bent on the la aroma de cuba but give me a small list of other varieties that would be good so i can look for those if the first isn't available
anyway, magic the gathering has been talked to DEATH in here
and i viscerally cannot stand mtg posting anymore because people rant about it for fucking _hours_ before they finally get pushed somewhere else
i'm expediting matters
no, that is literally incorrect multi
warhammerposting only started once misha got here
mtg posting has been around since i fucking joined this place back in 2016
who would play which parts
dazed and confused
i know, i'm sorry, i just need a favor
damn it
jim and colin are by far my favorite guests on rlm
they have really great commentary and some pretty good insights on stuff
that line in particular was from their review over joe versus the volcano
one of my favorites, because they introduce jim to this particular mixed drink that he loves so much he keeps asking for refills
and every single time he mentions the drink, they overlay the audio with good lovin' by the rascals
honestly this is an extremely good reView with a very strange combination of speakers, i highly recommend just watching it as a normal viewing experience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw0z9kK7ssQ
don't know what that is
elaborate
that actually sounds like something i thought of for movies when i was younger, and i'm interested to see how this concept does it
we can always watch it sometime
so liek
wednesday might work but we'll talk about it tomorrow
i'm waiting for makin to show up, i want to push this spat entry out and he needs to write commentary
though at this point i should just wait until tomorrow
it's late and people are asleep
bah
just getting off of the desktop
i have all my HTML files on it, not my laptop
i'm going back to reading mother of learning
my internet died for 40 minutes and this is still on my fucking screen
get RID OF IT
yeah, better than nothing though
i'll put it up when i wake up tomorrow
is this unironic
why am i bothering, of course it is
i need to get up and put the spat entry out but i just want to keep reading mother of learning
i'll do it in a couple hours
mother of learning is a story in the shills list
i've been avoiding it for years because it's long and when i tried it the first time i was really boerd by the first chapter
after giving it a few chapters i'm fairly well hooked now
yeah, rlm is by far at its best when it's relying on unconventional techniques for stuff
standard joke and delivery from them is not very good, but mike screaming and cutting prematurely from a scene always works with them
also i'm putting up the new spat entry, give me a few
was it interesting
then no
it's not just 51 minutes makin
that's what they managed to edit down
their conversations typically last a lot longer than that
oh yeah, i forgot about that
i'm down though
alright, spat entry is up https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/bookii2020.html#19A
it's a short one, don't @ me
oh, no, sorry
forgot to wipe that second one
i added a little bit to it this morning
because i saw tera use it first
also deus is a wiener
hey fart, what's up
got it bad, got it bad, got it bad, i'm hot for--<:kek:230307022598438912>

Brief interruption to show you my giant sequoia seedling

what the fuck is this conversation
<@!207991389613457408> i was not able to find any of the cigars you told me about, they'rep robably only available in the city
i got a variety of low and high cost ones instead since i'm new to this anyway
tensei it's for a special occasion, i'm going trout fishing with dero on tuesday and that's part of the experience apparently
no, but that would have been great
i used to smoke cigars when i was still part of a movie night group back in undergraduate school, a couple years before i joined this place
they were never anything good though, those little awful swisher sweets
GRAPE FLAVORED SMOKES
it's been up for hours
candy cigs were always a favorite of mine growing up, no wonder i'm fat
also yes spat update, go find it
Oh so it's not just me
My laptop can't connect at all
thank god, i'm back
drew are you fucking serious
drew, how is you fucking?
i is gud
anyway yes i'm serious, did you miss the whole conversation last night where i asked misha for some recommendations
it's also not like i'm picking this up for the first time, i used to have cigars socially when i was in undergraduate school
this will basically be the exact same thing, except even less frequently
get off my nutsack

<@!125433170047795200> You've got ten seconds to beat it before I add you to the list of NSF casualties.
i kind of want to now, yeah
but i have other stuff i want to finish up first
it'll take a bit but i'm having a good time actually going through and trying new stuff again
i think i may be out of my depression haze again, it's easy to like... enjoy stuff again, y'know
<:FeelsGoodMan:547970841300828170>
you mean the chaos emeralds?
well, they can
it's more just a matter of who cares
a fan-made hiveswap would almost certainly be done faster, and i have a suspicion it'd be better too depending on how carefully the treat the story
not so, although there HAS been a pretty substantial talent drain in the last few years
<:THONKeng:386532084790984727>
why
i don't mean to be insensitive but <#152981670507577344>
move it
last warning, bans incoming
because it doesn't belong here and we've had four thousand discussions in the last couple weeks about how conversational quality here is degrading
removing brapposting has thankfully helped but personal discussion also gets too intense sometimes
now get OUT
i also agree that excessive discussions about obscure math shit should go elsewhere
i don't think i was around for that discussion
i haven't worked on a game grumps transcription in a while
i think jon being a fucking pillock has kind of ruined my motivation for it
i don't really know carl
i stopped paying attention, but i think he's just as arrogant in his misguidedness as before
maybe not about the race thing in particular but in general
poleeteek
<@!132287296798982144> knock that shit OFF
no, i'm serious
that's irritating as fuck
maxmikester, yes
over the last few months this channel has been 5% homestuck discourse, 10% getting annoyed at people for doing things they shouldn't be such as brapposting, 25% personal discussion that goes too far occasionally, and 60% discussing media in variously constructive manners
you haven't even fucking been here for most of the time and as soon as you come back you start ejaculating homestuck jargon at every possible opportunity
misguided did come from LLF, yes
maxmikester was "unbecoming"
you rotate, okay
very similar to nuts and honey
that is an OLD meme, god damn
i think YOU did
let me go check
well that's interesting
i can't find the misguided comic anywhere in the pin archive, even though it was explicitly one of the pins
maybe i just never put it in there? let me check my desktop folder
thank god i kept two copies of this shit
yeah, it's just completely missing from the archive
a damn good thing we had this conversation then
yeah, that's not a good thing qweq
the impermanence of human memory is an awful, awful thing
silence, wench
oh, while we're at it, i found another old meme image

it's surprisingly hard trying to find this image's original usage
anyone remember mspa-lit tan tho
there were some legit great ones tensei drew too

this one is particularly disturbing
fuck it i'm wasting too much time trying to find this
there's so much history here
it's honestly kind of overwhelming
the original usage of the misguided comic
i'm pretty sure that tensei made it but i can't find it even with narrowed search results
i'm curious because i'm 99% sure it was pinned but i don't have it in the archive
same with the tensei butterfly image up-scale
i feel like i'm losing my mind
also it seems that it WASN'T pinned
i'm going to include it in the archive anyway because my berenstein sense is killing me
people are allowed to keep the same profile image as long as they want
just pick one it's not like it matters
nice job trippo
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

well, hopefully it's not your problem anymore
it is rather an oppressive atmosphere

what they did was purchase a lot of insolvency/debt from corporations (i think) in order to keep them afloat
and like, y'know, that kind of makes sense, except that it's going to come back to bite us in the ass later
i don't necessarily think that what they did is "better than nothing" because the long term ramifications of this are going to be pretty substantial

i can barely take furries seriously, even thoguh i've known them since i was in middle school
is that SUPPOSED to be a shark, i thought it was a horse
pretty sure the only poll/census i've EVER seen conducted of the furry community suggested that it was split pretty evenly as to whether people considered furries to be inherently fetishistic or not
i mean, it's okay that it's a fetish, but it's not okay to entertain that fetish in a public space, that's why it's so contentious
because the people who do entertain it as a fetish shouldn't do it in public contexts or around people who do NOT entertain it as a fetish
sex is not a function

the original episode with moriarty was fucking excellent, and then the sequel to it was so laughably awful
"moriarty escapes from the holodeck and they trick him into going back by making him think he's flying through space forever"
i was so fucking mad about that
because AI becoming self-aware and having to learn how to interface with other beings is one of my favorite kinds of stories
and the ending of the first episode was so hopeful and interesting?
like "yes... i am the product of an evil character brought to life, but i am a new consciousness now, i must interact reasonably with people and hope that i have the chance to be brought to life in earnest later"
the sequel happens: "hahaha bitch suck my coooooock i'mtaking over this fucking ship"
god, i hate it so much
why wouldn't i just have the holodeck wirehead me at that point
what?? i must hve missed this

it's honestly quite a decent short story, go read it if you haven't
you'll get done with it in less than 20 minutes
i wasn't talking to just you strictly but sure
i said "if you haven't"
gesturing more broadly
i'm rereading it now and i'm impressed how short it is honestly
i felt like each section was at least a page instead of just a couple paragraphs

cave to more liberal political thinkers
don't start lumping more left-leaning ideology with accelerationists
accelerationists are a pretty specific, extreme thing
i'm _still_ not totally aware of what the clintons did that makes them so utterly vile even in comparison to someone who is openly a fascistic, racist, child molesting moron
can someone please explain in detail
alright, i can concede this then

the only thing that's remotely comparable to a "national ID" is your passport
that's a vlid form of identification in most cases
but state IDs are typically your driver's license and the requirements for getting either a driver's license or a passport are fucking weird and highly restrictive
you need several proofs of residency depending on what kind of ID you're trying to get

windwaker is definitely one of the more unconventional 3D zeldas

speaking of, how's mining the depths of oot's source code going cheeze
why the uck are you asking me about moneyplane
also that's fucking infuriating cheeze
why would they withhold all of the other stuff
like, is there any intention of releasing it at any point
the fact that they have THE ENTIRE COMMIT HISTORY is amazing
i'm just extremely curious to see what turns up i guess
this all looks scummy as usual
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

what in the actual fuck
i'm watching that now misha
i'm fucking amazed how bad the production looks in this
<@!207991389613457408> Money Plane.
<@!207991389613457408> "It's certainly interesting from a movie-making perspective, it's just baffling, and terrible... and-and how bad something could be--" `Money Plane.` "--in-and not in a charming way." `Got a bad feeling about this, things are going south.` "In kind of a disgusting way. I felt like I wanted to throw up after watching it, like in a way where I felt sorry for everyone involved in it, all the actors, I felt like sick--" `Money Plane.` "--like embarrassed--" `Bunch of bitches.` "--you know what I mean? As myself, as a viewer, like sick. After-after like maybe an hour of it, I felt sick that something could exist made by human beings that is so bad. I felt literally nauseous."
"So would you recommend it?" "Yeah."
this is the best episode they've done in a while, except for the skit parts, their script writing really sucks
their best skits are when they're self-aware and don't bother trying too hard
yeah it's fucking great
go watch it if you haven't, it's hilarious
Money Plane.

FUR MEIN ARSCHLOCH TOILETTENPAPIER BRAUCHE
hm
could have just gone the more typical english grammatical progression, "Ich brauche Toilettenpapier fur mein Arschloch"
i don't know why i get so confused with that
there are cases in german where the verb goes on the end, but i think it's only a specific kind
i am not very good with language
or maybe both are acceptable? god, i wish i remembered
genitive, yeah
also same neth, i can't fucking stand the gendered nouns
but it got easier when i kind of realized the cheat, which is that the pronoun will almost always rely on the ending of the noun
yeah, thank god we don't have gendered pronouns and instead we have... everything else that's horribly fucked up about english
i seem to remember someone whose native language was romantic like that, who was expressing great frustration at the gendered nature of it
their brains just couldn't fucking handle it
no, i'm the one who did that
oh, so it's not concrete like english?
or, you know what
english isn't even concrete, so sure
my dumb autistic brain doesn't know how to handle that i guess
that fucks with me so badly for some reason
my gf was learning mandarin at some point and you are correct, just her bare descriptions of the language made me want to an hero

they might as well _be_ aliens in a sense, because their living environment is so fundamentally different from ours
not even to speak of the deep, deep sea, like the abyssal floor
i mean, deep sea fish are definitely pretty funky looking
but even weirder are the environments that spring up around hydrothermal vents
entire communities of extremely bizarre fish and worms and molluscs springing up, just to die when the vent subsides

it's a good game, wouldn't mind streaming again honestly

why would i stretch myself even further by talking often in other places too
what are you talking about, i interact with people here on a daily basis and i talk as much as i can when i'm not doing anything else

ace combat has like weird difficulty spikes out of nowhere
i finished ace combat 4 very easily but ace combat 6 always threw me for some kind of loop in the first missions
i want to try it again at some point
no seriously at the beginning of ace combat 6 they have the megabase or whatever attacking and the requirements for some reason were hard enoguh i couldn't beat the level no matter what i did
it may be i was dumb and not paying attention
it's really weird to me that ace combat has rigorous continuity
isn't it also connected to a different namco game
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> that's fucking incredible
oh, you're trying wtc? holy shit
it's a really big work, i didn't think you'd go for it
if you're already on chapter 5 though you're making excellent time
it improves, don't worry
the game thing is cliche but it's done better than just about any other example of the genre i can find
and that makin can find, and he knows fucking every story under the sun
what
yeah this is ignorant nonsense
wtc has plenty of twists and turns to it, and more than one giant twist
or at least development
i return to reading mother of learning
you misunderstand, i wasn't calling you ignorant about isekais in general, obviously you have a high degree of exposure to isekais
but saying wtc is devoid of any good twist is baffling
like, wtc is a very long and intricate story with lots of moving parts, and the entire frame of the narrative shifts no less than two times in the story _already_
your appraisal is completely ridiculous
how do you have a twist in the _setting_
what the fuck is that about
that isn't a full sentence, actually, since you're going to try and insult my reading comprehension
it's broken up sentences like you always post you LOWLIFE
those are two separate messages
separate clauses
no, this isn't convoluted, you're just taking it for granted that your meaning was completely obvious
anyway, i fully admit my lack of knowledge of isekais, but that doesn't really invalidate my statement
it's the best isekai i know of that uses rpg elements
just because you know better doesn't invalidate what i'm saying
they have helicopters and airplanes for goodness sake
well, i don't know about that
there are certain aspects of the setting that are more interesting than others
it's like a matter of layers, where it's pretty generic on the surface but then all of the details kind of reveal their own style
i'm late cuz i was taking care of something but you guys are missing the point, as usual
the magic by itself isn't that cool but it's not supposed to be, the important shit is how the magic is applied and finding ways to exploit your powers

nnnnnnnnno i don't know if i agree with that
i was actually thinking of some of the stuff from worm last night, just brief glimpses from the story at various points
i think worm's strongpoints are its descriptive capabilities
wildbow has a way of describing really strange and unusual things and making very vivid verbal illustrations of them
like, there are a wide number of passages from it that really left a huge mental mark on me in terms of how i visualized the story
tm the entire story is just things happening one after another
that's arguably its weakest part is the fact that the pacing never ever lets up
am i hallucinating or something
there are many places in the story that undergo detailed description
i'm just
okay sure, yes
i'm mostly thinking of momentous stuff, not the individual things
like, examples: ||scion descending onto the world for the first time and appearing to the cruise passengers; edelon gaining full control of his powers back and chasing scion through the alternate earths; scion destroying behemoth utterly; nilbog's frightening territory as skitter tries to come negotiate with him||
i don't know, i feel like worm has PLENTY of descriptive power in moments where it's really really needed
the characters are treated as well, i remember specific details about various characters even all this time later
yes, ||all of skin magic was excluded, to the point that after they left the EZ, joon commented that he couldn't even feel his skin magically anymore||
I WILL KILL THINGS WITH THIS LIME
it's great even now
i mean, in aggregate at least more than individually
the last two seasons were definitely kind of rough, steve carell was a lynchpin
but the series finale hit like a ton of bricks
it was pretty good
i think that a story's ending does a lot to justify or invalidate what the rest of the story does
even if a story is fucking great 90% of the time, if the last 10% fucking sucks then it kind of taints the whole work
pizza rolls, pizza rolls, anybody wanna pizza roll? email me on my webzone and i'll send you a pizza roll in the mail

but also it's so fucking ridiculous still
jesus christ
if what you have told me today is true, you will have gained my trust
finally done
i was primed for a really bad ending for some reason, that was actually more than decent
i quite love the stickbug
yeah, it's basically the latest incarnation
it's a much different flavor of rickrolling though, very subtle and underplayed
those are the wrong words maybe
rickrolls are just very visceral with that drumbeat
like as soon as you get hit with it you're like "holy shit, not this again"
stickbug is like "oh my god my video just sto--oh it's outlining stickbug again"
but you're not even mad about it, you just watch them rearrange and then the little ditty starts playing
on the whole it's almost pleasant
you remember when people would purchase entire domain spaces and make them redirect to rickrolls or shock memes just for the fuck of it
when did that start falling out of vogue, i miss it terribly
and then this legend catapulting it into further greatness https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wytn-_MSBo
holy shit i totally forgot about that gnawms
god
like, on the whole, do you guys feel as if the internet has retained its level of weirdness and it's just _different_ now, or has the internet basically been tamed at this point
lmao, woc, that reminds me _explicitly_ of this thing i was reading the other day about the actual wild west
let me find the passage
```When a group of Tutt's supporters at the Lyon House mocked Hickok and announced that they had heard Tutt was planning to wear the watch "in the middle of the town square" the next day, Hickok reportedly replied, "He shouldn't come across that square unless dead men can walk."[4] Having apparently made up his mind, Hickok returned to his room to clean, oil and reload his pistols in anticipation of a confrontation with Tutt the next morning... as stated by a modern historian, "Nothing better described the times than the fact that dangling a watch held as security for a poker debt was widely regarded as a justifiable provocation for resorting to firearms."```
yeah, i've commented on that before actually
it feels like all memes are basically the same shit
where it's a short text passage with a commonly recognized image underneath it that at least vaguely fits the context
and to be fair, that's precisely what advice animals and all of that stuff was
but there was also more out there besides advice animals at the same time
now it's just all curated stuff on reddit or what people throw up on twitter/instagram and occasionally tumblr
4chan is like increasingly insular and irrelevant unless i'm mistaken
i remember when shit like this was enough to make people doubletake and you'd all gather around to watch it for a few minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3iC3SgsZO0

NOT ONE OF YA'S GONNA SURVIVE THIS
the sequel is pretty good, it just didn't improve on the original in any regard
it's basically just more of the same, which is fine because the incredibles is a fantastic movie, but with less thematic weight to it i guess
maybe if you're stoopid
as opposed to the five minutes he got in the original movie where he messed around with his babysitter and had even less importance in general
i'm not discounting that the parts with jackjack are dumb, i'm just saying there's a whole lotta movie still there which is really good
YEAH...
sounds like a movie reviewer tagline
"Incredibles 2: Incredibly Rushed"
well, also i think people are kind of fatigued from streams tera
we're already cutting bac
it'd be good to wait for that moment where people spontaneously want in
oh you're a mystic, nevermind
it's a red herring i thought this was incredibly obvious
i've never seen it
should we sometime
what's the actual worst
of course
wasn't cars 3 just the airplanes direct to home movie
oh wow i totally forgot about this
I
AM
SPEED
finally bothering to read the tf2 comics
yeah, in chronological order
i almost made the mistake of starting from the top of the webpage but thankfully the dates are clearly labeled
they're pleasantly stylistic
yeah i'll just peruse all of them
i'm enjoying them well enough
quality loading

sounds like the schizophrenia has taken a solid hold of this woman
yeah i've seen it before
i always felt weird that there was suddenly this bigger mythos or whatever though, so i'm familiarizing myself with all of it tonight
so i'm confused about the continuity here
i'm aware now that the comics are all canon
which is cool
but it seems--appropriately--that the mercs are evenly split down the middle as to whether they're on the red or blu team
so how do the animated videos play into it, like expiration date has all the mercs on the red team
is it looser canon or
i just finished the third one and am rewatching expiration date
also not going to lie, the comics have made me laugh zero times so far, although i did smile a few times with the main issues
the writing is good but for some reason it doesn't hit my funny bone quite right
expiration date on the other hand is very funny
i can't stop chuckling at this nonsense
yes i'm going in chronological order of release
i finished main issue 3 a bit ago and am finishing up expiration date now, just gonna do all the comics tonight
they don't exactly take long
okay this is the first time it got me

you're both dead to me
interestingly i never went through such a phase
even when i was a young teenager i recognized that the name "amazing atheist" was possibly one of the douchiest things you could name yourself
my boring what
i have news for you sky, the average age of homestuck fans probably never changed too much
it's just that the chances of being a homestuck fan decreases as you get older
hell, i'm 26 and the fact that i'm bothering to still read the comic when it puts updates out probably means there is something deeply wrong with me
my reptilian friend is not here to help me anymore
anyway, as i keep saying, i'm less here for the comic and more for the people at this point
homestuck brings people here but it's like adhesive that gets less effective with each passing year
you gotta find something else to latch onto or else you lose interest
2016 was like the Wild Years
2017 was the golden age, largely
actually
it's interesting how this has panned out, it reminds me of hesiod's description of the progression of humanity
2017 was kind of the golden age, with by far the greatest activity and generation of culture
2018 was a solid silver age where things were still largely active but not quite as productive, even though it was still quite nice
2019 was a deeply contentious year, with activity at its lowest point since 2016, effectively a bronze age
which puts us in the age of deities
a time of great strife and calamity, with the rise of new heroes and the children of gods
yeah it's because we're all nerds and idiots
based on this horrible metaphor, next year will be the iron age
where we will have to scrape and labor for our sustenance
good point
i guess we'll just die
lugnut dese balls, huh huh huh
i am sorely tempted
<@!168980988477702145> post the two together as a screencap and you got a deal
the mandate of linky cannot be ignored
well with that kind of message how can i resist

excuse me
this has been happening way more often than usual lately carc
i directly and explicitly blame lat and sky
they've been upsetting the feng shui here ever since they started talking again
HOLY
SHIT
LOOK
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
did i mess up the syntax
where the hell is the role
oh there it is, discord is just being fucking dumb again tonight
also scroll up literally two seconds and see where sky was literally spamming the political nonsense she's been pushing for the last week
granted it was a joke but i swear every time i see "shrike" on my screen it adds another six hours to my sleep defecit
also yes
have you guys not been paying attention
as multi said this is not the first time that sky has just spammed random keywords affiliated with whatever she feels like for the evening, which is extremely agitating and wouldn't be tolerated from anyone else either
also homer is correct
your keywords would be "i'm a furry look at me i hate homestuck now also i'm a bab"
not even wrong, it feels like i've been yelling at people a lot more lately
vegan
that's it
HOW CAN YOU TELL SOMEONE'S A VEGAN DON'T WORRY THEY'LL SHOVE THEIR FIST STRAIGHT UP YOUR ASS AND FORCIBLY REMOVE THE CHICKEN YOU HAD FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT
that was actually sufficiently relevant
it would be one thing if i did it absent of any kind of related context but we were literally just talking about cy being a vegan
do you see how that works
how is it so hard to explain to people what "proper shitposting" is
proceed
suddenly i have no idea what you're referring to
DM me i guess
oh, you mean like in other places besides here?? yeah sure i don't give a shit
as long as they're not going to try and come after me or my family
oh, "only" hundreds of pages
what fake politics would you like to argue about today
alright i finished mother of learning and read all of the tf2 comics today
i think that's a decent amount of reading
i've already read most of the shills list
at one point i had completely finished it
makin added four new shills since then so i'm just doing my due diligence
it is a mystery multi
they operate on a different level of reality, is how i've come to understand it
i never liked vriska personality-wise
imagine if that was a real person
how could i forget
wait so bam, how close is homestuck.exe to being done would you say
still, that's incredibl
given the comic's decay you're undertaking possibly the most important preservation project in the history of the fandom
i mean, depends on the scale you're talking about
homestuck will completely cease to exist at SOME point, but within relative timescales, it's more a problem with the fact that the owners of the website seem completely disinterested in maintaining the comic properly
homestuck.com will probably persist for at least a handful of years but it's already broken in a number of ways that are variously significant
lat that's really fucking weird
do you mean you lik seriously, genuinely hate him or is it the casual kind of "this character sucks i do not care for them"
that's perfectly fine
she certainly didn't cause all of his flaws but i don't think literally crippling him for fun helped either
i would be more sympathetic to your argument if the exchange of weirdness/misfortune was a little more equal
but really what it is, is that on one side you have a guy who's a thorough social fuck up and in dire need of a therapist, and on the other hand you have a girl who's a thorough social fuck up and in dire need of a therapist who _controls people's minds in order to kill or torture them in various manners_
these are clearly not the same thing
i was going to say, don't you love cronus or some shit
that automatically invalidates not just your argument, but your entire existence
he's not even on the fucking scale, tavros may be boring but he has screen time and at least a semblance of an arc
god i wish i could stay up for this discourse
i haven't seen a set up this spicy in ages
you also said some nonsense about him being a statement about ableism rather than simply being kind of a weenie who gets pushed around a lot as a joke
i'm not really sure what the point of either of those truths is though
bah, you know what, it's too late for me to be discussing this
my brain is losing steam, i sleep
<@!125433170047795200> _oh no it's today_
honestly why can't we bring back telegrams
kids these days, no imagination i tell ya
hell no dero
doctorates are typically 3-5 year programs
4 years high school + 4 years undergraduate school + 4 years graduate school, sure, but no one counts it like that
oh
no, masters are 2 years
typically
and you can go straight from bachelors to phd, which is what i did initially before i realized academia fucking sucks my balls
i mean, it did, it took me 3 years because i switched out of my doctorate program last semester
and also virginia tech has a rotation program where you spend one year finding a laboratory to work in permanently
gnawms stop shitposting off topic
please, sir, can i have another pardon
the movie is not that great
it's passable but the book has a lot more spirit to it
<:ree:475542526791516170>
you should be
you won't know when the axe is coming, but rest assured
it waits
yeah we've been using <:ree:475542526791516170> for years now i think
it's a quality emote
no idea
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
beat you to it bitch
anyway mother of learning was interesting
i had some thoughts about it before i went to bed
i'm impressed that the groundhog day plot worked as well as it did with the almost worm-style buildup
i feel as if mol did a much better job with the scenes where it's supposed to show them settling down for a day or two and relaxing because no one can be on the ball like that constantly
however the final confrontation didn't feel as satisfying by comparison, not even close
it was still a much better ending than it had any right to be, but most of it was "fuck yeah that's cool" rather than any sense of real trepidation or concern that they wouldn't be able to pull it out at the end, y'know
anyway it was pretty good 7.5/10 at the very least
we should watch the man from earth today, i have it ready to go
yes
i was going to say, it looks like it was record with my asshole
i don't have the patience for this

not according to tensei
if you experience the same piece of media more than once, he'll trot out the spinning wheels gif
his doctor claims he's "the healthiest man alive" because if he didn't trump would fire him, but you just have to take one look at him wearing anything other than those oversized suits to see that he's very overweight
it might not be morbid obesity but he's definitely not fit
that's precisely the one i was thinking about, let me grab it

there's a disturbing number of edits of this image
funny you should mention that veli
order UP
tensei, hastily covering his tracks
makin, when the shills fell
i mean, by their own admission, money plane is not that funny of a movie, it's more of an exercise in trying to figure out how and why a movie could be so bad
their treatment of the movie is fucking hilarious though
let me repost the ending of mike's appraisal of the movie hold on
"It's certainly interesting from a movie-making perspective, it's just baffling, and terrible... and-and how bad something could be--" Money Plane. "--in-and not in a charming way." Got a bad feeling about this, things are going south. "In kind of a disgusting way. I felt like I wanted to throw up after watching it, like in a way where I felt sorry for everyone involved in it, all the actors, I felt like sick--" Money Plane. "--like embarrassed--" Bunch of bitches. "--you know what I mean? As myself, as a viewer, like sick. After-after like maybe an hour of it, I felt sick that something could exist made by human beings that is so bad. I felt literally nauseous."

"So you would recommend it?"

" Yeah."
rlm episode on it
how to weep, the weepy-weep way
with paul castorzano
zoinks!
we had enoguh people say aye, the man from earth happens in 30 minutes
life, nat
i'm on _life_
support
i think the confederate flag has somehow wiped itself from my memory, i cannot remember what it looks like at all
my mind immediately turns to the flag of the UK
that's really inopportune timing
let's see how quickly i can get through this
thanks dingus, was about to do it myself
can't wait to see our membership plummet from official content coming out
<@&693935623966425219> in ten minutes or so we're going to be doing the man from earth, don't worry too much about getting in right away cuz there's a homestuck 2 update, just try to be in by the turn of the hour <https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight>
also yes i agree with that makin
dingus already published

i don't know why this amuses me as much as it does
post pulp cat
REMEMBER: YOU'RE HERE FOREVER
yes, good
this sustains me
the shills taint
the fictional cornholio
what does mikez do again
besides be a creepy asshole to his employees--ah
yes, i think that's the question lat
if this person is JUST posting about it publicly, that raises its own question of "why"
er
no, hold on
i just sat down and i'm too fat so the blood all rushed to my head and made me confused
i don't know, it depends on what the goal of the employee _is_
are they simply doing as you said and posting it as an explanation to those who are curious?
mikez is accused of being abusive and a bad employer, that would probably affect his prospects of hiring future employees
i mean
you should probably be asking for proof of serious accusations, that's just how that works
lat are you okay
are you running a fever
lat this is very frustrating
it's like you're not actually crafting any kind of argument
you're just latching on to the last thing people said and then going from there
never happened
not this time
lat, i'm going to compile the points of this argument: you're saying that this former employee is allowed to say "i'm quitting" without any further scrutiny because that statement alone does not impact the company or its owner
this is correct, BUT
that is not what happened here
this person posted something that had more in-depth reasoning that is actually damaging ("Runs an unsafe work environment" is an actual thing that companies can get shit on for, as well as individual employees or owners) and then they provided basically no evidence explaining these claims
even if they DID have the evidence to back up their claims, it probably shouldn't be on twitter unless it's something that's already been swept under the rug and they don't have any recourse to handle at that point
do you understand why we're so irritated with your roundabout arguments and how you've chosen to approach this
this employee did NOT just say "i quit" with no further explanation, if they had then that would be the end of it
yes, if there's something happening that merits an investigation between people who are connected via a contract, it shouldn't be discussed on a public basis unless there's some kind of arrangement in place that allows that
this stuff has like actual due process
all this and i still need to read the homestuck 2 update
wait, what
so what was the thing that happened with dave's eyes? i didn't notice anything
yeah what
that's karkat's sock
is that what people were freaking out over
oh yeah no, i see now
it's kind of messed up but i took it for granted as a stylistic choice
like, it's clear what it's supposed to be
yeah, that's how i feel about it qweq
i'm fairly certain that homestuck original had something like this at various points
where the perspective on the glasses was incorrect but kept it that way for stylistic purposes
i talked about the pacing a couple times on the sub enemy
it's not just a matter of How Much Narrative Progress We're Seeing, it's a matter of how it's presented
homestuck 2 might be progressing faster narratively--wish i'm no longer sure is true incidentally--but the amount of pages that they're using to show it is way smaller, so it leads to this weird feeling of like time stretching
where it feels like the comic should both be farther than it is due to how fast the plot beats are happening within each update and how much real-life time is passing, but it should also be slower because they're only like 300 pages in
yeah, no
makin, usually when updates happen, even with everything that had happened this year, i felt a little excited to open up a page
my heart would beat just a little faster as i thought "oh, update! i wonder what it'll be"
this is the first time where that didn't happen
i heard there was an update for hs2, opened up the pages, read them, closed them, and i felt literally nothing
yeah that's good art to be fair
kudos to that artist
user5 was skeletonfucker69696969 or whatever
anyway, i see a lot of people on the sub thread saying this update was great and i just don't understand
i'm glad they're enjoying it but i feel like i'm looking through a window at someone else's party at this point
<:GONE:696509069233487972>
all the energy has been sucked out of my body
i was really kind of bored with the first 45 minutes
it wasn't until they got to the meat of it that i was actually invested
i thought that the characters--though i cannot for the life of me remember their names other than john jesus christ oldman--all interplayed with each other extremely well
the acting almost teetered on hokey every once in a while but was mostly solid
oh my god
you know what this reminds me of, actually? a christian propaganda movie i saw once called "the omega code"
that movie sucked donkey balls
i think people are too obsessed with the _internal_ character drama in hs at this point
yes homestuck had its fair smattering of internal consideration but most of the conflict was external in nature
disparate groups fighting each other
i don't know, i had a lot more i wanted to say about it but i almost feel like i can't get enough motivation to do so
why is everything so extra today
god damn i just want to lay down and nap
now i'm being assaulted by the world and its predilection for awfulness
you know what i had to deal with today
today my grandma was hanging out in the living room drawing in a coloring book, and out of nowhere she says, "you know what the dragons used to do?"
me, sighing: "no grandma what did they do"
"they protected... the earth." she pauses for a second, "but they aren't around anymore."
"alright grandma i'm sure"
later she asked me for help with her computer and said "what do i do to get out of this"
i went and looked and she was typing her fucking laptop password into google
you know what she was trying to do? she wanted to insert an SD card into her computer so she could look at pictures
i don't know how this happens
i don't know, if i'm being perfectly honest i thought it was funny she was googling her laptop password
but otherwise yes, this has been pretty rough
oh
no, the dragon thing
i don't know if that's dementa
there are other things happening that clearly imply dementia, like her asking things repeatedly and not remembering
that shit sucks
the dragon stuff is because she's fucking batshit in normal ways
like, she believes humans are the result of aliens from a 10th planet called tiamat coming to earth to take our gold, and engineering a slave species from their own DNA and chimpanzees
which one
okay very funny
no she got this idea from a book called "slave species of god" by some prick called michael tellinger
lmao
battlefield earth was written by ron l hubbard and travolta specifically wanted to act in the film because he's a scientologist
no she's an avid conspiracy theorist
other things she seriously believes: weather is controlled by a government facility up in alaska; there are entrances to secret molemen societies located at the north and south poles
yeah i'm part of the hsd
H ail
S atan and
D ogs
people who eat meat rare frighten me
lmao
i prefer my meat medium
hurray man, it's today
i was just quoting the comic don't yell at me
you want me to be roast beef as usual
"oh no it's today"
maybe later tonight woc
i have personal business to attend to
Indeed
I shouldn't have seen that
I should NOT have seen that
shameful
inexcusable
explain yourself, philistine
or don't, that's cool too
off the table

at all
vagueposting, the bane of my existence
speak SENSE
i had never looked into john dies at the end at any point in my life and now i'm going through it
this shit is fucking insane
i love it
this is easily the shill i've laughed most at
```I heard a metallic thump from behind me and heard John yell, ‚ÄúYou wants the committee, asshole, then you best meet with the chair!‚Äù```
i'm losing it
i don't think so
i might just have to read them too
the subreddit thread for it had largely positive responses, which baffled me
i don't know that i thought it was bad but it felt like basically nothing
but then, i personally felt nothing inside while reading it so that's not surprising
does it??
please explain
oh dear fucking christ
i hate homestuck
just let my nightmare end
i just got a blinding image of homestuck stretched out like butter on an infinitely long slice of bread
yeah no bam the point of my metaphor was that all of this is wearing increasingly thin
i am not excited for the thought of homestuck's setting being dragged out for an indeterminate amount of time
star wars has been we--are you being facetious
are you making fun of me
I FUCKING LOVE integrity and people who are principled
okay bam i was starting to question my sanity whenever i read your sentences
like for a second i was getting vertigo while trying to contemplate what you were saying
i think you're being very disingenuous
the jawas are not big parts of a new hope in the slightest, they sell the droids and are gone
they fulfill their purpose as weird aliens who sell junk
gremlin yoda is not a problem in the slightest, his stature is a brilliant storytelling twist where you expect this incredible space warrior but it turns out to be this little mischievous imp where there's more to him than meets the eye
the ewoks... there's no defense for them
but jarjar binks is there through the entire fucking movie
he never goes away
i don't want to remember
homestuck 2 should have started like this: completely unrelated beginning, new kids, new earth (maybe the same earth as before, just different kids)
everything goes awry like before, allusions to original homestuck
sylladex shenanigans
maybe not as much
no, bam
i don't want any fucking teen romance bullshit
none of that
they get in like normal, they learn what sburb is like
they go through some shit
then dirk shows up
have it be a fucking knockout twist
that would have been great
alternatively, it should have been an AU crossover between homestuck and beyblades
anyway, i guess a continuation of homestuck 2 would have been fine
my problem is less in the concept and more in the execution
i mean, the concept as it is now is kind of whatever, but god
the prattles are fucking infuriating
yeah, basically bam
homestuck should probably have been retired after the epilogues
i'm honestly surprised how many people hated the epilogues
even with its non-ending i felt like it was a perfect capstone to the story
hm
decent and competent are more or less equivalent
they're both vaguely above mediocre
bam i don't think anyone realistically holds any given person to the standard of early homestuck hussie output
that's completely unreasonable and evidently unhealthy
but that's not really what's happening
we're talking about a full team of multiple people who were all presumably handpicked by hussie or his subordinates to be involved with a direct continuation of his property
and they're engaging with the work in a way that's almost antithetical to how it was done before
i'm not talking about their rate of release, although it's already bad for reasons that should be obvious, but i more mean their treatment of the medium itself
the style is also a thing that deserves discussion but i want to talk about the mere way they form the content
the prattles are immediately something that sticks out like a sore thumb as something that does not fit
prattles are a blatant excuse not to express things visually when it would be too much effort to do so, further backed up by pip's rant about the comic "never using flash"
yes, they did
had a suggestion box up for it
no one believed for a second that it was actually community picked
or i'm sure someone did, but they were dumm
if yiffy had been community picked, i wouldn't even have been mad
at least that would have shown some kind of genuine community involvement, some kind of integrity
and none of this is to comment on the fact that the creators of this property are variously actively hostile to the fandom at large or have no problem with members of their team being so
even if homestuck 2 was fucking great i wouldn't be comfortable with it purely because the people handling it appear to be vile and contemptuous
cruuk, emerging from the depths of the lurker realm
good to see you mate
clearly what needs to be done is we need to inject some fucking black tar heroin into homestuck 2's veins
really send that shit into outerspace you know what i mean
<:dabeegMayahn:679423476268007424>
BRING BACK THE FUCKING SOPOR SLIME
holy shit thank you negadrew, that's almost precisely how i feel about it
it's like i can't turn my face away because there's this little sign above it that says "we're technically official"
it's flashing neon
vast error has all of the staples of a "proper homestuck story," yes
i am also not terribly interested in it and of the opinion that it takes too fucking long to get anywhere
but it's at least GOING SOMEWHERE and has arguably good quality going for it
the production quality actually kind of justifies how long it takes as an unofficial, unpaid property
with consistently decent bordering on good or even great music, numerous flashes, novel characters
it's fucking amazing in comparison honestly
and i don't even like it
i didn't say good characters, i said novel
as in, they're trying something different enough
yeah, they're not carbon copies of homestuck characters
that's enough to distinguish them in my book
despite all of my bitching about homestuck 2 i'm really not that hard to please
which should be a sign of how bad homestuck 2 is
although in fairness to the story itself, i am extremely biased against the people making it
so i guess it's not really a fair appraisal
they accused us of being a child porn ring and sex abusers
and then when we asked for an apology/some kind of action to rectify this we got asked what the gender makeup of our team was and then when i told hussie we were very unhappy about this invasion of our privacy he demanded i replace most of the mod team
that should tell anyone all they need to know about how fucked up the team's priorities are and their general attitude to fan communities
i'm not sure what universe a person needs to be in to justify that kind of thing to themselves
i and plenty of others used to be hopeful that hussie was kind of distanced from this stuff, like in an ivory tower of sorts
but i think his attitude or maybe even his own priorities as a whole is what allowed this culture to take form in his team
as they say, a fish rots from the head down
i don't know man, i'm just 500% disillusioned with homestuck now, and i have no faith that people on the official team will be able to pull it out of the fire because they're too concerned with picking fights with fans because they're unprofessional buffoons
i would LOVE to be proven wrong, i enjoyed homestuck so much that i want it to succeed as a property
but it's almost like, to what end? why should i support this work when the people in charge of it are these transparently unethical goons?
so yes, as i've said many times in the last month or two, i'm in it for the people now and not the story
alright we don't need to cross over into proselytizing territory
i don't encourage skyplayer with her weird communist shilling, i also don't feel comfortable with people saying "you are literally evil for supporting this work and you should be ashamed"
no of course not
but it's probably wise to try and avoid fucking up the same way twice
did you pick one up
you did not say you didn't get one you just said you weren't riding one
do not lie to my fucking face
anyway you should have picked _me_ one up
nevermind

anyway referenceposting _is_ shitposting, but as with all shitposting, it's only bad if it's sufficiently off topic or uncalled for
linkybot giveth freddy got fingered references, and thus we follow in his footsteps
but here, let's go back
what were we talking about before
no bam
my loyalty is not to homestuck as a property, it's to the members of this community
people don't get herpes just from looking at your breasts
i'm sure if someone could get AIDS from looking at my belly button, shirts would be way more mandatory than they currently are
also what do you mean bam
oh, well basically
if the official team want a community where they can curate responses and tightly control what people say about their property, they would be better off making their own discord server
i would honestly like to see that, if only so i could keep track of how it develops
i would be _very_ interested to see how active it becomes
yeah probably not
you joke solar but i seriously got questioned why i wasn't personally vetting every single member of our server before letting them in
it's like they operate on a different plane of existence
bah, probably tearing themselves apart internally
i wonder what precisely ignited the talk of striking
why is hiveswap like this terrible black hole of drama and development hell
how is it possible for an indie game to get fucked up this badly
becomeimp is practically ancient history at this point sky
SAY IT
time is a wheel, sky
we will be here forever, screaming as we tumble into the future, dragged against our wills as fate exercises its horrible will on us
is discord fucking up for anyone else

It begins
Not whatever the shotty Alexa bot thing is, but I'm going TROUT FISHING
I will probably be very inactive until tomorrow evening
<@146014279529791488> give them the skinny while I get up and prepare
What did I miss today
Thanks sky
Trizzaposter is the best
this campground has _excellent_ 4G signal, i turned my phone into a hotspot and i'm a-okay
second one definitely
fishing went well today, gonna share an image from my bigger catch in gen
went trout fishing today, caught two fish and the second one was pretty nice

you wish, baby
we're gonna eat it tomorrow morning

<@!207991389613457408> i'm having a nice bourbon-laden cigar, whatever that means, and i gotta admit i'm not getting as much out of it as i wanted?
i'm sure you know at this point that i enjoy this kind of thing for the way it makes me feel, and this isn't making me feel like much of anything
kind of why i like alcohol so much
THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, i am greatly enjoying this as a social activity, just like so many years ago
dero and i are having a great time
thank u bones
and with that, i am done with the shills list
again
<@!120187484863856640> put me back on the completionists list mofucka
they were genuinely good stories
Bweeeeee
Get in the fackin' caaahr
that's quality dingus, thank you
anyway, i'm back from my trip and boy howdy was it fucking great
did i miss anything today or was it as boring as yesterday
good job
that was like yesterday
can i help you
nah
i mean, if they want to hear then sure
but otherwise i'm not gonna force them to listen to... _shudder_ fishing stories
what are we, 80 year old grandpas
god damn you son of a bitch
of course you'd hook a lunker
too bad you didn't get it
anyway, the place is fucking beautiful
the water comes right out of a ground spring so it's all blue and shit
but when the water shallows out it's clear as crystal, so you can see all of the fish swimming around in places
and there's literally hundreds of thousands of trout milling about, to the point that they just swim around you when you wade in the water
not that great
i don't think i'll be doing it again
i mean, i enjoyed it _enough_ but it didn't really do anything for me
i might make it a tradition to bring a small cigar each time i go to the springs, just as a celebratory deal
but otherwise i'm not that big of a fan
oh yeah, one fishing story worth telling
i snagged a smallish trout in the middle of the day and successfully got him netted, but as i was taking the hook out i saw something flashing in its gills
it looked like a fucking nugget of gold, and i was just completely mystified for a second
but it turns out this fish had been caught or swallowed a hook before at some point, because it was another fly called a "trout magnet" that has this rough knob at one end painted golden
so i took that one out too and pocketed it
baby one more time
yeah i'm taking it easy cuz i'm fucking bushed
it's fun, i highly recommend it for anyone who wants to go outside but doesn't want to expend obvious physical effort
i hate standing up for extended periods of time even in optimal conditions, i was standing waist deep in freezing water for several hours and barely even noticed it
i probably also have mondo sunburn so there's that

brotherhood has a resolution to its story that's actually cohesive with the rest of the anime
the original anime run deviates in a way that almost feels like a fucking fever dream
and i appreciate it for that
i think the deviation is also highly enjoyable for various reasons, mostly because it oozes strangeness compared to what came before
really breaks the story up in an interesting way

the biggest problem with wwhd is that it's only available for the wii u
i also want to point out that wwhd was released in 2013, which means we're coming up on a decade since it came out
i ALSO want to point out that wind waker originally came out in 2002, so we're nearing 20 years of it being out

shove those thunderstorms straight up my ass
i don't think so?
maybe tipsy did one
so many fucking pings
you displease me
conservative estimates have it at 100 bucks a month for service and 300 for initial set up
yes
satellite internet is already a thing in most places
you have a satellite dish that receives and transmits signals from satellites in orbit, which causes really high latency but allows you to reach geographically isolated areas
starlink is going to eliminate the latency issue and make the speed higher
even if the upfront costs and internet itself are costly, i would accept it for that alone
older internet relay satellites are also way more expensive than what starlink is trying to do
the LEO starlink satellites are specifically designed to be replaceable, especially tied with spacex
you would need a constant march of satellites in polar orbit, which is WAY harder to do than equatorial orbit
you can't just launch your rockets north or south, you still have to start going equatorial in order to avoid dropping your rockets on an inhabited landmass
and to take advantage of the spin of the earth
also yes
yeah makin, it costs approximately 4 times the fuel of an equatorial launch to get into polar orbit
wait
hold on, that's not right
maybe starlink will expand to the poles eventually
i'd love to see that
well yeah of course it can be done, it's just that the logistics make it more complicated/more expensive
also the fact that like a handful of people live in those areas makes it not cost effective
musk is the kind of bastard who'd say "who cares though i mean it when i say ALL of the earth needs internet" though
we need to start launching more telescopes into space to counter this problem
ground observatories often rent out their services to various astronomers across th globe
overcome the starlink satellite problem by making more observatories in space
it's like these people don't even thonk right
i was speaking as opposed to a crew that mans the observatory constantly but sure
yes
wait what
cheeze was asking about polar orbit
wait, am i losing my fucking mind
no, his question is specifically "is it easier to do polar orbit in a scenario where the earth is not spinning"
there is definitely some aspect of the earth's rotation that makes it easier to do equatorial versus polar orbits
the number of times i've tried to hit moho and failed is embarrassing
i managed to get to the point where i have an intercept and a collision course but i can't land on the son of a bitch

no the mod worked, it just wasn't terribly fun
didn't work very intuitively
wait what? i haven't heard of this
no i was talking to krato, but has this actually become useable
i remember it being hypothetical last time i heard about it
wait, really

i would never talk about valve without also factoring in steam
yep, that's what i fear
GoG was the only online game library i could find that had the chronicles of riddick games
that is literally the only stuff i use it for
escape from butcher bay and assault on dark athena are both really fucking good for being based loosely on films
i mean, overpromising just to underdeliver for whatever reason is definitely worthy of being lambasted over
so hiveswap is essentially dead, right
we circle ever closer to the drain
that is a fucking excellent name
after all, no one's ever really gone

tipsy called me "some fuck" in mod chat and it hurt my fee fees
she also accused me of not giving a shit about homestuck, so i calmly screamed at her why she was wrong
that's the best one in a while
also yeah, i keep saying the reason i get upset with new updates is because i _care_
why would i bother getting worked up if i didn't give a single shit about homestuck or what it's like
<:loss:660286279132512267>
the only thing i missed was 6/12
we did april fool's day and 4/13 like normal
how much shit did makin do outside of those things
like, besides meme dates and april fool's day i don't think there was anything that he did regualrly
i literally have a minecraft server up right now that i pay for every month
i also paid for a terraria server when the journey's end update came out
makin does streams every weekend for _months_
you: <:CDiLink:589195446744907777> SURE IS BORING AROUND HERE
also yeah
i'm pretty sure
might have turned off at some point but i still get a fuckin' bill each month
YEAH WELL WHOSE FAULT IS THAT
IT'S YOURS, STINK MAN
no he fucking didn't
no he _didn't_
again, you can't plan flavor of the month games
he fished the waters a bit to see if people wanted to play a thing and if they did, he made a server
he did not PLAN those things, i'm pretty sure
get out
also wasn't tensei talking about fall guys
how about we make that flavor of the month since that's how that works
did lat actually complete that bet
is there a video of lat lifting 40 pounds with his mouth
<@!111477124384202752> i'm going to ban you
i am not in the mood to be fucked with
fine, i will uphold my side of the bargain
behold: <#187028510848712704>
so does literally everything else
if you want a server you need to shell out money STOOPIT
yes, you're welcome
for which you have my deepest gratitude
all behold your new lord and master: <@!227181775221161984>
no
no, he just owns your asses now
because i can
anyway let me summarize it: lat and i made a bet a couple weeks ago that he couldn't lift 40 pounds with his neck and head, he did it, now this channel is renamed for a week to two weeks or however long i feel like it deal w/ it

suck my dick i'm pickle linky
<@!542086093776879616> you deserve death
I AM THE HARBINGER
if i can't trust people on the internet with little to no oversight, who CAN i trust?
indeed
what's the worst thing you ever read, do you think
good night everybody
gnawms will experience scene-setting when moving from plot point to plot point and call it exposition
you're just a punk who doesn't appreciate the finer details
fancy a scrum, lad? i'll show you wot's wot
if i'm thinking of the scene you're describing, i don't think that was a _flashback_
i'm pretty sure it was like being transported to the moment as an external observer
terezi would call people who use the internet too much gay and go back to hanging stuffed animals from her tree branches
i don't remember this, can you send me a video if it
suddenly not sure i'm thinking of the same thing
gnawms it's not the same sprite
reti misled you
the other one's horns are larger, more jagged
then reti still misled you because it's not a fucking flashback
it's like peeking into a different moment in time
but it's not YOUR MEMORY
actually you know what i just realized i'm being a moron
go back to calling me a dirt sifter i don't care anymore
isn't frontline something that keeps ticks and fleas off of your pets
ah, dextromethorphan
i did that once, it wasn't much to write home about
that wasn't the name of the gummies, that was the description of how i would feel when i took a certain number of them
they were correct
that's a dick move moon, shame on your old roommate
i don't even eat brie and that made me grimace
holy shit, what
tmtm: "i just found out about a drag queen named alaska thunderfuck 5000"
me:
holy _shit_
```A bizarre cosmic collision propelled Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 to Earth in March 1966‚Ä¶```
this is the best intro to a bio i have seen literally ever
alright, finished her bio and now i'm bored again
drag queens aren't all that amusing actually
not really git, my motivation for fake sports ended even before marble league
tera irl: "man why you gotta do a thing"
hm
our wordsa re backed with nuclear weapons!
relax, will ya? it's a toy, from _canada_. jeez, how embarrassing
miles o'brien doesn't deserve food, he's just a fucking transporter chief
<:eyes_fast:417208120859951105>
it's been a rather gentle evening throughout
that's some pretty cool shit
at a certain point, a work's importance escapes the confines of their original creator's bounds and assumes a broader gravity
what defines that work or signifies the validity of its continued creation is complicated, but it nonetheless is delineated somehow
star wars was created by george lucas but no longer is, yet people recognize certain entries in the franchise as valid over others
homestuck has passed hands from hussie to someone else, despite their claims to fandomwide ownership
it's a FARCE, in other words
homestuck in the general sense, not just homestuck 1
mostly homestuck 2
what i'm getting at is that with the state of current ownership and how they're _actually_ treating it, it baffles me that anyone can seriously purport that they've given up control of the story or given the fandom the ability to create their own "homestuck 2"
i mean, releasing the emails may have had some impact
as maya angelou said, when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time
no, i was just speaking in general
who cares
problematic is a buzzword
be true to yourself
loam, actually
i wonder when woc will pull the plug
fucking brapposting <:reeeeee:311032673386627074> get the fuck outta here
last warning, knock it off
idea for a new linkybot function: spat notations
i want to see that unironically
mirror universe HSD
about a week i think
the closest you can get is the google doc lat
er, sky rather
shut UP
someone get this up and running, i'd make a new section of the website for particularly funny entries
can someone teach me how to run instances of gpt at some point
it is a horrible idea but i want SPAT GPT to be a real thing
this is going to be a shit show, i can't wait
jesus fucking christ
this guy is from florida, calling it now
yeah, dependent on the tasks being asked of us i would probably not do TOO bad
if it's more physically oriented like running that would suck dick
but i love coming up with or thinking of alternative methods of communication
multivac is right: he's always wrong
me too! that's why i'm here today to show you my betamax x-z-300 toaster slash blend it
bitch finna swer
is he wrong
have you seen this yet tera https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog
<:LUL:311695618009726978>
rats are part of the order rodentia, which is the next step down from the class mammalia
dogs are part of the class carnivora, so zentoyo is correct, their main commonality is that they are both mammals
or not, either way
i fucking love that gaston ytp
the way it's constructed makes it feel like "Exercises in Making a YTP"
good job
yeah you can, just don't  out there with all of the files
what the fresh fuck is this <@!131650004606648320>
well thank ya
what do i look like, a boomer
not really sky, and we saw this coming from a mile away
maybe, but definitely not to the second one
i don't know, i think they were doomed from the start because they set goals that were way too low for something like this (1 update a month, 2 upon a patron threshold, with an average of less than a page per day of work)
and then they couldn't even meet THAT
we had two months in a row of hiatus
granted it is the time of covid-19 but come on
interestingly, yiffy is one of the very few elements from hs2 that's enjoyed somewhat sustained controversy and discussion so far
not a coincidence that it came from hussie
you know what the main difference is?
the update rate is far slower so people are able to concentrate on it for longer
so it makes people more agitated AND makes them more bored in the long run
you know, i'm going to be charitable about it
i can maybe see jade being secretive about it because she's nervous or ashamed
rose is much smarter than that though
yeah, we've complained often enough about lack of a plot or lack of plot movement
but that doesn't mean you should throw shit in that doesn't make any sense, or just for the fuck of it
i would be more okay with the pacing if the team's conveyance was better
we still don't know what the end goal at any given time is
i was actually really happy when we got on to deltritus or whatever and they were like "we're gonna create an entire new species and make them play sburb."
that's a weird goal, kind of interesting, and there's a PRODUCT you can look forward to
but then they did that and it fucking failed behind the scenes???
what the FUCK
now there's no goal again and we didn't even get to see all of the ways that dirk and rosebot fucked up
it makes me angry, it's just a complete waste
and you know what, i think that's the general problem
is that these writers aren't competent enough in any sense so that even if they happen to get one thing right, their other deficiencies start to poke through and fuck it up anyway
make an interesting plot point? skip past it real fast so it doesn't even matter and we go back to nothing
get to a spot with an excellent action scene just ripe for the picking? do a prattle instead and don't even show the fucking action
got a bunch of interesting characters grouped with each other with the potential for fun dynamics? skip around a lot and don't show any of them for more than a few pages in a row
at every turn there is SOMETHING they choose to do that ruins the pacing or the mystery or the fun
blowjobathan, ironically, is funnier and more clever than yiffy
it is
here's the thing though, it would only be funny as a throwaway gag
you can't have what's going to presumably be a main member of the cast be called blowjobathan because that's fucking retarded
qweq, we're taking back "retarded" you can get over it
i've held it in for years, but i've had enough
I'M GOING SICKO MODE
no but really, we decided ages ago that this was fine as server policy
did you not pick up on that
i didn't even hear about people trying to rename the character
that makes sense but i was not privy to it
yiffy, or as i like to call her, "i like to get fucked from behind"
yiffy, or as i like to call her, "vag"
yeah i'm giving sky a pass this one time because i participated in it so it would be hypocritical
also this is clearly like, not sincere horny
but still, let's move on because this is getting rather sordid
dero stay on topic
yeah no advertising ourselves as an 18+ server, regardless of why, would attract all kinds of weirdoes and perverts we don't want here
it wouldn't keep children off of here either
https://tenor.com/view/peggle-peggle2-two-e3-meme-gif-15554864
coronavirus... 2!
remember harpy, you're here forever
sky, inviting overtly sexual content or discussion in a server for a property that attracts children is a fucking awful idea
we got accused of being child molestors even though we take every step possible to keep this place sanitized, can you imagine the kind of accusations we'd get if we just allowed it to run rampant or still had the nsfw channel/servers
hell, i didn't become fully cognizant until i was in college, and i didn't fully comprehend my actions until i was in _graduate_ school
and i'm sure that awareness and understanding is just going to keep increasing as i get older
what things will be obviously stupid to me that i engage in freely now
yeah dingus, in retrospect it's not obvious to any of us why we even bothered entertaining hussie's requests
he had basically no ground to stand on
i'm 99% sure it's because we were scared of the possibility of legal action, given his vague threats of "getting heavyhanded"
if it hadn't been for that i'm pretty sure we would never have gone any further in negotiations
but now with the power of hindsight, it's like
it's hard not to look back and say it was an entirely stupid interaction
lat, you are a moron
there is continuous mental development in people all the way up until their 25, and potentially beyond
just because you don't consciously register that it's happening doesn't mean it isn't the case
then that reflects more on you than anything else
get smarter
sky you also post inappropriately horny shit literally every day in chat, so maybe being cavalier about it isn't the best reaction
it also has literally nothing to do with redistribution of wealth, which i think most people in here think is a good idea
a child porn ring no less
honestly the proportion of cis and trans people here is fucking outrageous
compared to more typical demographics
when can we abandon our flesh prisons and become a hive mind
sky our point is that arguing on lines like this is kind of pointless because it's not actually what matters all that much
people who abandon their principles and reason in favor of identity politics have no scruples and actively harm discussion that would be to everyone's benefit
no, it's not lat
<@!227181775221161984> you're conflating your own experience with what everyone else experiences too
i have no idea what being trans is about but you're the only person i've ever heard describe it in that manner
HOOOOOOOOOO boy
that's... horrible
the kartakovsky shorts are extremely good
at this point we should just start calling you "bad opinions man"
i have rarely been graced by the presence of someone who has said so many weird and headturning things about media
no for sure mint
part of the enjoyment is in sussing out the degree and extent to which someone believes such things
i don't want to make lat feel bad, i'm just mystified
wait what's this
give me link i'm lazy
this looks fun
what
hey brooke
also do i need to knock some HEADS
<:SwiftRage:242482016786841600>
26
yeah don't throw shade at dirt üî™
they did some of that but not very well
hussie and WP have never understood how to actually do PR
the evidence for this is ample and abundant
god, who could have foreseen that we looked back on cohen's tenure in this fandom even remotely _favorably_
there's talk of the equal rights act being ratified as an amendment but it's kind of touch and go with the current administration fucking things up
we need another state or two to add and then it should be good though
so fucking bizarre
man that teaching assistant really got fucked
dragonball and dbz are pretty different
dragonball is like a proper adventure story and dbz is straight up people beating the shit out of each other, at least when it matters
the original run had a lot of filler that kind of tried to reinject that adventure element but it SUCKED at it, which is why i just advocate to watch kai
they don't need to be, their characters are practically fully established the first panel you meet them
dragonball isn't a character driven story, it's about seeing this little kid you already like and you want to witness him get bigger and stronger
i forget the name of that kind of arc but db pulls it off flawlessly
sounds like a you problem
<#505836815014559744>
er, <#187028510848712704> rather
it's in archived private channels, i don't remember why
some bullshit
yah
it's usually illuminati hangout but these chucklefucks keep trying to actually hangout in there despite it being a joke, so i changed it to what makin has had for centuries
any questions
what has gotten into you today
we ban people for less than this
also put me back on the shill completionists list
eloze is my shill, don't bother reading it because i know you won't like it
SNAP SNAP
i don't know, achewood is pretty good if not rational
it's like a fine wine
you have to really study it or concentrate to enjoy its subtler qualities, but it also gets you drunk so you're having a fun time regardless
achewood is a very long comic strip with a lot of moving elements
sometimes it is just a sensible chuckel
but other times, it is harrowing
just ask woc about "the only game in town" or roast beef's depression
also there's a lot of genuinely cultured information in here
but you wouldn't appreciate that because you're a wiener who enjoys plumbing the depths of star wars worldbuilding
love--
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
aight
language, soz
i need to play mgs yeah
i tried to play 1 and found it completely baffling and miserable, stopped 5 minutes in
doesn't help that ps1 emulation sucks every cock in the universe
sigh
yeah i know misha
here's my game plan for the foreseeable future when it comes to enjoying media
1) finish achewood 2) resume higurashi and hopefully finish it 3) ??? something here but i don't remember, probably a video game or something
and now i've added 4) try playing mgs or deus ex again
does someone feel like helping us design a new subreddit banner
nothing complicated, we already have the idea hammered out for the most part
wrow
well let me see if i can take a crack at it
We're making a change to our Homestuck category of channels: we've noticed an influx of new readers who actually haven't experienced Homestuck or related stuff yet. As such, we're repurposing the Homestuck Games channel (which is chronically inactive) to be about Homestuck 2 and other Homestuck "sequel material," such as the Epilogues or the video games. 

What this means: <#530564260720410644> is going to be for discussion of the original comic _only,_ and optimally it should be a spoiler-safe environment for newer readers. Thus, if discussing anything that would be a spoiler for people currently talking in the channel, please use tags. People going out of their way to spoil new readers will be punished severely for doing so.

Conversely, <#434426651280015371> is now for discussion of Homestuck Epilogues, Hiveswap, Friendsim, Pesterquest, and Homestuck 2. Discussion of elements from the original Homestuck is also fine here, given its general importance. _This is a spoiler zone, so new readers should take care if stepping in._ Hopefully this will give a safe space for newer readers of the webcomic, as well as making it easier to handle the overflow of discussion when any new updates come out. 

This is a tentative change: if we find that this arrangement doesn't work or if there's a better way to do it, we'll probably shift it around in the coming months. If you have suggestions, let us know in <#152981670507577344> or <#434426651280015371>. Thanks for your cooperation, and hopefully the new arrangement works better for everyone!

i don't know that it's possible for microsoft to outright prevent you from installing it to your machine
but i'm a wiener who knows little about computers, so nevermind what i think
what a strange name for a street
maybe this town is so small that there is only a single street that is just the town's name
kind of like how the buildings on college campuses are often their own addresses
yes, this makes perfect sense
30 minutes or until we get annoyed
i mean
neither type of reader is _better_
but there is a definite difference in the qualities of each type of reading
there is absolutely a different culture that arises from the manic excitement of waiting for new updates
there were entire programs dedicated to just letting people know "a new homestuck update is out!"
we'd have some time to discuss developments from each set of panels and then the next update would be out
this is way different from just reading the entire comic through at your leisure
yeah
linkybot is definitely not on point tonight
yesterday was legit
it was indeed a good thing
compared to what we have now at least
i would infinitely prefer how things were back then to how they are now
boundless excitement and mystery
as opposed to general discontent and boredom
it's true though
uh oh
lmao
this is more like it
sigh, fine

see you tomorrow linkybot
nor horny
knock it off, next topic
god DAMMIT
do it
now
<@!338881173268987904> exercise the responsibility of your position
strike down these nuts or suffer the consequences
god luck woc
why is star trek making the mistake of adding more and more references to popular culture as time goes by
that shit should have stopped with the original seris
as much as i liked stephen hawking beating data at poker or whatever, it shouldn't have happened
stop dating your references
<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
i was going to say mint, that sounds like what some of us do all day _already_
because you just got GNOMED

why hello there b3es

it's still standing... for now
just wait until 2020 gets to it
i believe cristo redentor is steel frame with plaster exterior
deathist rhetoric has always been a subject of ridicule in here
wati what husky are you serious
there's some beatdowns you can't come back from
i would genuinely be interested in that
we can do a small tourney style
8-16 people or however many
i dont' know how tournament brackets work
putnam would likely win though
i'd have to get it downloaded first and who knows how long THAT would take
it's from an alexander scott article about "quality conversations"
oh no
that's probably going to take all night
do it immediately
you can have flight over my cold, dead body
here's the deal: you can have flight if you finally acknowledge that christopher columbus was in all actuality a piece of shit who made things hell for the natives he encountered

you know, i think that most STEM fields contain at least a mild degree of overlap
so like for bio i also had to take chemistry classes, math, physics
after a few degrees i think you'd have taken most of the other courses through secondary courses alone
so it'd just be a matter of mopping up any niche ones you missed and then the capstone
the problem is that a bachelor's degree is basically the new high school diploma
so you wouldn't be netting yourself very much in the end
you have to plug yourself into a wall outlet to recharge
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
speaking of xacto knives
one time in high school i was working on a project that required fine cuts, so i was using an xacto knife to make some small cuts
well, at some point, i was cutting towards myself, and didn't notice the tip of my ring finger in the way
sliced it right off
i even found the tip on the floor later
you ever found a solid hunk of your own flesh?
it's a pretty weird experience
no i wrapped it in napkins and tossed it in the trash
oh yeah, a couple of times i was dragging my fingers across some wood paneling in the basement and got a splinter about half an inch long wedged right under my fingernail
i removed them myself with a set of tweezers
it was _reeeaaal_ uncomfortable feeling those slide out
this is officially in the top three of our worst conversations ever
congratulations: all of you participating have made HSD history
yeah man, accidents ain't no joke
glad you got out with JUST a scar
Who?
Holy fucking crap
It's always particularly tough when it happens to them like sub 60
And in his early 40s? Jesus fucking christ
i want a twitter bot that does nothing but post "Review: x is the worst y movie ever"
for every single movie to ever come out
"how can it be a star wars movie if it ain't got no STARS in it" - mike stoklasa probably
fuck
i don't know why, but that reminds me i still need to make a new banner for the subreddit
<:punctuation:305073440975486976>
an admin's job is never done
i'm thinking of keeping it bare bones as fuck
just skaia and the beta planets
i kind of want to rip it directly from like jack: ascend or whatever
there's some good stuff there
yeah, that too
we don't have a patreon but i wouldn't mind footing the bill for that i guess
gnawms he doesn't have hsd patreon money anymore, i dismantled it
i doubt he had that much to work with, he was funding game servers and stuff like that
i'm not willing to look into it
i mean
what if we have an art contest and then give them a small prize for it that isn't just "we use your art"
that makes way more sense than what i was thinking
is there anyone in particular we feel would be good for a job like this
i'm thinking not just a new banner but also a new splash image
this splash image is outdated and Problematic ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è according to a few people who care
so i want one with #ffffff skin instead
the kids are white so people bitch about it being racist occasioally
i don't care too much about that, but i also would like a version that's straight up paper white
indeedily
but nah, dumb tangent aside
i guess i'm like, reticent to do this, because i am poor
i wonder if it would be looked down upon to make a small pool for people to donate if they want
for these two things specifically
woc again that's not really the part i care about, it would just be one more thing that's taken care of as a result
the splash image has been around since splash images first became a thing and i want a new one, and i prefer all the characters depicted as like paper white
i'd like something new and simplistic, we're rebranding a bit to be more welcoming to new readers
woc you are a menace to society and i constantly ask myself why i haven't taken you out back behind the shed already
i never said i was actually thinking of doing an art contest
can you actually read
gnawms brought up art contests by way of "don't do them"
i said "at all? what if this"
he explained why that's a bad idea
i agreed and went back to not considering one
THAT WASN'T ME SAYING I WANT TO DO AN ART CONTEST, I WAS ASKING ABOUT A HYPOTHETICAL
holy shit i hate you so much it makes me want to rip my own entrails out just so i can beat you to death with them
the next time i see you in person i'm going to seismic toss you into next year, with my _cock_
woc it's nice to CHANGE SHIT every once in a while
people get bored of looking at the same fucking thing every day
there is no reason to change it other than to freshen things up you utter _reprobate_
banned
you're all banned
anyway i think setting up a pot for people to donate in EXPLICITLY for a commission to replace the current splash image and the subreddit banner isn't such a bad idea
get some community spirit going
fill those coffers
we're a club now
not really, i'm just spitballing
i would foot the bill myself but i really can't afford it right now, so i'll probably just end up not doing anything for a while
because sometimes talking about stuff gets people on board
misha if you do that i'll put it as the sidebar image for up to 3 days
it has to be as tasteful as possible
that being the only requirement, do whatever you want
i don't want people accusing us of pinning porn to the subreddit sidebar
giant boobs are one thing but don't make it so that like the areolas are three micrometers away from being uncovered
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i fucking hate you people
next person who talks about shitting or farting or posts furry images is getting banned
over my cold, lifeless corpse
harpy participates other times
just because you don't pay attention doesn't mean it doesn't happen, fool
<:foooooooooool:292673270199746561>
lit is fucking cursed tonight for some reason
we need to start beating the shit out of you guys
beavis and butthead has such choice quotes as `FIRE, FIRE, FIRE, FIRE, FIRE, FIRE, FIRE, FIRE, FIRE`, and `BREAKIN' THE LAW, BREAKIN' THE LAW`, and `Dumbass.`
who is the most punished character in achewood
one might be compelled to say roast beef but i'm actually going to say it's teodor
roast beef's demons are all inside of him, but teodor in this arc is ||literally kidnapped by nice pete to reenact high school, which in nice pete's mind means stripping teodor naked, tossing him in the back of a van and swerving around so he's battered and bruised and bleeding, kidnapping ANOTHER person and locking them up in the back together, and then teodor sucks the guy's cock while they both bleed all over the place||
here i'm just going to link the part
as opposed to the underaged relationship in homestuck between callie and roxy
get over yourself gnams
this is like that time i linked electric retard in chat and everyone immediately said "you need to delete that right now"
it was one of those times where my brain snapped in half and i did things before i was able to put it back together
anyway compared to electric retard this is way less bad and also doesn't even show on screen rape so i don't know what the fuck gnawms is on about
it's just teodor having a really, really bad night
he doesn't demand it, he just suggests that in the little time they have left, why leave life with any regrets
i'm fucking losing my shit
NO YOU JACKASS
i'm just laughing my tits off at this asinine shit
can't a man keep privvit his _lesser jubilations?!_
no, i still rule your ass
suffer for your crimes
bruh what the actual fuck, people went "this is completely inappropriate" and i deleted it within seconds
and i didn't actually post the achewood strip i've been describing
no, you guys are just being jackasses
violate the rule and see what happens
what??
the spoilered description?
this is
literally what happens in the comic
no we haven't
just describing the actual physical content of a comic? in spoiler tags??
you're pulling shit out of your ass
if i had linked it and went LOOK AT THESE PANELS
then yeah i would probably ban someone for that
but we have described way more tasteless shit than this without punishment
i'm kind of baffled that you guys are taking this so harshly
woc weren't you the one who wanted to gatekeep lit harder
here's your chance
get rid of the newbie scum who can't tolerate serious or disturbing conversations
man i am seriously like weirded out that my description has caused this kind of fallout
again, it's not like i posted individual frames and said "LOOK AT HOW THE LIGHT GOES OUT OF HIS EYES HERE, ISN'T IT SCRUMPTIOUS"
i literally gave a synopsis of what happened
what the fuck, are you actually angry
that was a _joke_
this entire night is a fucking garbage fire
i made a joke because i'm still in disbelief that people are this upset over something that's more or less innocuous to me
no, really, i don't see what's wrong with posting a synopsis
no, i have no problem backing down, i can tell that people are genuinely disturbed and that's making me worried
i still don't _understand_
we have talked about way worse than this in contexts like this one and had no problem
i also did not describe it in detail, i literally just posted a bare bones synopsis
yeah, to me this feels like an overreaction
<:annoyedPepe:347205246457610260>
what the actual fuck
no
i am completely sober
you are overreacting hardcore
it mostly is
achewood gets fucking heavy sometimes
i don't know, i posted a 
spoilered plot synopsis of an arc in achewood that covers a disturbing/graphic topic and people fucking jumped my ass for it
gnawms is acting like i killed his firstborn son
yes, it's not like i was glorifying it or reveling in it, it was literally just "this happens"
i'm seriously confused why that merits more than a "jesus christ that's graphic"
i'm actually getting fucking irritated at gnawms for acting like i've ruined the sanctity of this place somehow
WHAT
IT'S A FUCKING PLOT SYNOPSIS
<:punctuation:305073440975486976>
i'm being stubborn because this reaction feels completely disproportionate to what actually happened
jesus fucking christ, forget it
this conversation has spiraled out of control, so i'm ending it
you know what, fine
i still don't understand but it doesn't necessarily matter if i understand
clearly enough people are upset that i crossed some sort of line, and the onus is on me to respect that
i'll go delete the description and i'll take steps to avoid this kind of mistake in the future
now shut the fuck up and go back to talking about things that make us all happy instead
i'm not interested in discussing this further
as i said i still don't really understand how this was so fucking wrong
i'm basically acquiescing because there's like a consensus at work here and what i personally understand doesn't work within that consensus
i'm not even fucking tired and i'm really irked at the implication that it'll all make sense to me when i wake up
gritting my fucking teeth
i'll just DM you tera
no gnawms i just wish you wouldn't act like i shot your fucking pet dog in the face right in front of you
i would feel less defensive about it if it didn't feel like people were overreacting to an absurd degree about it
"put a content warning on your post," sure i get that
"jesus fucking christ drew what the actual fuck is wrong with you you deserve death"
i'm ANNOYED
but FINE
god, not even linkybot's on my side tonight
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
fushigi ball
no
you mean the guy who makes knives out of everything under the sun
yeah he's cool
this is fucking absurd
i'm going to look up the origin of the term weeaboo
<https://www.japanpowered.com/otaku-culture/am-i-a-weeaboo-what-does-weeaboo-mean-anyway>
fascinating
this particular knife is revolting
i think i will skip to the end
pretty sure the carbon knife is still king and will probably never be displaced
yeah, cahdwick boseman was _the_ black panther

can't wait to see how the knife gets twisted in my cranium this time
you old bastard
NOT THE BEAN PASTE BUNS
oh i bet it was
btw if it wasn't obvious i caught up on achewood last night
i feel kind of sad that it just got dropped like that
as it is i think i'm far from being in the minority when i say my favorite arc is the 3 day fight
3 DAYS, 3 ACRES, 3000 MEN
our every move is the new tradition
that sucks
yugioh tv show: "YOU SHOULD HAVE READ THE RULES: YOU LOSE."
also yugioh tv show: \*blatantly using a card the wrong way for the entire duration of the show's run*
i'm looking at you, sword's of revealing light
lmao
that sounds positively traumatic
please tell me it's still safe
that could turn out to be extremely valuable
a single original run holographic charizard is worth over 200 dollars
news to me
spiral don't be obtuse
x has multiple sounds and it's extremely uncmmon
is it like xylophone or paraxi
so "ksim"
jesus
what a horrible letter for a novel social concept
whoever decided on "xim" needs a stern fucking talking to
yawn

tomorrow possibly, yes
today no
yawn
GOING
POSTAL
i don't know what it is, i just know the phrase "going postal"
which always makes me think of the movie "falling down," which is a fucking excellent movie
orange is a nice color
yes, i was going to say
this is far more red than orange
it's practically dave's pesterchum color honestly, dirk's would be more appropriate
copyrighted by the dutch government
anyone who tries to use it that isn't a dutch citizen gets the fucking noose
what reti said, i'm fucking amazed how awful that is
<@!207991389613457408> nevermind this chapter is unofficially not fun anymore, cw: creepy sex pervert i guess
jesus christ
"WIPEY-WIPEY"
it makes me sad to realize there are real people like this
remember the morbidly obese fellow who shit himself and made a flight attendant wipe it up
are you not aware of this
prepare to be scarred for life https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3626455
that's even weirder thoguh, isn't it
to have a not-officially-but-still maid cafe that's staffed by your... family??
fits with the name, too
"oh fuck, it's the odd gentlemen again, hide your wallets"
"Reward no longer available" yeah that describes the entire franchise at this point
i need more husk emotes
withered is great
<@125433170047795200> Do you enjoy pissing other people off for fun?
<@153392726832840706> your casual racism has become distinctly uncomfortable, rein it in or die
<:Death:358798914641592320>
what in tarnation
i mean, it might be true but it's misleadingly worded is my only problem with it
that's neither here nor there thoguh i guess
yeah, sure, i meant that part
i don't know that i'd call it a problem, in the sense that it's not really problematic
there are tons of stories that just don't do romance
but if he's GOING to have romance in his plot, then it's definitely a _deficiency_
that too, sure
<:bred:684981349311971339>
fishing is relaxing as hell
i took the dive and bought a genuine fly fishing pole because i'm a fucking moron and i foresee myself doing this for a long, long time
it's just nice, y'kno
<@!207991389613457408> i want to point out that i made the claim of shion >>> mion when ||i still thought it was actually mion pretending to be a different person,|| now that i know this is no longer the case i am agitated at the trickery before me
also chapter 6 is starting off with the transparent blood splatters on the scenery and i can already feel the hair on the back of my neck standing on end
i wonder how things are going to get totally fuckedu p THIS time
my bet is on ||suicide||
either that or ||get fucked idiot üêî ||
yeah i'm actually kind of interested now
just needed to clear my to do list of other stuff
excuse me
you called my mother WHAT
i'm gonna come clean, i never read diary of a wimpy kid so i don't know what the context or joke is
i assume casei is cheese?
oh yeah, that tickles a few neurons in the back of my skull, just a little bit
fucking dead languages
why must i be interested in learning you
you had those too? thought that was a thing in my graduating class only
how does that happen in a hick town like ours in the first place
i actually agree with this
do it yourself OH WAIT
actually you know what, here
it's slow
30 minutes or until i get annoyed
nik, dero and i happened to grow up in a weird melange of liberalized college town with complete hick redneck farmer fuck fuck town
we lived in deep, recessed country with almost no one around, 10 minutes from hick town and 20 minutes from college town
the country kids all got decent exposure to the college town but chafed against their own upbringing, which led to a lot of really, really weird cultural hangups and confrontations
and also get teen pregnant
before the end of the prologue, which is something like...
18 chapters
the vast majority of the story has nothing to do with zombies
you'll be fine
i mean, it goes by in a flash
don't worry about it, just keep chugging
nice, how are you liking it
you said it *sip\*
funny, i was totally straight edge in high school and then lost my fucking mind in college
GUYS
THE BETA
i think that it's common enough to make few to no friends in school and especially common to basically lose those friends entirely once you graduate
i am absurdly lucky in the sense that i have a small group of friends from high school i still talk to semi-regularly and try to hang with on special occasions
but of the people i befriended in college, there's exactly one i still talk to, and she's my gf
even in graduate school, i made some decent friends but less than 3 months later i speak to none of them
my general experience is that the friends you make online or at work are far more reliable and stick better than friends made in school
same
LOL
i actually went through with that
my master's defense was pretty fun besides being absolutely nervewracking
i had a transparent blowup of dagoth ur in the title slide and i delivered it stark naked
it's also on his actual website
moon while i was an undergrad, i talked often with the faculty both because i found them interesting and because it was good networking
at some point my molecular biology professor told me about invitations from various universities to go take a tour, and that a few of them were paid
virginia tech was one of these, and she recommended i apply for that
i didn't think i would get in so i waited until the last day, but then the very next day they were emailing me like "YES YOU SHOULD COME WE'LL PAY FOR EVERYTHING"
so they flew me out to virginia, i spent the night at a hotel and met with a lot of the faculty and students there
that automatically gives you a huge advantage over applicants who don't tour, because these people recognize you and have made associations with you already
after that i applied to three graduate schools including virginia tech and was accepted there, and the rest is history
oh yeah it's at least once a year that universities do outreach programs
our department always did them in november, possibly also in the spring
oh... right
this is not a good time for visitations
well, that's the point
zombie is _his_ word
that's why it's taboo to say it when it's not actually a zombie
<@!111477124384202752> it was my actual defense, yes, but because of covid-19 i did it from home
yeah this was may
they did, but i told them my webcam was busted
which is true, it didn't work on my laptop
i legitimately tried to make it work
but i was able to do the presentation and the question/answer completely naked
scratching my ass while they asked me what happens to the oxygen levels of the soil when it's saturated with water
yeah, i know andrew, but what are ya gonna do
it's not anywhere as fun as actually doing it in person, but in my book it counts
+pogress
america, qweq
the land of the reckless and the home of the stupid
we have a lot of that nik
people who genuinely hold to "don't tread on me" as a guiding princniple
i think it's fine to be indignant and angry about people who have no problem with endangering others, qweq
i get angry about it too, the more salient question is what can be done about it
that's where i get miffed
yeah, it is
i don't like this
what the fuck
remember guys, no fun allowed
<a:blair:424571787372658708>
every time
EVERY time i go to play higurashi i'm greeted by this fucking face
she mocks me <:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
benis :DDDDD
i hate waking up in the morning
i hate you
oh fuck i never turned off linkybot last night
<:drewlinkaS:404057200622043137>
alright, linkybot is tired
see you later tonight linkybot
lmao, poor nostalgic getting totally ignored by linkybot
go find out
üî®
pokemon stadium had such potential
TRY TO REMEMBER

what the fuck is this
i need to make a science out of increasing the energy in social situations
law number one: talk about a socially contentious topic like murder or slavery
yeah, i'm just sad that the channels are pretty inactive right now
will probably be invigorated with the next update
"drew, it's time to let go, the comic ended four years ago"
i almost used my real name there for some reason
which i think indicates that my very soul is getting tired of homestuck and how poorly it's being treated
where are the results of the census
<:ANGERY:386187563980947476>
i demand numbers
this is the worst day
nice
GREYLINGS
doesn't it just fuck you up that no less than 39 people committed ritualistic suicide for this stuff
what the fuck, how
who is still paying for that server space
Oh No It's Today has my vote
that is... disturbing
neat indeed, but disturbing
how must they feel about having been left behind
fuck yes
my homie roast beef
jim, come get your damn land
so, here's the thing

they thought of this
i aspire to own a web address that is shown on a popular form of media but is not actually owned at point of publication
now TAYNE i can get into
i'm here today to tell you all to go listen to yellow magic orchestra's titular album
it's great fun
i've heard of worse mindsets
i mean
all it took was to massively increase the death count in other ways
yeah, last year there were about 16,000 deaths from gun violence, although that statistic is for ALL gun violence and not just school shootings
in the last four months, 180,000+ people have died from coronavirus or related complications
we did it, patrick, we saved the city
no idea what that is
more like 13 now
also <@!195193018356203520> i had forgotten about that
i like solid state driver a lot too
i just know their self-titled one better cuz i've listened to it more
i'll have to put on SSD next
perfect timing, yellow magic orchestra just ended
the second one has an ominous energy, as if it is sneering at us in contempt of our lowly forms
the first one simply seems sad, punished
i will take it
fat phillip banks
makin is a baby
it was great
you're fucking stupid
speaking of GTPLinky, i gave up on that for now because i'm not smart enough to follow directions when it comes to advanced software
or rather, i'm too lazy to puzzle that shit out anymore
maybe if i were still a teenager i would feel willing to put some time into figuring it out and make GPT2 work, but for now i'm just like "meh, i'm bored by this now, back to vidya"
i'm playing red dead redemption 2 right now
that's as real as it gets my friend
oh, right
that's what i was going to do after higurashi
if you remember i had my list
i got through the rest of the shills list, finished achewood, and am going through higurashi
i forgot what the next thing was on my list, but it's try out iconoclast
then i was going to try deus ex and that other thing again afterwards
<@!153392726832840706> ARTHUR
HAVE YOU LOST ALL OF YOUR FAITH
IN ME
HAVE
_FAITH_
he says as he proceeds to choke a spanish woman for asking for more money
is there any word on whether dutch was developing dementia or if he was just losing his grasp of humanity
yeah, someone who begins a slow slide into abandoning his principles
honestly, RDR2 speaks to me on several levels
i consider it the absolute best narrative i've ever experienced in a video game
people will disagree, some of that based on the fact that it's fairly linear
and yeah, of course, it could have branches
but i prefer a linear narrative, it offered the devs a chance to make a more cohesive plot
i tend to dislike games with multiple endings because writing a really good plot is difficult, and it forces them to come up with multiple conclusions that would all ideally be satisfying
sure, that makes sense tarty
oh
yeah that actually makes a LOT of sense
like, his anger at being questioned stems from him losing faith in _himself_
sure
once upon a time, there was a group of people who wanted to turn a new leaf
they had been caught up on a spell of bad luck, and had struck out trying to find a better place for themselves
eventually, their bad luck began to turn, and they settled on a copse in the middle of the plains, meadows and forests going out as far as the eye could see
they worked hard and made names for themselves, and their neighbors respected them
^
go to bed
no i was literally describing the beginning of red dead redemption 2
play it, it's a fantastic game
then die
Hmmm. HMMM...
Oh-hoh! Hello, friend!
I just cannot for the life of me find a way past this blasted door.
god, now i want to play dark souls again
why do video games have to be so wonderful
actual cannibal shia labeouf?
you know what
here, i'm gonna do a thing
You're walking in the woods,
there's no one around and your phone is dead,
out of the corner of your eye you spot him:
Shia Labeouf.
He's following you, about thirty feet back,
he gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint,
he's gaining on you!
Shia Labeouf!
You're looking for your car but you're all turned around,
He's almost upon you now and you can see there's blood on his face,
my God, there's blood everywhere!
Running for your life from Shia Labeouf!
He's brandishing a knife, it's Shia Labeouf!
Lurking in the shadows,
Hollywood Superstar Shia Labeouf,
Living in the woods, Shia Labeouf!
Killing for sport, Shia Labeouf!
Eating all the bodies,
Actual cannibal Shia Labeouf!
i was going to do the entire fucking thing, but i got bored
now the bot is populated with those phrases, enjoy
NOW YOU'RE ON THE DOORSTEP
god, what a fucking great meme
this is a cultural landmark, people
no, it doesn't
it works by line
i know what my robot half is about
i feel that b3es
i used to do that every semester
lmao no
it was an 1,100 mile journey between home and my university for graduate school
rather adroit, i would say
depends moon, what's like... your goal for the next year
are you staying in the area or moving away
if staying then relax you did fine
yeah you're fine
just keep up the good work
yeah same linkybnot
do not invest your money, the stock market is a giant pile of lies and bullshit
the "beauty of human sexuality" is fine
but i don't want to see a naked woman in public
as much as i like seeing them, it's a complicated space and we have social mores that don't really allow that
have three:



okay
what the fuck
hold on
there's ONE
what the fuck
okay, i see what happened
fucking naming system
i have two more, one second


there we go
do any of those work
i don't know what death grips is besides "music"

happy borth miku hatsune
when will miku hatsune be given AI intelligence and become a consummate sapient being
that will be a really terrifying day
that's right he is
alright five more minutes
get your linkybot in
it is over
that's a serious warning
it's not a ban cuz you were just shitposting/being vague
but still, shilling products is bad mmkay
what do you WANT
WHAT DO YOU WANT ANDREW REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
YOU FUCKING REE
oh my god
did i even download that
i did not
just do it without me, i'm sorry
i've been busy and distracted
i'll start the download right now
it might finish by the time i go to bed
probably later
13 GB? oh yeah, this won't be done until tomorrow
yeah, there is 0% chance i will be ready for this
let's just do it another time
i like the implication that it makes both canada and mexico much, much longer than they actually are and thus enormous
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT THE HELL UP
<@!207991389613457408> their beady little eyes
when they get intense and hostile, it's really fucking creepy
they did a good job with this artowkr
i'm into chapter 8 now and i find myself looking at their eyes a lot to see when their line of questioning shifts
as soon as that little glint of light disappears, a chill runs up my spine
i hate you for quid pro quo'ing this work with me, and yet i enjoy it so much
honestly i'm just curious what part satoko and rika have to play in this
like, satoko has basically done _nothing_ this entire time, she's like nat but with more of a little gremlin complex
rika is more curious as the actual shrine maiden of course
i suspect she has something more to do with all this, seeing as her and the watanagashi are the only parallels with the previous chapter so far
concrete parallels i mean
obviously there are a lot of minor commonalities
yeah basically
all of the actual plot happening aside, i'm really fucking confused as to the fact that this is... hapenning at all?
like, the end of the first chapter was extremely conclusive, it was a pretty unambiguous Ending
fine DMs
<@!195193018356203520> i feel like solid state survivor started off very strongly but ended pretty weakly, which is probably why i forgot it over the self-titled album
the first three tracks or so were like "yeah this is fucking awesome" but i barely realized that the last two tracks were happening before it ended
their titular album is much stronger on average
imo anyway
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
fucking hell
guess i'm awake now
can't describe how upset i am by this
been trying for the last hour
no dice
yeah i've had like 3 horus of sleep
going to try AGAIN but i have no hopes
ugh, god
i've got a head for ten
there's a massive storm rolling through my area and i think it's giving me a migraine
you've got ten seconds to beat it before i add you to the list of HSD casualties
thank goodness fori buprofen
bweeeeeeeeee
what was that, i forget
unless you mean... my friendship
<:peepoHappy:663105514925719556>
oh fuck lmao
i had totally forgotten about that
how's that going btw
nice
nice
oh yeah did i ever tell you i got to 99 smithing finally
some months ago
been wanting to do that for literally 10 years
i've got a gilded cape and everything cuz i did cooking beforehand
yeah same, but runescape interest comes and goes for me
i'll have a few months where i'm fucking obsessed and can't do anything else but then won't want to touch it for ages
i'll probably pick it back up sometime this winter or next year
eventually want to maxstat and do all quests but that'll probably take the next decade
little ol' lady called ramblin' on
but yeah i'm glad i could help you out
what are you even doing to make money
yeah, you have more patience than i do
i think i have late 70s early 80s mining and it's such a fucking grind
i always do motherlode, what's afk mine
oh yeah, sure
bah, i should probably try and get back into it eventually, but i'm finally breaking my streak of just doing old stuff
i've done a lot of new things and experienced new stuff in the last few weeks and i want to keep the ball rolling on that
dero said much the same thing, apparently slayer pays huge amounts of cash if you do it right
what
alright shut up
i'm like four seconds away from banning you for this
i wonder if they'd honor any purchases made in the time it takes for them to fix it
"funniest shit i've ever seen"
you're novel and creative, bitch
hackerman?
areyousureaboutthat.gif
that got me good woc
yeah i don't know about that

```Now Makin, despairing of the return of What Pumpkin, would have banned Kate, but he requested to be allowed to pass on his administration, and in offering a sacrifice drank freely of the fathusky's blood and was demodded. And WHat Pumpkin's staff cursed Makin and resigned, leaving behind few in the wake of their passing; but Hussie fired even the last of the team whom they had left behind. On his return, Drew assumed the mantle of administration, but though he longed to avenge his friend, he bided his time. At that time he traveled with the mods to Cafe-Listhmus and dedicated the server to Homestuck, but afterwards he extorted the Wizard of Chaos to devise how he could punish Altgen. So he retreated to the palace of the Public Call and persuaded his cohorts to make mince meat of the channel's occupants and ban them, promising to deliver great shitposts unto them. So they believed him, made mince meat of the Altgenners and banned them. Lo, and then they were risen up high to greatness and the server was turned to a golden age.```
i was asked to do this, also how is it pathetic
also i cheated, that wasn't from the histories, it was from the library of greek mythology by pseudo apollodorus
here, let me do another one but shorter
nevermind i'll find something later maybe
there are some choice passages from the histories
```Cyrus, convinced that Croesus was a  good man and a favourite of heaven, asked him after he was taken off the pile, "Who it was that had persuaded him to lead an army into his country, and so become his foe rather than  continue his friend?"  to which Croesus made answer as follows: "What I did, oh! king, was to thy advantage and to  my  own  loss.  If there be blame, it rests with the god of the Greeks, who encouraged me to begin the war. No one is so foolish as to prefer  war to peace, in  which, instead of sons  burying their fathers, fathers bury their sons. But the gods willed it so."```
what do you mean
you are a wiener
```"I'll have another one, Jim!"
"No more today Bill. Please escort this gentleman to the door."```
despite dying due to coronavirus weeks ago
it's quite sick
worst nightmare
or actually, a version of this where someone went spelunking and got stunk in a narrow cave in such a way that they literally could not get him out
they found him stuck upside down, so he slowly died as the blood pooled in his head and they couldn't do anything but keep him company
i was going to say, just pump carbon monoxide in at that point, help him go to sleep
horrible horrible way to go

what is that censored word
i am really concerned
B.I.G.
what, is that an element of the mystery
is she a fucking lesbo
it's for old people
that is definitely food for thought
it's not very tasty food but it's food all the same

yes
no, prageru is a """real university"""
i'm ben shapiro, suuuuuper genius!
after our altercation with him i have no doubt this would be called obsessive
but in a way, it's kind of pathetic because he can't even get the company he's partnered with or his own staff to do this
as it usually was in the past, the fandom is picking up the slack

<@!604496853295300676> you're first on the chopping block
üî™
gone.
111.... 1
damn dude
this year has been rough
i do not blame anyone who doesn't like hpmor, for a variety of reasons
of all the shills on the list, it seems to exemplify all the traits in ratfic that people tend to hate the most
arrogant, unrealistic protag, convoluted plot, etc
but for all of that it's still an acceptably enjoyable fic, especially if you're an ardent fan of harry potter in the sense that you would just like to consume more content in that kind of world
tolkien literally invented hobbits and he did it with an incredible amount of grace and style
the rest of the lord of the rings is kind of boilerplate fantasy but he also managed to do THAT with grace and style too, to the point that his notions of how high fantasy works color basically all of english's interpretation of that material
sure, i guess that's what i mean
perhaps it's more accurate to say that lord of the rings is the seinfeld of fantasy
thanks for the reminder, i'll probably let it be
too lazy right now
LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYLA
poop ballsack's been dead for four thousand years
i don't know why, but you know what that reminds me of?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6xbeRaJY90
i think this is the best one compositionally, the dog has a very lovely voice honestly
the scherzo is very impressive though
the original is also excellent https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St7S3YrxqW0
holy fucking shit, that caught me off guard
we need a gif of the shaking for an emote
it screams to be made
i want you all to know that i stared at this discussion for a solid 30 seconds trying to figure out how to respond, and then i gave up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGrbtGmxnI
and of course, the yin to this dog's yang https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dp8Bv--nrA
cody is how i imagine the screams of a dying man must sound
andrew, why the fuck DID you type this
this is rank
hey, if i get yelled at for an unexpectedly disturbing plot synopsis, i think it's only fair you get warned for an unprompted story about vomiting pizza
Shut up!
They hated him for telling the truth.
that just means you deserve six warnings
in fact, why the hell are you telling the same story six times
here's the difference: i'm a mod, so when i do things wrong i get to ignore it because consequences don't apply to me
you idiot, you buffoon
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
oh yeah, that reminds me

<:bait:364818554903855104>
sounds like a personal failing
you really want an incomprehensible map of america? do it by counties

that's probably where earlier colonization happened too
that's around san francisco right
yeah
as a general rule, the establishment of counties became a more regimented, formalized process as the USA became bigger/older
all of the oldest counties are fucking random blobs because no one knew what they were doing for the first 100 years or so
i think that's a population skew map, isn't it
barkley's map is illustrating the difference between population and land area
the USA appears enormously dominated by republican voters until you account for actual people, in which case it becomes far less clear
i think that kind of skew is extremely difficult to read though, because it inherently warps the original area it's supposed to be describing
i like the ones where it's done by blocks instead, with states clearly delineated
that is ibuprofen
i take enough of it that i know what it looks like without question
fucking headaches
that's because you are a disaffected teenager
i look down upon you because i am almost 10 years older
you are SUBHUMAN BECAUSE OF YOUR AGE, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY OTHER DETERMINANT FACTORS
INTELLIGENCE? OUT OF THE QUESTION, WHO CARES
i'm so tired
<a:kermitnod:440188350058594324>
i could tell you, but i'd have to kill you
the only thing i smuggle in my car are my fishing rods
yeah people take that seriously here
i'm not doing any illegal fishing
i buy my permits like an upstanding citizen
i want to commission a nice little simple drawing of the mod team participating in various outdoors activities
then i'm not gonna ask you, now am i
mint do you take commissions
that's pretty cool
well, if you have a lot of free time and want some money, let me know and i'll describe what i'm envisioning
swag money
floppy disk music is a personal weakness, i love the roughness
there's a channel with a metric shit ton of them, although the main ones i really like are the DOOM, What Is Love, and Ghostbusters theme videos
let me grab them

floppotron is extremely talented
in all honesty i actually prefer the floppotron version to the original MIDI
which is really weird
we need more unconventional music
quick post sorting algorithm techno funk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3j9d9BDLa0
still, you can't deny that linkybot is a ticking time bomb
also holy shit this one is great, i hadn't heard it yet but i'm grooving real hard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lq34Ob7Gsg
reminder that portal came out over 9 years ago
portal 1 came out in 2007
portal 1 is older than some people in this server
<:thonkhuh:519063536140550144>
misha, what kind of outdoors activities do you like to do
okay you got me, that made me laugh
i'm thinking more along the lines of... camp, perhaps
ooh, barbecues are great
hiking is also great
ich liebe wandern
anyway, see what i said to mint
i'm a dumb cushy fuck so i love the idea of commissions like this but it's always weird asking what people would think of themselves as doing, y'know?
i just wish i could do something nice for the people i respect without turning it into a huge fucking federal issue
the ones i gave to WP staff
i still don't necessarily regret that, because the spirit in which i gave them was genuine
it's all the stuff afterwards which kind of nullifies it and makes it suck
i feel really bad for mrnostalgic though yeah
it got lost in the shitty foreign mail
i've never sent a package to that country so i don't know if that's typical or not
when i went to the chapel hill pgenpodcast live show
i gave one to kate, aysha, and cro
and then i gave one to mety and meems
honestly, 15 is not a bad estimate for the number of scarves i've made
i gave one to toast, spiral, tera, barry, user5, woc, aysha, cro, kate, meems, mety, rune, a few other people i can't remember
this is just homestuck btw, i've made well over 50 of them as gifts for people in general
i love home crafts
i've never gone skeet shooting
dero brought me to the firing range so i could get used to firing pistols and revolvers, and that was fun
i'd enjoy trying skeet shooting at some point
like, why not
blam blam, shatter
life needs more guns
btw my favorite fleetwood mac song is tusk, don't @ me
i feel it's often underrepresented in their ensemble
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmuBOfurv3o
yes, i know
nothing is set in stone, there's a decent chance it just won't happen
but i've been promising myself i would make a small token of appreciation for the current staff, so i'll say something in mod chat about it
by "make" here i mean "commission"
perhaps andrew, it just depends
you know what
if this server survives long enough, i will make it a tradition to buy mods pizza on their birthdays
how about that
skeet skeet

robot was a fucking incredible stream though
i look forward to watching those movies again next tyear

<:Zoomer:587331355235450897>
claude monet has a lot of influence on local art, i started to realize the other day
the nelson atkins art gallery in kansas city actually has one of his original paintings
not just any of them, but one of the three panels of the water lilies
to top that off, a nearby city has an arboretum that has a full-sized recreation of monet's water garden back in france
it was interesting being there, because it revealed something interesting about his style of painting
most people who look into monet are aware of the anecdote where he got glasses at some point and then after looking through them, threw them on the ground cuz he hated how his cleared vision appeared
but apparently, a huge source of the "fuzziness" was in looking at the water and seeing the reflection as the main object
the faint wavering was how he liked to view the world the most, and i've never been able to see his paintings the same way since
picasso was based in that his art  broke the mold in a very overt, very novel fashion
but he was also a humongous dick apparently
some people think that's based too, just depends on your mindset
i don't know if it's true but there's a story that picasso carried a gun on him and brandished it at people who tried to talk to him about art
i'm sure there's more specific details about it, and i'm not even sure it's true, but still
```Picasso adopted a similar practice, carrying a Browning revolver that was actually once owned by Jarry. Filled with blanks, the gun would be ‚Äúdischarged‚Äù at anyone Picasso found dull, including but not limited to those who questioned the meaning of his paintings or who insulted Paul C√©zanne, his artistic mentor.```
this is apparently real, damn
also the thing about smarter people being worse at interacting with others isn't really true, it's just a matter of hearing about the really terrible stuff over the situations that all go right
in reality, being smart by itself doesn't account for very much, you also have to be fairly professional or charismatic to get far
there's a _lot_ of focus on developing soft skills in science and art in order to make sure you're able to interface with other people and cooperate with them
diarrhea
i feel nothing about the davekat update, but the one before i actually liked
it's also a monthly effect yes
what did cheeze do this time
japanese discs?
i won't believe it's done until they say so
or until they fail to update without saying anything
oh boy
rip discord
why is madden 2021 already available
how the fuck does that work
that's stupid and confusing
GUARDIOES DO CRIVELLA PREFEITURA RIO 1 DOT PNG
i die
how would you feel if that was the last message i ever sent
don't answer
i'm looking at the cover art for Beyond Official album again and thinking about the logic of homestuck 2 just tires me out
i was going to post a whole thing but why bother
homestuck is doomed to fade into irrelevance, less because of the passage of time and more because the people in charge of it were socially and professionally incompetent
remember when the US army rolled out new camo uniforms that had a modern, "digital" effect intended to be more effective than conventional camo, but it actually made them completely visible instead

i was like 9 when they started making these or something, and even i could tell it was a mondo stupid idea
it's called "Universal Camouflage Pattern," it was intended to function in basically every combat environment: urban, forest, desert, etc
the reasoning was that a "perfect" camo would save a lot of money and lives
turns out it didn't function to that effect at all
the pixelized pattern doesn't mesh well with the natural world and actually makes people stick out like a sore thumb
https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/army-camouflage-that-cost-more.html
```The primary issue was an optical effect known as isoluminance. This is when the human eye interprets a number of colors and patterns as a single mass. When this effect takes place in combat zones, it can make it easier to spot soldiers at a distance. The cause of this effect in the new pattern was the sizing of the pixelation.```
```The camouflage also failed to include black in the pattern. This can make camouflage appear flat against 3D surfaces, consequently making it easier to spot those soldiers who were wearing it.```
what in the actual fuck am i looking at
every day is an "oh it's today" kind of day
i'll probably get to go fishing for a little bit though so it can't be too bad
<@!131650004606648320> at some point we should look into that kid from brooklyn online museum
SHUT UP, WESLEY
SHAKA, WHEN THE WALLS FELL
makin, his shills spread far and wide
she's such a bitch to the boys / she acts it up when they call / she's such a bitch to the boys / she plays around with them all
those comics were good
if misha and i hadn't arrived, the fire engings would have been going wee-ooo right now
do you mean fruit like citrus or fruity
njnjnnjini
agreed with all
does this count strictly as harassment
it could be argued that it's just a shitty attempt to present an argument to someone
okay, what exactly happened
this person compiled a list of "things wrong with the comic" and wanted to show it to kate
did he do this in a way that was creepy or stalkerish
<@!164754076293267457> we probably _should_ bring it to modchat but i also don't necessarily feel like it's a huge deal to talk about it in here, there are public users who want to share their opinions on a problem that's already kind of publicized
though i'm not sure if that's because of tipsy or what
agreed
summon them
why not
<@!227181775221161984> be quiet
i don't know if that was a joke but you're not a mod
no
i was referring to the fact that you called them a stalker fuck
yeah nevermind, i regret opening this up in a public forum in any way possible
how did we even get started on this
it's tipsy's fault isn't it
<@!165162590878695424> stop being a fucking wiener
do i need to interrupt this conversation
i mean, i kind of give a fuck
kate openly used her position as a creator for a comic whose primary audience is people beneath the age of majority (yes that is an enormous chunk of readers) to advertise her own nudes to make money
that's fucking moronic even if she was technically allowed to do this
but yes that's kind of tangential to the original problem
yes but the problem is that that has little bearing on the rest of the problem, which is that she routinely harassed members of the fandom who disagreed with her
please try to be more judicious about what you're focusing on
also no, no one deserves to be doxxed
cohen also didn't behave nearly as badly as kate did to my knowledge
they were a fuck up but not on this level
james didn't really do much besides be an asshole on occasion, that aside i don't feel like he deserves to be in this conversation
so what
i mean... yes, but that doesn't justify him being an asshole
god, this is just bizarre
i can't believe how many ridiculous leaps in logic i'm seeing, it's impossible to address them all
it's like a group gish gallop
i do not want james to be dragged into this conversation
in fact i think this conversation has gotten sufficiently derailed to the point that it would be better if we just moved on
that also sounds just kind of... childish? as opposed to criminal slander about people being pedophiles
like, someone can be a fucking moron and post "haha i owned the straights" and it's just kind of embarrassing and pathetic
"this group of people is a den of child abusers" is like... we are in the right to pursue legal action against you for inappropriately painting as criminals
<:professionalism:357916703360811008>

eh
<@!207991389613457408> when i was four dozen eggs i ate five dozen eggs every morning to help me get large, and now that i'm four dozen dozen eggs i eat five dozen dozen eggs so i'm roughly the size of five dozen dozen dozen dozen eggs
whoa
<@!207991389613457408> a new character sprite, this is fucking something
something something goganza
also yes curry woman
IN YOU GO
god i cant wait for fat fuck friday
`THEY'RE POURING LATEX ON HIM`
GOODBYE STRANGER
dang man that's some next level stuff
before you know it you'll have it to the point that you can be taking a bath and just dunk the entire tv in the water with you
a small part of me wonders if i shouldn't have read achewood, because i'll say some stuff and think "that's something roast beef would say, so i probably shouldn't have said it myself"
you know what though, i was thinking of that
i think roast beef is by far my favorite "depressive character" i've ever read
because he'll have those episodes of intense dysfunction where he just cannot do ANYTHING
but then there'll be plenty of moments where he's up and associating with people and doing things, in his own way
no husky, but i'm going to be having a half-pint of maker's mark tonight, so i'll be dipping out of chat later probably
or at least turning myself red as a warning display to the other chat members
yeah woc beef is fucking excellent
for a webcomic it's kind of insane what sort of depth there was to the main cast
also, have i said that my favorite arc was the 3 day fight
pure fucking art, that one
`Our every move is the new tradition.`
i like the idea that the great outdoor fight is a yearly occurrence but there are certain years where it's just so violent that it becomes world famous again
THE ULTIMATE TEST OF MAN!
fuck, that reminds me, i laughed out loud when i got to the comic where lyle purposefully vomits at a football to make it move
that's easily one of my favorites, it's just so unabashedly strange and gross
i spiraled it by the way, that doesn't just happen by not caring
is that from the shrek hand thread
no, it can't be
i remember in that one, he was digging out more space using a fucking metal spoon
in the one carl posted it looks like a bunch of stuff hastily covered with rugs and mats
someone post it
i'm sampling maker's mark mint
i've decided that recoloring myself is a good warning to anyone in the chat that i am INDULGING myself for the evening
yes
andrew, i do not want to hear what color you think this is
o shit
what translation are you doing
i recently read a really, really quality one published by  the penguin company
managed to retain a lot of poetic meter and artistic flair while also being extremely cohesive/readable in english
i have a copy of the odyssey by the same translator that i've been meaning to get to, i think i'll do that after i'm done doing deus ex at some point
<@!207991389613457408> Money Plane.
<@!190973938556207115> ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME?
I'M DARIUS GROUCH III, THE RUMBLE, AND I AM TAKING DOWN THE MONEY PLANE
this seriously isn't purple
this is practically blood red
ah, okay
no, i blew up my name in mspaint and it's clearly not red
i have a difficult time with small text
let me correct this grievous error
that's better
but i'm not drinking wine, i'm drinking whiskey
man, what in the fuck
like, very slightly colorblind i guess
i have barely started to drink, that can't explain why my eyes are seeing this the way it is
i guess i just sick at detecting minute differences in color
here
this won't be red, it'll be the color of the liquor
shut up i'm done talking about it
i was going for copper
someone give me a hex code for copper
i hate you
i am MOVING ON from red you shit
GIVE ME COPPER
thanks shroom
the only valuable member in chat right now
what color do you suggest mint
fuck it we're done
no andrew, and if you do i will end your existence here
bottom right
<:jadeAnnoyed:585545054651678730>
andrew, none of them look EXACTLY the same, especially not the top right and bottom left
the bottom right looked _most similar_
did you ask the same
oh, yes, you did
no, none of them look exactly the same
i can clearly see the difference in these pictures, the bottom one only looks like it has fucking white, ink, red, brown, light blue, and purple
yeah none of those are the exact same
do you derive some kind of perverse pleasure from trying to find people who are colorblind
who are the three
gnawms, who else
husky too? damn
imagine being one of those women who have a fourth cone in their photoreceptors so they can see colors most of us can't even conceive of
do you think that someday we would be able to augment our eyeballs to do this
OH SHIT
no
the only discord server where the owner is the main character is a server with one person
discord servers are otherwise always ensemble casts
soon, woc
soon...
i mean, not really
the nice thing about whiskey is that it actually forces you to take your fucking time, so i physically cannot get smashed
i'm honestly experiencing a very pleasant buzz
i think i'm slowly stockholde syndroming myself into liking the burn on my tongue and throat, too
that is a fucking excellent idea woc
there is no escape
shhh deus ex spoilers
actually i'll just dip out nevermind
THE MAN FROM YOUR DREAMS IS IN THE VIDEO
also holy shit ogre hand thread always makes me laugh
how in the hell is that a real hand, my god
that guy's got some serious fucking jaundice if it's real
i wonder where ogre hand is now
speaking of, when are we doing a mad max marathon
i've never seen the originals and fury road is a masterpiece
THUNDERDOOOOOOOOOME
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEJnMQG9ev8
I WANT THEM _BACK_
dude, i'm fucking adamant that we're doing a mad max marathon someday
the only thing that slightly bothers me about the mad max movies is that
like
max was around pre-apocalypse
he was already a fully fledged adult
and yet in these movies, it looks like society has been broken down for generations
i could live with that mines
<:foolishsamuraiwarrior:280656983982342144>
WHOA-OA
I'M JUST SAYIN'
yeah, it has heart and soul put in it
as opposed to whatever crap they churn out now
they cared so much about their IPs that this was a _commercial_ they made
tell me the last time you saw a commercial with this level of craft in it
fuck, tell me the last time you saw a _cartoon_ with this level of craft and care
BEING THAT YOU'RE MY NEIGHBOR AND I LIKE YA...
dude, these fucking cartoon network promos are GOOD
THEY'RE ACTUALLY _GOOD_
THEY'RE FUNNY
WHAT HAPPENED TO CARTOON NETWORK
i'm just depressed misha, how did cartoon network sink so low
they had style and grace and passion, and now it's CRAP
WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER HEEEEEEEROOOOOOOO
i'm not totally wasted, though i'm quite buzzed at this point
i'm laying down in bed and avoiding chat because i don't want to fuck anything up
it was whiskey actually you fucking pleb
get outta heeeeeeere
it's actually not, whiskey is kind of harsh and you're supposed to drink it very slowly because going too fast is fucking impossible without getting sick
oh shit if you're just trying to be ignorant
then nevermind
the conscious consideration of any animal consists of four things: "EAT SLEEP FUCK HIDE EAT SLEEP FUCK HIDE EAT SLEEP FUCK HIDE"

niklink, what hte actual fuck are you talking about
please link me to this so i can lose my fucking mind
holy shit that video fucking killed me

with every use of linkybot, the chances of your name coming up on the chopping block increase asymptotically
woc that's one of my favorite videos
wildpie101 come back to us pls
find ample meat
only gods can know such beauty
wildpie101 is an emblematic piece of that kind of video editing
it's just so stylistic that whenever you see one of their vids in the wild, you just _know_ it's them from all the little details
also i'm still partial to happy souls myself
same to be honest
i was never fond of trying to fight invaders unless they had a decent sense of honor to it, and even then it just felt like an annoyance
yet, i counted it as part of the experience cuz playing offline is for babies
no qweq, or at least not as like a menu setting
like, you can just disable online play
but if you do, there's nothing you can do online, including visiting friends
which is the main reason i had online play on
ache-wood

i am le tired
oh what the fuck you were already available for the general populace?
get the fuck back in here
wow, completely perfect response
i think that wa--yeah
that's an incredible coincidence

look
i'm not trying to drag down the chat alright
not you nut
or
you know what nevermind
i'm not thinking clearly
fuggedaboudit
go back to shitposting about wieners and linkybot
i have taken the leap, and am now laying fully flat on my back
this will be the real test
if i stop responding after a while, it's probably because i tried to like slightly lean over and twinged my back, and fucking died
last night was very tasteful
tonight is for fun
and well deserved after a hard day's work, if i may say so
i don't even think i've been particularly different from normal all things considered

no tera, please remind me
oh hey that's sweet
<@!168980988477702145> yes absolutely
you should not be playing a randomized anything before actually completing it normally
ah, the roast beef philosophy mines
i am familiar...
wh
tera, just... play through the game
you don't need to 100% it i guess cuz that woul involve all skulltulas and heartpieces
just make sure you beat the game

<@!146014279529791488> are we going fishing today
my fly rod is still supposed to come in
if you're too busy i'm just gonna stay in and play higurashi like a fat piece of nasty trash
we went to a really nice natural spring that's used as a trout hatchery, but most of the time we just fish out of the local city lake
yeah i caught four
dero and i both took one we each caught, cleaned it, and then had it cooked so we could eat it the next morning
with my customary WoC is a Loser hat
which has just become my default fishing hat
yeah man i'm keeping this thing forever
if it starts to fall apart i will find a fucking tailor to repair it
yeah honestly, it's nice
no, unfortunately
also bP it's interesting you should say that, we do something kind of similar
you can bait/scent your hook in different zones, but the one we were fishing in didn't allow that
there's a fly called a maribou jig that's basically a bunch of fine feathers put together, which can be various colors
marabou rather
the white ones look like trout flesh when floating in water, and trout are highly cannibalistic, so they go for that shit often
hey, if it works, why not
i don't eat crab often but i've enjoyed it, if i'm ever fishing on the coast i'll have to try that out
_delightful_
i'm just reminded of southern crawfish parties where they'll take like a fucking truckload of crawdads and boil them, to the point that it sounds like a million tiny screams from the air escaping from their little bodies
eating stuff is fucking horrific if you think about it too much
wait, it's illegal to put someone else's fish on your stringer?
why
they _are_ bugs in a sense
crustaceans are just aquatic arthropods
crabs and lobsters are highly related to insects and arachnids
that message made me feel uncomfy
i basically never fished until after i got back from virginia
i did it very rarely as a kid but it wasn't my thing
now that i'm home, i'm starting to appreciate a lot of the local culture more than before
fishing is a big part of living out here, which is ironic because there's literally no big water bodies nearby,  but people love small lake fishing and stuff like that
crappie, bluegill, small-mouthed bass, etc

i want to go to europe someday to look at the oldest settlements and buildings that we still have to look at
i feel a distinct kinship with the oldest recorded civilizations we're aware of
this but sort of unironically
i dream of visiting the temples in egypt and seeing the ziggurats in old mesoptamia

it's kind of weird to think how formative the super mario movie and tv shows could have been, but they've had relatively little impact on the series from what i can tell
i mean, the super mario movie is fucking batshit of course
the only thing that may have come from the cartoon show though, i think is like
there's a plumber academy and you can see someone there who looks strikingly like wario

<@!205026834205769748> i do, yes, i have copies on each of my computers
in fact, i think it's time to clean up the list
tonight i'm gonna go through and archive the ones we've got up until the last week or so

SO UH, ARE YOU CHINESE OR JAPANESE

this made me think of you guys https://i.redd.it/mdv0peczg5l51.png
he chillin'
what a prick
fuck
i said i would archive the pins tonight
i guess i should do that, fuuuck
i wouldn't be surprised if act 2 just disappears off the face of the earth at some point
i wouldn't trust the people in charge of it to remember they need to work on it
what the fuck, it was excellent
it managed to incorporate EVERY FRIENDSIM CHARACTER in a way that was thoughtful and true to the spirit of their design
it actually developed a cohesive plot for how joey might go through alternia
for that second one alone it's already better than actual hiveswap
the art i guess wasn't that great but it was also 143 pages long, so i'm more than willing to cut the creator some slack based on the sheer amount of work
555-COME-ON-NOW
no cruuk, it's just that it's another indication of how fucked up and nonsensical things are
where i could be so dependable
making good progress on updating the pins archive
i made a logical sense change about how i was doing the videos, since you can upload those directly to imgur
yeah rina of course
no, the bot is helpful for double checking
but i still prefer to do it myself because the bot can go down for whatever reason
yeah but it doesn't mesh well with how i did it already
and it's nice for me to like, physically check each day
it's good to keep track of the health of the server
looking through the pins has been great, reminds me of all the fun times i have here
good times
<a:howSmushing:393934834273353730>
spat will always have been worth it
it's a preserved tableau of a super obscure and niche internet gorup
what's not to love
alright, the pin archive is fully updated, including adding old videos that were previously just stills, and i added two archaic pins that had somehow been left out
<@!205026834205769748> just for safety's sake i've also downloaded the entire archive to an external USB drive that i'm keeping in a safe location, as well as having a copy on both my laptop and desktop computers
even if imgur somehow goes down, we're solid
AND and i downloaded a zip directly from imager that should have all of the post data included, i think, so that information like the exact message and stuff will still be recorded
here at HSD industries, we take data archival extremely seriously
i mean
i do try to back up server history in general, too, that's what SPAT is
but each discord channel only has room for 50 pins
we've been around for a while so we ran out of space years ago
i took it upon myself to start making an external archive so we don't have to just get rid of that shit
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE _I AM_
fuck, i need to get back to playing hig
higurashi
<@!207991389613457408> we've got a live one
ever17, as much as i hate it, is an example of a VN that uses its medium to proper effect
it mostly involves the ability to tell and retell a narrative that kind of looks similar from different angles but then when you take a step back, you realize there are actually significant differences
another example would be the aradia route in pesterquest, which i actually loved for utilizing the medium effectively: it employed the ability to choose how the discussion unfolds and made the chapter proceed based on that
it's a small thing but it's pretty typical for VNs to apply that where it would be awkward in a conventional story
VNs also occupy a really weird space where they're sort of kind of video games but largely not really
that's hotly debated though
meep
misha i find it extremely weird that ||curry woman got a sprite but has only appeared in it once so far||

how can i help you
good job
proud of you
i'm amazed at how blatant a ripoff most of this game is from breath of the wild, but then i'm doubly impressed at how much batshit nonsense they've also added to it? https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307550/Craftopia/
honestly despite the flagrant copyright violations this game actually looks... kind of fun? there's a part of the trailer where there's conveyor belts pushing dozens of cows into a flaming pit for food production
and the exploration looks pretty fun, especially considering it's multiplayer
did you get to the part with the hang gliders yet
the animation is almost 1 to 1 with breath of the wild
also most of the attack animations and the character models


i mean, putnam has a point in that i specifically said copyright violations, but i was being kind of flippant about that
this is absolutely ripping off one or both games
probably monster hunter a bit too
and pokemon
yeah
like i said, i'm kind of impressed at how much of this is overtly ripped off, and yet it still manages to look kind of fun
if it was more like 5 or even 10 bucks i would probably pick it up just to see what's going on
20 is too much though
i'll put it on my wishlist in case it goes on heavy sale
you know what else you should steal?
<:robotass:737043838761304084>
you just really want to play fall guys don't you
the fuck is cube world
oh no
no no no i remember this
or maybe i just played something _like_ this
whatever it is, those memories are awful
what did he mean by this
i think what mines is saying is that being a ripoff is not inherently bad
but, there can certainly be bad vs good ripoffs
you can look at a flappybird ripoff and say "yeah that ripoff really sucks" or "wow they were really good at ripping that game off, or even added new stuff to it!"
i would argue that being a ripoff does automatically open something up to more criticism, but it depends on how plain and obvious the ripoffedness is
i don't think that any game based on a fantasy concept with elements like elves and dwarves is a ripoff of lord of the rings
but i think that a game with a plot where you drop a magic ring into a volcano would be kind of hokey and i would judge it accordingly
like i said, it depends on how blatant it is
someone can remake ocarina of time and make it even better than the original, but i'm going to deduct points for opting to just remake something wholesale
it depends
let's look at yooka laylee for an example
yooka laylee is not a great game
but its bad qualities are not because it has the same sort of progression and gameplay
its bad qualities are because it didn't quite know how to get that style down right
its story would have been bad if it was blatantly too much like banjo kazooie but claimed not to be
like if you still had a bear and bird protagonist
no mines i'm not explaining myself right, sorry
it does have bad gameplay, in a roundabout sense; it doesn't feel tight
but that doesn't make it a bad _ripoff_ that just makes it a bad 3D platformer
i'm trying to illustrate what an inherently bad ripoff would be
which is if yooka laylee was about a bear and bird who had to save yooka's sister jessica from a witch who wanted to steal her youth or some shit
there's a level of parallelism that becomes impossible to ignore
and i would argue that's a threshold for judging a ripoff as being blatant and inherently bad
<@!155401695138938881> are you tay
<:jaedThinking:265894870214901761>
i've directly asked tay if they want to be called mines or tay and they said it doesn't matter
at least i think i remember that
yeah see
i agree that ripoffs are valid as long as they're suitably aware of their ripped off status and aren't totally shameless about it
are all of those things sufficiently different from each other
because i would say yes
now imagine that in fallout, instead of emerging from an underground bunker in each game, you're someone from the pre-apocalypse who roams the wasteland in a junker and one of the main plot elements is about how people war with each other for gasoline
would that still be sufficiently different from mad max? no, it wouldn't be, it would be a blatant shitty ripoff
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
okay, i revise my stance: if it's a blatant and shitty ripoff but it's _funny_ because of that, it's okay
<:waitwhat:316648744579760128>
really? i didn't get that impression from 3D world at all
i felt like galaxy was designed more or less consistently
i mean, it has a variety of different kinds of levels, but every 3D mario does
the exploration is part of its themeing, you're exploring "the galaxy" and seeing all of these strange worlds even if it's a linear experience
tone of exploration =/= exploration game
even if you're on a railroad, if something is a new experience for you you're technically exploring it
interestingly, i kind of hate galaxy 2 for some reason
it's not bad, i just felt like it added nothing and the main hub sucked
i felt like the way the hub worked in galaxy 1 was WAY better
and that it also felt more like a proper space/planet themed 3D mario game
i don't know i was just really disappointed in it
what in the fuck are you TALKING ABOUT
the entire game is planetoids
that's all it is
it's not "completely different" it's just more linearly designed
the more i think about it, the more i feel like putnam has a point
the difference is that i don't feel like mario galaxy being designed with linear tracks is a bad thing because it's fucking fun
also hot take i feel like odyssey was extremely well polished but not actually all that fun
3D land is the same as odyssey in that vein, it's a well designed game but it gives me no reason to want to revisit it
i beat it and it was over and i felt nothing
hm
no, it doesn't
it's not the hub
it's the fact that each level is a place you can openly explore without (many) restrictions
whereas galaxy is much more guided
you can't deviate from a set path, you just have to clear obstacles
i mean there's a little exploration possible but it's not obvious and only in certain areas
mario 64 and sunshine both have a hub world you can fully explore, AND each individual level has it so you can get multiple different shines in any scenario
agreed
yes, in galaxy each map has multiple discreet locations
took them long enough
also misha it's certainly the most polished but it does nothing for me
i don't know why but i've been distinctly uninterested in revisiting it
<@!207991389613457408> going through chapter 4 now and like, ||coach looking at satoko like "doesn't it make your soul feel cleansed to see satoko smile?" and i immediately thought, "that's secretly her dad back from the dead or something." then he goes "when she gets older i want to marry her." NEVERMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIND||
I KNOW
lol
funny you should say that
because i started back in fucking march or something
i just now started to get into it more
PUNISHED MIYAMOTO
you know what i want to see? sonic 06 but the dev team actually gets to finish making the game
i agree, trunks is actually like a really competent character
because he, y'know actually kind of cares about what's going on and he understands the stakes involved
lmao
he even kind of sounds like trunks
voicewise
shadow the hedgehog is fucking hilarious on the surface
it is so unbelievably edgy as an entry in the sonic franchise
i mean, dr. ivo "eggman" robotnik claims sonic is "the ultimate lifeform" at some point doesn't he
send me a few of those would you
I'M SODA RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK

those arms are so uncomfortable to look at, i almost want you to delete it for that and not the ass
<:POGGERS:408627094277455884>
i'll have to actually properly watch face the music but i'm surprised the reception is so good to it
and pleased
well, it's like
a spot of brightness in a time where everything sucks
you have to admire the film and everyone involved for trying their hardest to bring joy to people
that too, yeah
i think that's a weird question
having played one of each kind of instrument, they're all complex and difficult to do in their own ways
i've done brass, woodwind, piano, and a little bit of percussion
oh, and strings
i'm not done
woodwinds and brass were of similar difficulty because they required control of embouchure as well as the use of both hands
percussion required tight control of rhythm obviously but was easier to concentrate on because you were only using your two hands
piano felt the most complex because it required both of your hands AND tight precision from both of them for more complicated pieces
cello was something else entirely, using both hands but in profoundly different ways
i hated playing trumpet, my mouth is too fat for it
couldn't get the right embouchure without lots of practice
my favorite brass instrument was the trombone, but the baritone was basically the same with valves and they both were fun to play
i played the cello in middle school and i loved the tonal range on it
woodwinds were always the weirdest to me, i don't have much experience on them compared to brass and piano
but i tried clarinet, saxophone, and briefly the flute..
i could barely get a note out of the flute
i don't know why but i just sucked at it
anyway, i played piano for over a decade starting at a really young age and got probably the farthest with that and trombone, piano is fucking _hard_ and requires lots of practice because unless you're in an ensemble or a symphony you're carrying an entire piece by yourself
but the object lesson here is that they're all different so stop being pedantic wieners
add an inch to that height and then we'll talk
pianos are way more expensive and harder to play around with people
do the guitar instead
piano and guitar musical theory are pretty different from each other, kind of
man, it's been years, nevermind, i don't know shit
music was so fun
"your ass is grass, honey."
learning chord progression was how i started doing basic piano
i've never played guitar but i assume that tabs are kind of like that too, in the sense that they're fundamentally important for playing a lot of guitar music?
dero has played guitar for something like 15 years, she would know way more than i do
music is complicated
i need to get the band back together
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
upright bass tabs
yeah, with classical stringed instruments, frets are for fuckin noobs and cheaters who can't feel the notes by memory
ah, yeah, that's different from how dero did it
she learned from like a classic rock/country guitarist who made heavy use of chords, though of course there were lessons with single note melodies in there too since she'd play duets with him
playing whatever shit is perfectly valid for learning, it's just a different musical context
i can't imagine playing without some kind of notation honestly
i mean, maybe if i tried picking up a guitar and really going hard on it, but otherwise no
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
you know, i imagine this is way more of a thing with guitars specifically because i think they're more versatile than most instruments
they have a very wide range to play off of and can form harmonies with just a single instrument
the only other thing that readily comes to mind that can do that is piano
but guitars are way more affordable and most importantly portable
i imagine that has something to do with their diversification
b3es it's a very interesting topic
music is cool shit
heads
you kind of can't, that's the thing
more classical string instruments don't have the tonal range or nearly the ability to self-harmonize as a guitar
you can get like two, MAYBE three strings
but not all four
but yeah, with guitars it's not just easier, it's basically expected
makes sense to me that tabs would be such a common way to play it based on that
yeah
i mean, music theory is very formalized
it's hard to learn to read sheet music on your own
hell, i had been doing it since i was five and by the time i stopped playing music i still couldn't sight read that well or look at a given line/space on the bars and say "that's x note"
then, i was never extremely serious about it, i was lazy as fuck
that's true in the treble cleff
yeah
it's different with bass clef
<:ree:475542526791516170>
fine, you win
yeah, i'm extremely unfamiliar with anything besides treble and bass clef
i guess the point misha is going for is that christianity isn't a monolith, so saying that "aslan is a jesus allegory" is simplifying the matter
like, yes, there are a ton of parallels, but which jesus is it

the problem is that americans are prudes and especially nosy
jesus fucking christ
i'm at a critical point in higurashi so when i looked over and saw that picture it spooked the fuck out of me
like actually made me jump a little bit
git ne giid
got me good rather*
also gnawms shut up already
it's a good story
i'm literally reading it right now and enjoying the shit out of myself
no, i'm near the end of chapter 3
no
i think the spark for DOS2 has well passed for now
try another time
i'm busy
and you are a fool
<:foooooooooool:292673270199746561>
the fuck
yes.
this is kind of like how harry potter the books versus harry potter the movies shaped up
in the books, voldemort just dies
like he gets hit by his rebound curse and then slumps over like any other corpse
there's a physical body there to demonstrate the proof that even the dark master, the most evil and cruel wizard of the modern world, is still mortal like anyone else
despite all of his attempts to be otherwise
in the movies he turns into burning shreds of paper and floats away, which is also symbolic in a way but far less powerful
there's real strength in imagery where you see the corpse of an enemy, especially if that enemy is powerful beyond reckoning
seeing lord english's body would serve as an underscore to his arc that makes all of the attempts to get rid of him worthwhile
also in simpler terms, having literally your primary antagonist get killed off screen with no other treatment is fucking lazy and cheap
yes interro, and that was fucking metal
uh
tm i'm not sure that's right
granted it's been a while since i've read
but i'm pretty sure that the whole deal is that caliborn kills his denizen -> he breaks his god tier clock and obtains the floating house symbol -> the kids come in for a fight and he uses it on four of them
i mean, wasn't a whole part of the story trying to find a way to make him killable
stories with divine intervention and meddling can still be interesting if told the right way
but it doesn't help when the author throws away most of the rest of the story for it
sure that too
something that might have helped would have been keeping bec noir relevant and somehow getting him on the side of the kids, or at least mutually against LE
something that's pretty typical in scenarios like this and can be very fun/clever when done right
but no, that didn't happen because hussie either forgot, stopped caring, or deliberately wanted to "subvert expectations" even though it wouldn't be satisfying
hell, you know what, i'm sure there IS a way to make subverting that story development interesting, but this wasn't how to do it
HUUUUH NO
sit down, SIT DOWN
NO _NO_ ***NOOOOOOOO***
<@!191265659936702464> i definitely want to do fall guys at some point but i suspect msot people don't have it
alternatively, i think nat has convinced me that among us looks fun
the games are quick and snappy and it doesn't seem overly complicated
also a quarter of the price of fall guys
it;s one of his cousins
so this is about certain kpop bands getting an absolutely monstrous amount of likes/mentions on twitter through botting, right
that's cool, that's a good thing to write on
ah
does it also mention how there's been a huge string of sex trafficking scandals
fair enough
i'm only tangentially aware of kpop stuff
andalusia what is u doin
i don't go to parties, problem solved
why would i be going to parties i'm not in college anymore
britney spears is a victim of an exceptionally abusive father yes
she's been trying to gain sovereignty for decades and never been able to get outside the grasp of her father
who is basically siphoning cash from her career
i think attention might be getting thrown back onto that ordeal now but i'm not sure, either way it's extremely sad
if you're a good social engineer definitely
moneyp lane.
moneyplane honestly does not seem like a fun movie
we can watch it as an exercise in frustration
yeah makin is right, you can be the change you want to see in the world
plus a go pro would be good in case another asshole comes by like that one who might have been shooting at you, and driving that fucking pontoon around the lake
thank god that guy got arrested
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
yeah, i'm jealous cuz i haven't been able to join in for about a week
i'm waiting for my fly rod to come in but trump fucked up the postal system so it's undergoing interminable delays
what's austin doing now
austin's the guy in charge of vast error, arguably one of the most well known/successful fanventures
and thus the center of a lot of weird drama
and good music
and decent-ish use of flash
lmao
just casually inserted in the middle of everything: `he beats me.`
i prefer dogs
that's the better answer
pets are obnoxious and dirty
wow! wow...
good ol' beeger
beeger's a love bug, what are you talking about
i wish i had the other one too
the classic blunder
let me see if i can finally get a picture of mocha
i've spent a lot of time on trust building

Good girl
<:HotDog:244819486392188930>
THIS
:devito:
is ART
i think most if not all kpop requires talent, it's more a question of like... aesthetic
the requirements to become a kpop star are kind of insane, and anyone who reaches that kind of status can be said to be pretty good at what they do
so at that poin it's just a matter of saying "which group do i like best and why"
TRASH
DERIVATIVE
the only kpop group i know anything about is b1a4 because that's my gf's favorite
and then the only other things i concretely known about kpop are "rap monster" and that one song about being a shrimp or sushi or some shit
le monke
it's part of the standard package
you become a libertarian and they install this thing in your head that allows you to determine completely inaccurate things with complete certainty
no, because you're self aware
it sounds pretty interesting to me at least
i love weird shit
speaking of games we should play together look at among us
it's like ss13 on crack but without the insane learning curve or skill ceiling
at least mint is on our side
nat and i want to play it with a bunch of peeps from here, i'm trying to get people together
and i guess whoever we don't get to fill the 10 people cap, we can just dredge randos for
always better with people you know though
i watched nat play it for a while, it seems fun
it'd be sweet to get all 10 people from here so we can scream at each other but having 5 or more works just as much i imagine
swag
that's like six, seven? cool stuff
me as well, never played it before
gotta up that lie stat
"where were you?" "i dunno lol i was trying to figure out what this doohickey is"
no, i mean
you're completely right it's ss13 lite
that's kind of the appeal, in the sense that most people don't have the patience for ss13
among us looks far less complicated and the rounds go faster, which makes sense to me
sure, somethin' like that
to be fair, i would also rather be playing ss13 with some dedicated people
guro is as inherently horny as furry, which is to say that it's a contentious topic that people tend to disagree on a lot
i guess that's my thing with guro/furry/whatever, is that there are two solid camps where one side claims it's for horny and the other side claims it's not
but both camps will argue that it's never used for the other thing
i've seen that debate go down endless times and it's kind of tiresome
"i've NEVER seen guro used for non-horny" "well guro inherently doesn't refer to horniness it's an art form"
first the stone shaping industries, then...
i had personally never noticed
it's so nonchalant too
what did they mean by this
yes
also i've been wondering this since day 1, why is the C the only letter that's red
SWING YOUR AAAAARMS
FROM SIDE TO SIDE
COME ON GOOH GAH IS THE DARIO
it's--oh, it's actually 5 PM now so now would be the time i guess
i don't know if i feel like it tonight
then again, it's been an extremely tough day of work
you know what, i think i'll bust out this 2004 pinot grigio while i cook dinner
yeah vR
what will your poison be tonight if you decide to join, mint
i'm still not that knowledgeable about wine besides "i like the sweeter varieties"
the first wine i ever had was this ultra dry white wine that made me want to vomit
i think i mentioned before but after helping a family move last week they gifted me five bottles of older stuff from 2004-2010
i busted open one of them last night and it was still good, pleasantly surprised
i was under the impression that most wines were undrinkable past like 1 or 2 years but apparently these are all fairly good quality, so they've lasted thus far
the one i sampled last night was something called a riesling mosel
fine wine does, yes

i don't usually drink fine wine
depending on the type, it seems that most varieties will expire between 1 to 20 years
particularly good vintages can last for a long time though
i have no idea reti i'm not a fucking sommelier
i'm just dabbling in something that's too rich for my blood
you know what kind of wine i usually get? barefoot rose, which is cheap but tastes fine
i don't know SHIT
SO GET OFF MY BACK
YOU ARE NOT MY MOTHER
man, i always feel really weird quoting that particular line from fesh pince because anyone not familiar with it is going to think i'm just incredibly edgy
>stinky
incoming woc brappost
would you please sit down
tensei what in the fuck is your avatar
the blue meat is throwing me for a loop
that makes sense
you'd be better off watching this: <:robotass:737043838761304084>
shitpost in lit, you're gonna get hit
unless it's one of the countless times where we just look the other way
yes
i see the logic too but it's like claiming that incest is fine as long as the goal is not to create a baby
that might be right from a certain perspective but there are such powerful social taboos surrounding the idea that it's just not worth exploring
ez breezy
there are laws regarding proper disposal of dead bodies but no one "owns" them, that would be strange
at most there are people in charge of taking care of them
immediate family or whoever determines burial/whatever, professionals take care of actual handling
probably laws against that
yeah i assume there are laws against defiling dead bodies
same as there are laws against graverobbing
this part of the ~~video~~ conversation is really weird
wow, we're still on this?
i mean
the benefit of necrophilia is a personal one, the benefit of science is generalized
that's right tipsy, we're talking about _this_
this is what we've been reduced to
i'm not sure if it's strictly needed but do so anyway, let's pour another bit of gasoline on this fire
we need more nurses and doctors, i agree with the assessment
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
how is it a dumb argument
people can and have been sued for less trivial things than fucking a relative's corpse
not boring, i'm fascinated
treating human and animal bodies as equivalent, _especially_ in a medical context, is a horrible and stupid idea
that reminds me archie, we used to have a skeleton of an asian man from the 1970s that i used to play with during highschool anatomy classes
it was very short
usually when you get a skeleton or other anatomical parts they're labeled so you know where they came from
otherwise it's called the black market
okay, i'm not aware of this reference
please explain
that's pretty wild
oh my god <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that's the worst part
ever since learning that getting your body cremated only costs about 30,000 or so i've been planning to set aside money for that
i thought it was something only rich people could do but that's vaguely acceptable
er
not cremated
cryostasis
opposite things
just fucking burn my body up fam
but no getting your body put on ice indefinitely is apparently cheap
30,000 is nothing compared to the eventual possibility of being resuscitated
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
what have i got to lose besides money i won't be using anymore
lat it's way more complicated than that
god, i've had nightmares the last two days now that you guys mention it
a couple days ago we were having a gentle thunderstorm, which usually i really like
i woke up briefly and went back to sleep, then i started dreaming about grimdark rose chasing me
she cornered me and right when she was about to choke me to death, an enormous thunderclap shook me awake and i actually felt scared for my life for a second
the second one was higurashi related so who cares
oh no
makin's just seething because he doesn't experience dreams
he goes to sleep each night and enters the void
then he emerges each morning in a cold sweat, with no knowledge of what happened betwixt
that's why he's so scared of death, because that's what it's like
homestuck not being terrible?
fuck you're right
sometimes they're not boring, especially to the person experiencing them
i've had some dreams that hold enormous personal significance, either through weird mystery or through the sheer amount of terror i experienced with it
that sucks
i've toyed with the idea of switching to a dymaxion sleep cycle
of course, it's fucking hell to actually try and pull off
it's weird to think they're a real phenomenon
alright, a few more minutes
mint does indeed jam
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
i know i say that we need more original ideas and not sequels or reboots, but when is the college days sequel of ed edd n eddy coming
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
disney, smh
<:WutFace:459126920349483029>
to be fair, that's at least based on something
the "boat parade" where numerous boats belonging to trump supporters got sunk in the wake caused by the parade
i didn't know it was photoshopped though that's dumb
that all being said, i want to comment on this post really fast
to me, this is like the essence of a good 4chan greentext
not too long, image sticks out in your mind, decent conclusion, looking back at the image a second image confers new meaning
that's like the express purpose of reaction images is to give life to your post and it fucking kills me when they're used properly
i miss that aspect of 4chan
oh happy birthday carl
i _guess_ we could let you react to stuff again, for today only
let me think about it
how old are you now, like 638?
"1170"
"weeks"
that'd be 22.5, not a bad guess tbh
anyway, i've decided to grant your request
it is liable to be removed at any point you fuck up too hard though, so tread lightly birthday boy
it is done
snatched my weave, sis
welcome to being low leveled
the greatest hindrance to fun in the early stages of a character
yeah...
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
tipsy calling us shady
there's no way we can be shadier than [insert politically divisive geographical area here]
what the fuck
is it wrong that part of me wants to go to brazil solely based on the fact that i have been recommended brazilian bbq
i want that fucking BEEF
what kind of vistas are we talking
i mean, brazil is no fucking tiny country
it has a huge area
waterfalls are pretty good, yeah
i think my favorite places i've ever been for the view are the redwood forests of the sierra mountains and then the rolling hills of wyoming
i haven't been to wyoming in over 10 years and i can still see those hills in my mind like it was yesterday, with the rocky mountains in the background
a beautiful place
gonna have to go back there someday
yeah alaska is fucking enormous
wait
yeah no hold on
alaska is only 663,000mi^2 not fucking 7 or 8
i hate you

alaska IS bigger than texas, the next biggest state, by about three times
but yeah that's wyoming right there
absolutely beautiful country land
missouri just completely flat except for the ozarks, which are beautiful in their own right
<:blobstare:606480150401515530>
i need to use it more, it's good
the shit with phantos is bad but does not deserve public attention
i suggest we move on
also IS gitaxian 30+?
i always thought git was my age or younger
gitaxian: i am bab
yeah
i mean, it's also a question of shitty things historical or contemporary
i think most people have at least one thing they've fucked up pretty bad in the past, it's more a question of how they behave in the present
i like to think that, anyway, as someone who has had many a fuck up when they were younger
all of the things i would consider actual skeletons are not entertaining, they're just depressing and i suffer extreme anxiety trying to make up for them
i can offer amusing anecdotes that are less skeletons and just massive boners
for instance: one time in my freshman year of high school, we went to go perform at a jazz concert at a nearby university, and at some point i got separated from the rest of the band
i didn't think much of this for some reason and just went to go hang in the bowling alley
i didn't own a cellphone and just spent my money on a round of bowling instead of calling a relative on the payphone (they still had payphones back then)
after about an hour i was like "maybe i shold tell someone i'm gone"
called my folks and they were fucking screaming at me saying that the school had been searching for my ass all afternoon
my grandfather came to pick me up, they cancelled a trip to a fundraiser to look for me, and i got grounded for three months
i trust most people here fairly well, but i would absolutely never air the more seriously damning details of my personal history in a public context simply because there's always going to be someone looking to weaponize it somehow
that's the sort of thing you just keep to yourself unless you find yourself in a private context where it'll be immediately helpful in some fashion
<@!421368799875301378> didn't mean to ignore you, i played the trombone for the most part
but there was a bunch of other stuff besides, main things i enjoyed were piano and cello
i don't want to think of the person that i was before college and even then i had a lot of work to do
i don't think i got to the point where i felt decently conscientious of others until like... 2017
it's not like i wanted to be a shitty person or purposefully ignored others, i actually have always wanted to be "good"
but i just was really shitty at it and didn't really know what that meant sometimes
kind of same mines
i don't think i achieved any kind of substantial self-awareness until high school and then it took me until college to really start assessing myself actively
i wonder to what extent this sort of thing is normal for people
like, how many people go through these defining moments where they really, truly fuck something up hard and that's how they get better
as opposed to learning about it before doing something wrong
bojack horseman
yeah it ended earlier this year
the conclusion was pretty decent
just watch it
the funeral episode with ||his mom?||
i like the funeral episode, although i can easily understand people seeing it as self-indulgent and not very entertaining
there's that one moment though where he's going through the monologue and describing ||his mom dancing with his dad one time and it being a genuinely happy memory, and it plays the scene in front of his eyes as we see silhouettes on the background|| and that scene always send chills running up my spine
thankfully i don't talk to people irl so i don't have to deal with that shit
9/11 was a pretty traumatic event but like any other nationally important event it's been thumped about long past its due
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
nah it's just thinking about how i've been an absolute shitstain in the past
i've promised myself i'm going to try and forgive myself and just try harder at being good in the now, and i think it's working a bit lately
that's all we can do
what is this
that's quitter talk
lmao
bam, what a HELL of a shill to start on
tdbc is an insane departure from not only the quality but style of everything else
no the writing is also shite, it's just funny if you look at it from a certain perspective
<@!213413608732884994> have this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2p9c605N0I
also no andrew what is it
they do though
orange pill guy or whoever is known as william
the names don't get used much because the story is only 6000 words long
is it really?
im sure you've heard worse excuses than that
about stuff in general
it's not that they can't, i just don't think it's necessary
there's only so many times you need to refer to a character by name
i had no problem with the way pills treated character references
i think that's a you problem
i went back and read pills like a week ago and it was completely readable
strong man
those are his feet
SEND HIM TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, I WANT HIM EXPELLED
imagine being this upset at not getting to be racist anymore
from the wtc chat i think, but yes
i don't ever talk on the wtc discord so i'm not in there
my own fic??
how dare u malign my work
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
at no point did i ever intend for spat to become the equivalent of a diary but i guess that was the logical conclusion
no you're just a dummy
gross
yeah, like i said
i think this is lat being dumb again
and making abjectly wrong arguments
poopus removus*
Ron;s Ron shirt was almost as bad as Ron himself.
i think a lot of contemporary pushback on harry potter is just because it was so mindblowingly popular 15-20 years ago
mmmmm generally yeah, i agree
there are definitely some people who are intentionally malicious
truscum -> transmedicalist -> bioessentialist
which still baffles me that trans discourse has like
accelerated so quickly
yeah harpy it's fucking exhausting
i don't have a need to worry about it and little backing to understand it, and from how intense and hateful people get about it with each other i kind of don't want to interface with it at all
i have few strong opinions about the subject i just want to be generally supportive
lat that hasn't been my experience
i mean, thankfully the trans people here are extremely reasonable and understand that it's not possible for every human being to understand every social issue
but i've met some trans people from other internet circles who get pissed off at people who don't take every effort to inform themselves, and get EXTRA pissed off if you don't come to the same conclusions as them once you've done so
i don't talk to those people anymore
shit, _i_ don't know what the deal is with he/him lesbians
t-try the short one
alright sure lat that seems obvious enough
i'm going to ask for no more details and let it be that simple in my mind unless it becomes directly relevant
lat... yes they did
you ever hear about MAPs
lat the overall point is that regardless of its origins or spread, there are real, actual pedophiles who attempted to barge into LGBT space and claim sanctuary
i'm fucking dead man
yeah cy
i make no secret of my lack of knowledge about this stuff
i think that people who are really into social issues tend to forget that like 90-95% of other people are not
and know basically nothing about them
consume my hindquarters
yeah tensei
it literally made me read all of achewood and now a bunch of us post robotass occasionally
is just how it is
ah, fresh bait early in the morning
it's been a while
technically right, the best kind of right to be
"n64 games are trash they're too old"
lat is baiting or else i die
banjo kazooie is a really iconic 3D platformer released by rare before they left nintendo
it's just extremely well-loved by people who grew up in that time period, it's one of my favorite games
the sequel was also really good
but then rare left nintendo and banjo kazooie entered serious development hell, then got a game for the xbox 360 that was basically a completely different genre, and no one was ever happy again
friendly reminder that this all happened over 10 years ago: banjo kazooie nuts and bolts was released in 2008
floppety floppety
YCH?
it's important to remember that stuff like this worked out more or less okay for all of human history, and we didn't have shit like the internet until the last 30
yeah house phones still exist
i have a fucking house phone
that's terrible
they're very practical
what if you lose cell phone service
i don't think lat literally means "forgets that her children exist at all and need to be reminded that they're physical entities"
pretty sure it's more like
"forget your children are in a certain location"
"forget that your children haven't been fed today"
stuff like that
yeah but a lot of people are bad at being parents and most people don't want to talk about that
i'm not saying it's good, that's just how it is
kids really sholdn't be allowed unfettered access to the internet at all times
it leads to poor socialization
my young cousin is like a posterchild for not letting children use the internet whenever they want
he is morbidly obese, unintelligent, lazy, and has no friends
it's really fucking sad
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
lat you're really prone to extending your own circumstances to basically everyone
i mean, i guess we all do that to an extent, but you in particular do it every single day
i have also benefitted from the internet but i don't think that's the rule
it's an extremely complicated topic with lots of factors involved
there is just as much about the internet that can hurt someone as can help them
just look at incel mentality
people being exposed to ideas that validate their worse impulses and reinforce them
but there's also places like this community where we can get together from across the world and discuss these problems and become more informed
it's kind of a mixed bag really
this is what we mean when we say children below a certain age shouldn't be allowed unfettered access to the internet
children often lack the experience or facultative reasoning to understand when they're being taken advantage of or misled
i have a solution to that tipsy: i'm probably not having children
like, really, fuck that
i mean, even if i was in a spot where i could reliably provide for another human being, the state of the world makes me perpetually upset and sometimes i genuinely believe it's immoral to bring more people into the world with the way it's going
that's not an entirely rational thought but still
that's why i inherited the server: your own cynicism was your downfall
get owned, by me
i want to talk about star wars tomorrow
STAR WAAAAAAAAAAARS but really.
i just saw a clip of fallen order where the force is used but accompanied with the nice stuff: personal and philosophical reflection
the use of the force as it relates to the motives and beliefs of the user
another thing to add to my list: star wars extended universe material
nah it was a really good video game
later today i guess
stfu i'm tired and was just thinking lazily about it
i really, really like the force is all
i might if discussion gets super intense like it did last time
but for now no
<:doit:306255735929438223>
it's more that star wars posting got so bad at one point that it turned into a meme, and banning discussion of it turned into a meme
we have a hidden channel called <#665584191211307018> where, if we D--> execute order 66 then it'll banish anyone there if they use star wars related terms
yeah it's late here too, i need at least some sleep
besides tensei latched onto that topic for bait REAL quick
nat i have no control over my life
i am an abject failure
i hope that shows up in linkybot
NICE
shut up stinky
i don't know why i told you to shut up, i'm tired, sorry
i'm going to bed before i start picking fights for fun
ü§º
this emote will never not make me think of nights tbh
i'm sure you could go back and find a use of it in this channel at some point and then take it from there
the return
lmao, she's just so small
anyway, your streams were on fucking wednesdays, fridays, saturdays, AND sundays for several months in a row
misha might have hastened it but people were already getting well and truly sick of your shit
alright i guess that debate is over
if stream fatigue is a meme then misha streaming his stuff has nothing to do with makin's audience falling away
for the dank color
isn't that betraying the people's trust?
i mean, i'm hesitant to accept the reasoning of why anything is bad based on arguments by people who didn't even watch the stuff
it's perfectly valid to say "i wasn't interested in the premise for some reason"
WHAT
HOW IS SUPERNATURAL EVEN REMOTELY SIMILAR
i'm fucking losing it
literally none of these shows except like, maybe community if you really stretch it, are remotely similar to karate kid
supernatural especially is like a galaxy brain comparison
you can't escape tipsy, why try
accept that you will forever be stuck in the quagmire of pervasive adolescence
i mean nat you drink soda like an abandoned toddler so i don't think you really have room to talk
i mean, is there anything in the survey results that's particularly interesting
what are the results
what do the numbers look like
like, total number of users who responded that they typically use x platform
an example of the stuff you're leaving out is like the votes comic right
i don't necessarily agree with bambosh inasmuch as i think that it's important to like... whitewash historicity, and to leave out details just because they might make people uncomfortable
in spat i at least _tried_ to include all the gritty parts that make us look bad too
but, it's his project and he's able to decide what the ultimate purpose of it is, if it doesn't fit with his aims that's perfectly fine
that's probably the most balanced way you can approach it given the ideals of preservation vs conscientiousness
homestuck poisoned our water supply, burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houses
that made me laugh really hard, just imagine someone who learned to call black hair "hitler's hair" so that's how they ALWAYS refer to it
i think that's kind of the thing nat
these aren't racist in the way of "i hate black people and this is how i will represent it," they just occupy a weird space of "why on earth did he make this and why are they so uncomfortably centered around black stereotypes"
it's _very_ fucking strange
pronounced scam-ay-ees
the gay one isn't really offensive as it's not about a caricature
that doesn't really answer the question of "why"
appeal to absurdity is kind of compelling but i don't think it's the entire answer
oh man
it's been a while since we talked about _this_
humans without knowledge of good and evil still get punished for breaking laws and rules
besides, we've already been punishing animals that fuck with humans for millenia
I tried to use retroarch once and was immediately fucking irritated by most of interface
That was years ago however,  has it gotten ANY better?

ween
why
it's unbelievable how prolific he is, honestly
etiquette is basically a fancy word for "manners"
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
cheeze has achieved fame in the worst way possible
which one do you want to play most
then tell them to wait and think about it
what about your foot
i know i'm going to regret asking that but whatever
oot has been around for 20 years and can wait, i don't know shit about p4g or pokemon reborn but i know hollow knight is really good, especially if you already enjoy metroidvanias
NO
SSSSSSSSSSSTOP
alright after a long day of enjoying myself, i'm finally in bed
did i miss anything worthy of discussion
well, i didn't expect that combination of words
nice
oh sweet i was wondering about that
fuck adam sandler, fuck retroarch
oh yeah i saw that twitter post
thankfully i had an excuse to stay out of that conversation this time
got a post i can read about the zelda brawler tho
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
this is on a whole other level
i don't think i want to entertain this discourse for two days in a row
let's move on to something less abjectly contentious
no more incest discussion you sick fucks
stop
next person to ask a question or continue the discussion gets a day ban
GUYS
HOLY SHIT
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
how do you think bernie sanders feels about the internet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4yFvZZ1c8s
oh i was scrolled up a bit
to be discouraged at all costs
WHAT
you can laugh, you can cry
perfect

animatronics are a blight upon humanity for multiple reasons
what are you looking for again
wait a second is that our hadron
no it's not nevermind
i don't know why i thought hadron would be running TAS of mario's mystery meat
... i see...
why is the plok ost so fucking good
that game doesn't deserve it
tera this TAS is giving me a lot of enjoyment tonight, thank you
this is my favorite one
she reminds me of chell from el dorado
what's exactly like this
well sure
she do got that chill aesthetic
bweee
TO WAR
why are there so many entertaining shitty simulators
so ck is like... world domination then?
i assume that the attraction is in slowly expanding your control until you eventually reach a point where your victory is assured
i wear it with honor
i wouldn't curse people
i'd be a benevolent hedge wizard
do you actually
how weird woc, so do i
but it's not as cool as that, i just bought it at the ren faire when i was 10
it's a big, ungainly thing with a resin orb at the top
has a nice little fake leather grip
üî™
not for a while as far as i can remember
<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
even if it was, hit me

ah, fair

oh, i never noticed that the D on the zoom in is slightly darker
am i missing a joke here
i just thought he stared real close at the sign for a bit and then got the fuck out of dodge
that it doesn't actually spell "write," right
yeah, okay
that's what i initially thought but it's so underwritten
yeah no, it's just that the ‚úÖ is the straw that breaks the camel's back
he was already being crushed under the weight of his immeasurable suffering
i'm 90% sure that the comic where it's molly tending to roast beef and the captions about "sometimes marriage is" was a product of chris onstad going through a divorce
yeah
he got divorced from his wife at some point
unspecified if i remember right, he mentioned it after 2010 but it might have been earlier
jesus christ chris, you wanna talk about it
gracefully
he won't be faceplanting so much as giving the appearance of laying down for a nap, and simply never waking up
i like to think he started doing this more often after his dalliance with the stripper
this arc is really fucking good yeah
also i think the great outdoor fight arc is popular in general for the sheer nonsense and volume of solid one liners
there seems to be a lot of merch surrounding it, i imagine that it got a lot of attention

wait, was there news about it today? i thought it would come later this week
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
hey, i'm kind of okay with this
i don't know if it's possible to get another undertale where discussion of it lasts for three fucking years
it'll be good to spread it out
YOU! _Can stay._
polly is fucking metal

lmao, holy shit
there's so much of this shit that's just genuinely great
spoilered because slightly NSFW language
i'm sorry we judged you goob
I PROVED MYSELF A COWARD WHO WOULD DESERT A DYING MAN
ah, you know what it is
teodor called her "poppy" and i was probably really tired when i read that
cuz cornelius says "not to my knowledge"
and my brain must have immediately been like "shit they're not seeing each other anymore?"
i'm gonna keep reading through backlog just in case i'm being a dumbass
makin has this absurd notion that a comic is completely ruined if the words share image space with the actual drawings
i understand where he's coming from but it's still dumb
wow, the old days
damn dude you have to wonder how much stuff like this came from the heart, like he experienced it himself at some point
phillipe going home arc is fucking kino too http://achewood.com/index.php?date=03302010
read here onward
what the fuck is with the pink floyd dark side of the moon cover
wait, so does CK really not have like a win condition
that's actually really helpful contextualization
but that also sounds like it'd be hard to get much enjoyment out of it for me, personally
i like having a concrete goal to strive for, and i have trouble making some up for myself
is it possible to remove the timer and work towards total global control
fuck yes
FUCK yes, alright
i will absolutely give the game a solid try
i guess that ck is the kind of game that's way more fun if you have some background knowledge about world history, yeah?
<:GWcorbinMonkaGIGA:384871327292588054>
yeah of course
what's not to love about patricide
fuck
i took a gamble
i couldn't remember if "patricide" referred to both parents or just the father
protip if you're talking about both it's "parricide"
yeah, what the fuck
god help us all
infants are a shit ton of work
good old pu
yeah i think that's on the maid for bringing it up
apropos of nothing, i mean
<@!193814482420498432> explain yourself
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
jesus christ
how does this happen
i'm just preparing for disappointment
can't lose doing that
<@!257144766901256192> good bye
yes gnawms
er, wow
misha
yes, i do
good? no, not by any means
better? yes, almost certainly
his personal qualities and failures aside, he wouldn't be doing... all this
i say as i wave my hand around
_sigh_ alright let me pull up the list
weird, the resource i usually use ended up going down in april, thankfully it's still available on archive.org
have a list of nearly 2000 things with references https://web.archive.org/web/20200205170142/https://paperspaperspapers.wordpress.com/2017/01/25/the-everything-terrible-the-trump-administration-has-done-so-far-omnibus/
misha, here's the thing
you specifically asked whether biden would be better
the answer is yes
he would not be GOOD
i do not look forward to a biden presidency
i do not like biden
but he is no trump
you are being a contrarian jackass
okay, if you want to frame it in terms of economics that's fine
let's bring up the fact that trump took no proactive measures to strengthen the economy's defenses in the case of something catastrophic happening to the stock market, which then came in the form of the pandemic, which he did nothing to prevent or halt the spread of, and then has displayed zero leadership in convincing people to take responsibility and keep it from getting as bad as it has, which has led to enormous amounts of layoffs and contributed to the already staggering level of wealth inequality
instead of raising interest rates and securing better conditions of workers the government has just spent something like 7-8 trillion dollars in qualitative easing which is going to come back and fuck us in the future because it massively increased our debt and basically none of that passed down to the common man
no lat, biden definitely trash talks
i think you may be confusing "stuff that doesn't matter" for "stuff that doesn't motivate people quite as much as it shold"
by which i mean that your arguments are talking about the more performative aspects of his presidency, which sure, are important
i'm arguing in favor of the principle of the thing
trump's policies with regard to immigrants and women's rights are also massively regressive and despicable
you're saying that those things don't matter because people don't care
i'm saying those things matter because it affects people
lat, at this point i'm resigned to thinking we just can't win no matter what
by "we" i mean, like, poor people
the common man
and i don't mean to cast assumptions about your wealth in that regard, i mean "poor people" as in "anyone who isn't fuck rich billionaire"
because we believe the alternative is worse
our democracy doesn't really function very well
ifnar, that's the idealistic view of it
the realistic view is that it comes down to two people, and if you vote for a third party you weaken at least one of the two
ifnar you have like a parliament system don't you
where you form coalition governments and stuff
we do not have a parliament, we have a house of representatives and a senate
coalition governments don't happen here
the way our electoral system is set up, it tends to favor the establishment of two dominant groups and everyone else gets chopped liver
at least i can agree with you guys on that
b3es, natural disasters have shown a small but consistent uptick in the last ten years due to climate change caused by increasing global temperatures
i think what lat is trying to suggest is that even if it's just "kind of worse than normal" for now, things aren't going to go back to how they were
politically and environmentally we're frogs in a pot of water that's getting hotter every year
not everyone feels it yet, but it'll happen
there's also a large group of people who are going to get fucked hard by climate change six ways to sunday
the number of displacements caused by climate change will probably reach the hundreds of millions
which is going to cause political problems due to expats and refugees
two things
first
that was an extremely rough night and i look forward to not repeating it ever
second
why are we talking about this
don't worry mint if you're like me you're straightedge until you're of age and then you start slowly dipping into mixed drinks and wine coolers
next thing you know you're downing like nine kamikazes and absorbing half a box of wine in one evening
i highly recommend it tarty, at least once in your life
it gives you a newfoudn appreciation for not being extremely drunk
oh that reminds me that i came up with a slight variation of the kamikaze that i simply called the golden wind
instead of lime juice you substitute lemon juice and lemonade and just add more vodka
also i hate you, "the piss fart" made me laugh way too hard
"hey guys wanna try this mixed drink i came up with called the piss fart"
i'll try the zombie some time later woc, i'm giving it at least a couple weeks between my evenings indulging myself
for anyone not aware, tipsy has been ragging on me--appropriately--for casually drinking too much, and some of the other mod team echoed her sentiments
yeah but i don't want to become an alcoholic
the mere fact they voiced their concerns is something to take into consideration
so instead of getting really drunk four times a month, i'll just get really drunk like three times a month
easy come easy go
stop making me want to play new things while i'm playing higu
yeah, that's almost certainly satire
"sweet catch bro"
fuck, someone post it quick
CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRABBO
why are woc's forced memes so good
fuck you <:robotass:752311525699485717>
enough
NO
THAT'S ENOUGH
LET'S TALK ABOUT WTC
WHERE ARE THE CANDLES, EGGMAN
how about "gnawms is banned" twice instead
gnawms is banned
gnawms is double banned
how long has walking dead been a thing
like, over a decade?
jesus
yeah
i was just thinking the same thing
TOO LATE
YOU FUCKED IT UP
<@!111477124384202752> SEVEN YEARS DUNGEON <@!146014279529791488> EXECUTION FOR STAYING ON AFTER IT EXPIRED
this topic sucks
how do you play mahjong
dimly, i only watched it a couple of times
probably why it got cancelled
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
can't believe the dream is dead like this
fuck kyou
"I'm glad that Japanese anime shows up on Google even in the US. Saitama's face appears higher in the [thing I'm not aware of but probably a different "Saitama"] map when you search that word, and Mob Psycho appears higher in the search than actual mobs. It's so high that President Trump's son thinks it's a conspiracy to keep the current protests and riots off of Google searches."
that's definitely it then yeah
i have no fucking idea what that is trying to say
/r/woosh
i agree that it was too obvious though, you should have searched for "cute anime girls wearing MAGA hats"
that would have been just believable enough
... those exist, right
hoo boy
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
i fear a return to caveposting
because caveposting is very powerful
it's like a rolling stone, difficult to stop
>be durg
>watch friends talk
>friends start to hoot and scream
>notthisshitagain.cavepainting
>tell friends to go back to cave or i throw them out of tribe
>"hey durg, you put fingers in dirt again today? huh huh huh huh"
why not
it's two disparate groups who fight with each other for control or dominance
that's the basic essence of a military conflict
INTERNET? LARGE CITIES? MEMES?

YOU FELL FROM THAT TREE PRETTY HARD. COME ON, LET'S GO CRACK OPEN SOME COLD MANGOES WITH THE MONKES
alright i shouldn't be enabling this
no more monke posting either
fable's a great game, what's your problem
D-> channel ban <@!274676805372215297> having wrong opinions
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
no, it's just actually a great game
it's fucking fun
i'm getting pretty close to be honest
it means it's happening
that's not a joke
she can come back in an hour
deri
also she can't speak here so it must have worked
there it is

i agree with spiral, albeit mildly
i'll eat peanut butter but not a lot of it, i had too many peanut butter sandwiches when i was a kid and i'm permanently turned off of the stuff
unreleased games? oh shit
anything interesting
wait, i should have asked this many hours ago, but do we have a release date for deltarune chapter 2
damn
when was the news actually supposed to come out
<:thonk:538981238082502677>
i mean, it's possible they'll find a more efficient architecture too
hm
i wonder if you could safely operate a computer off of a microSD
god, what a fucking time we live in
i mean, shit, what's stopping me from operating a computer off of any old flash drive
oh yeah, that's fair
NEED for SPEED
does anyone feel like reinvigorating some POLITICAL DISCUSSION?
"no" okay
terrible
that's the spice!
ugh
i mean, feasibly we could do it tonight
who all is interested
yeah
i'd be down for that
doesn't have to be super late, could be like
i dunno
figure it out, i'm tired
that's neat
that's because it's none of those things
it's a cash cow
and also a game for creepy sex perverts yes
some snakes lay very still when they get frightened, especially babies
yikes
pulling shit out of your ass because you don't know what else to do
where else have we seen _this_
i mean, rey's origin isn't the point of the series, and at one point had been "concluded" by saying she was essentially "from nowhere"
i would honestly have preferred they kept it at that, because dynastic characters are getting super old
we don't need skywalkers or kenobis or yoda or palpatines
we need fresh blood
so the mystery aspect of her origins should have been squared away by saying "you came from no one special" and just have her be a whole new thing
and then put more focus on the stuff that actually mattered, like ben and the conflict writ large
yeah true
deus ex posters get out
i said OUT
maloid...
misha i want you to know that i was going to look up the amount of calories in a half-rack of ribs but when i looked back at google i had typed in "maloid"
i actually really enjoy critikal's commentary videos
there's one where he evaluates "the worst rappers in existence" and it makes me laugh pretty hard
yeah it's great
naah
i mean, it's definitely not for everyone
but he's pretty imaginative with some of his insults, and his commentary is actually pretty observant
"blah blah blah blah _gum disease_ blah blah blah"
misha: PANIK
oh yeah, i should put out a notification
<@&711911237700681789> after a lengthy absence of game night, we'll be trying to do Among Us this friday at 8 PM EST
make sure you have the game downloaded and ready to go
try to come prepared but if you're not that's okay, we'll figure it out
no
no it is not
i've said this before but people are intimately familiar with ss13 are way, way too quick to pass it off as being "not that complicated"
ss13 has an insane learning curve and every time this discussion comes up i feel like i'm talking to a fucking brick wall about this particular thing
it's not the combat dude it's _everything_
figuring out the myriad of roles and knowing what to do at a given time, how to work with the interface
perhaps that's what it is
ike, i'm willing to accept that ss13 may not actually be all that bad IF you get into it in a more typical fashion, ie joining a big server with people who know what they're doing
it's much harder when you're in a server where one, two, or three people max know what to do at any given time and everyone else is fucking around hardcore
or are simply confused
after having played the game for about 50 hours, no
i mean, what is your definition of "getting into"
obtaining any sort of competency? no
becoming interested, sure
i don't know, i just think veteran ss13 players are insane
they have no perspective of what it means for someone to get dropped in with no prior experience
what no i was actually enjoying the game when we played it together
i figured out basically every medical role and some of the science ones
as well as learning some engineer stuff like supermatter and relays
it just takes _time_
there's a lot of shit
i will never forget the ass sheets
for anyone not familiar, i was a surgeon one round and was trying to initiate surgery on someone with appendicitis
first step is to put a surgical drape or a bedsheet over the area you'll be working on, which in the case of an appendix is the groin
i went to put it on but i had it on the wrong action setting, so i ended up shoving the bedsheet in the guy's ass
while i'm trying to figure out what i did wrong, the guy just says "uh" so i panic and try to do it again, and end up shoving a _second_ bedsheet up his ass
eventually i did get it right and put him under for the surgery, during which i covertly removed both bedsheets from his rectum
i actually dislike that cloning is gone but i guess it was pretty overpowered
how does resurrection work now
oh there's a surgery for it now
okay sure
sounds funny to me
lmao
i always feel that ss13 is best enjoyed with soft RP
i've done a few hard RP rounds but it's kind of stressful
total lack of RP is just boring though
that's far better
i would love to read a SPAT-like about these servers someday
they sound fascinating
i often wonder about people like that
where do they come from, how did they get to that point
i don't understand though, who would sponsor someone talking about food and drink besides food and drink companies
it wouldn't make much sense if omahasteaks advertised itself to people who play xbox
i'm sure it's logical, just for some reason at this moment my brain has fucked itself into thinking it doesn't make sense
i guess it's about diversifying your audience
or something
who cares, this topic is dildos
i think ck2 is a different beat
all the time, pal
you just know she made bank
guest speakers are a mixed bag, there's no way around it
boligatory: you must the ball
so segregation is coming back i guess?
that's very cool, thanks modern social movements
i mean, you can plat cities out too, but you have to be fuck rich or get a bunch of moderately rich people involved in order to accomplish that
cool ice cold take dude
like, i think people understand that principle dero
we're not talking about abstract philosophical ideals
we're talking about real spaces that exist
OBVIOUSLY no one would be judgmental about this kind of shit in a perfect world, but that ain't the world we live in
it's much more interesting and prudent to discuss the reality of the matter and understand it as thoroughly as possible
i'm dero, `suuuuuper genius!`
don'tcha knoo
my name is cade, i have a identical twin brother named cael
dero calling you ben shapiro was fucking banter
holy shit, why did that make me laugh
those are rookie `takes` you gotta get those `takes` way up
also when did we become actual 4chan
don't make legit 9/11 jokes you fucking idiots
ugh
you know, i can't even dispute that, because there are plenty of 9/11 memes i enjoy
ALL THOSE PEOPLE
ALL THOSE HAMBOIGAHS
the chairg????
oh the _chairs_
like this?
yeah it's a very new feature
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
value 1.29
too long, the TTS gives up after about three or four sentences
the last time i took a pacer test, some of the people in this server hadn't even been born
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
yeah i fucking bet
oh shit, are you serious dero
that's not a small number considering the average class size is less than 100 people
there are going to be some dead kids from our town by the end of the year
people are lucky it doesn't affect everyone equally
we'd be seeing a LOT more deaths if it had like a 75-80% death rate
thanks b3es
you know what, you're right, but not for that
i meant the INFECTION rate
not the death rate
anyway, how about a little levity
i was in the same place as when that happened dero, buying a little chocolatey milk before going into the city
someone was jawing with the clerk because they knew each other, his total came up to $5.06
and then he goes, i shit you not, "haw haw five oh _sex_"
i wasn't actually sure if i heard it for a second but of course, that's our hometown
also i'm going up to the college town later to get a bit of stuff and dinner, you wanna come
ain't no good for fishing tonight
die
you want me to pick you up a cigar for bennet next week then
ooh, frittata
sure thing
no discord is just dumb
don't be a skunt
i have no idea what a skunt is but don't be one
just that, picking up a cigar for next week and some food
like... 20 minutes max
depends on when grandpa gets home
orly
it sucks tho
welcoem to my life chat, it's fishing and depression
oh yeah true, that'll be good
No
<@!146014279529791488> oh shit he's already here, i'm gonna get ready and head over now
prepare yourself or die
see you later lit, i've got some fish to not catch
if anything cool or funny happens we'll post the footage
Bweeeeeeee
how many years were they working on this again? like four/
lmao
nevermind
i wonder what i'm thinking of
nice
oh that's no fun
who wants to see a picture of me, dero, and beeger
<a:pensiveWobble:530000479401279490>
rip phillip banks
who ever lived
anyway here's a nice one

demon beeger didn't feel like coming out but this is close
<@!146014279529791488>
beeg is fucking menacing but is very old and doddering
she's basically completely blind
oh yeah baby girl is a living meme to be sure
i'm not as familiar with her medical history, dero would probably have to explain
pretty sure it's old age
like, cataracts and stuff
i don't remember how old she is unfortunately
definitely up there though, like over 10 years old for sure
they had a scare recently but hopefully she will continue to bare her fangs on camera for a while to come
aw man umbra, that's really sweet
glad she's still going strong
my gf had a nice cat ever since she was like 4, called sweetpea
she died a couple years ago though, at over 20 years old
she was really busted up about it, but sweetpea was a good cat
IT'S DESTINY, RIKER

lieutenant yar
that tweet is a masterclass
that image reminds me of a story my uncle told me when he was moving to south carolina
my uncle is a devoutly religious man and was looking for a church to join
one of them had this priest who was very friendly and talked to him a few times before service
then after learning my uncle is a scientist, during the sermon one time, the priest pulls this out: "E = mc^2... _proves_ the existence of god."
with no further explanation
i don't think so but i can't recall
yeah no kidding
churches are steadily seeing a drop in attendance in the US, aren't they
could be that they were just desperate to retain some newcomers
biological design is complicated but it's completely within the realm of possible understanding
just need to get better at computers
make them do all the work for us
the doctors were too big of pussies to call it a vag worm
i think so but i wasn't present for it
to be fair lactose intolerance is actually kind of the default, people who developed the ability to drink milk are cheating
no, lactose intolerance is an _asian_ thing
Shut up!

i'll ping one more time an hour before we start
voice chat would be optimal
no i'm playing higu
yeah part of the fun will be how much of a shitshow it is
l4d2 logic
i'm not that surprised by it, they're all turbonerds and he's vaguely in our assortment of weird by using the internet/playing games a lot
i've seen this image before moon, a very long time ago

i have no fucking idea what cool world is
<@!115845617007329280> that's a pretty sick spider
i imagine getting cut or especially shot is an effective reminder of how pliable and destructible our meat cocoons are
i support the spiderposting initiative as long as it's really interesting spiders
people need to go outside =

millipedes are actually harmless
centipedes are the ones you need to look out for
centipedes are fond of biting and many species are venomous, some being extremely dangerously so
also they look like fucking alien creatures

god damn it, i'm trying to get a picture of this hummingbird that keeps coming to my feeder but he always sits on the opposite side of where i am so i can't get a picture
hm
how does this guy have work, honestly
yawn
we'll do babylon 5 _eventually_ in fairness
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
wow, someone who actually feels like hounding makin after all these years
most of the time we just give up
misha you're getting bobbed hard m8
i feel kind of bad because i was considering voting for babylon 5 and just didn't get around to it
i have to admit, it's kind of pointless
swagmeister over here
misha i'm kind of irritated when makin does this too but letting it ruin your whole day is kind of silly man
it's not going to take six months, it'll be like one month at most
we go through streams pretty quick
how long is farscape

what a day, my dudes
that's completely within his right i guess, but it seems really self-defeating
you want your friends to enjoy watching it with people, right
why make yourself and them miserable by denying them the opportunity
yes, we will watch the thing eventually is the point i'm making
after this the only thing left IS babylon 5
there's no other thing
i don't know what other shit he was talking about but no one gives a shit about it
seriously, you should take a break and try to relax
i'm gonna be playing higu if you want to talk about that later
mr boomer...
b3es how old even are you
thought you were aroudn my age--yeah
```11th of September
Today, we ignored a national tragedy in favor of watching Misha go nuclear over Makin rigging the next show to stream.```
misha that's kind of the problem, the fact that this is all completely unironic is kind of disconcerting and increasingly dumb
well what am i supposed to do about this then
this passed "egregious" ages ago
what, i'm just supposed to let you vent your anger all over the chat for... how long has it been going now? like an hour?
an hour and a half?
i don't really want to do that, i'd like to resolve this more peacefully
i just feel like he's riding the monkey
yeah it stopped being funny after like 10 minutes
alright, hit me up man
yes, essentially
you're completely in the right to be angry, it's just that it's hogging the channel
like, i get it, i hate when makin does this too
for fuck's sake
<@!165162590878695424> makin had a poll today about what to watch next for weekend streams, it was basically between babylon 5 and farscape but with some dumb spoiler option called Person of Interest, for most of the time bablyon 5 was ahead in the poll but then farscape pulled ahead and makin called it, i don't remember if that was just The Appointed Time the poll ended or what
i'll tell you one thing, we're not watching person of interest before bablyon 5
i've actually been fairly interested in watching b5 for a while
i don't care all that much personally but seeing it get undercut like this is pretty irritating
no tensei, i actually kind of dislike when makin does this sort of thing
misha did explain his backstory but when have i _ever_ been a fan of makin munchkining stuff and fucking with things for his own benefit
in fact,vR is right
_i'm_ the admin now
i don't want to make him turn over farscape, but we are doing babylon 5 next or else i'm dismantling his announcement perms and rescinding his access to the cytube
AFTER farscape, i mean
why
the vote doesn't matter because makin can literally just manipulate it in some way that suits what he wants
he ended it today the second farscape pulled ahead
if he's going to do stuff like that, why bother having a poll
yeah precisely tensei
instead, makin decided to post a fake poll specifically to jerk people around and manipulate it into making his preference appear legitimate
before we just kind of accepted that because he was in charge and we couldn't do anything about it
i don't gotta put up with that now
you're saying that it's just a haha funny thing that doesn't matter, yes
he can stream it all he wants
the things that set it apart are that he has access to <#164122260913913857> and uses my cytube for it
okay, so you agree with me that i shouldn't allow him to use announcements for this
i would be perfectly mollified if makin conducted the poll again and had a proper cutoff time so it wasn't just him waiting for his option to pull ahead and cutting it off there
no, i just didn't because i was lazy
yeah, it would be a shame if we were all immature babies who, instead of actually conducting a proper poll, just ended it as soon as our choice started winning
reactions probably
like so
<@!742574918386057296> he has announcement perms and shares control of the cytube, i think that would count as power in this circumstances
like i said, we're doing farscape this time regardless because makin is already preparing it
but next time it's babylon 5
holy fucking christ
i stepped away to help my poor, dying grandma for 10 minutes and things are still going
i SPECIFICALLY SAID that there will be no redo but we're doing babylon 5 after farscape or else i kill everyone
now BEAT IT
WHAT
THE WORST SHILL?
<:UNRELENTINGTRASH:456927328929316865>
let us all rejoice in the miracle that is Fat Husky
that's right
i am correct, always, and no one else is
fulattu fucku furidei
makin's a big guy
yes
she literally never has to work again a day in her life
that's the dream
some people work every day for 50 years, some people get a rich guy to shit on them
and here we see the fundamental divide between idealism and pragmatism
should anyone be forced to choose between a billion dollars and literally letting someone shit on you for a billion dollars? no
is that the world we live in? yes
alright i've had enough
i don't even know what to say
except "stop talking about this"
i'm gonna give it a few minutes while i check on my laundry, i'll unfreeze it when i come back
in the meantime, think about your lives and the choices you make
NO
DO NOT
do not talk about this literal shit again, or else
WHAT
THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING
I DIDN'T FREEZE THE CHANNEL SO YOU COULD ALL MOVE IT IN HERE
<@!227181775221161984> i swear to fucking god i see you type "i'll get shat on for a billion dollars" anywhere else i'll fling you into the FUCKING SUN
you have one chance
make it count
holy shit, that's my edit and i didn't even fucking notice
my thought process was like "hah, doesn't that image usually have text or something" -> "wait, it does actually, what happened to the text" -> "oh shit it was just edited out" -> "OH SHIT I'M THE ONE WHO DID THAT"
what's up tera
what about it
oh, here, let me answer: "i have no idea what the fuck you're talking about"
the worst is "i'm one sixteenth cherokee"
that's because that's me
i AM one sixteenth cherokee
the rest of me is just european mutt
yeah misha i have never had anything that remotely chad happen in my life
do i need to recount the truth or dare story for you
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
alright, this story is NSFW so children should cover their eyes now
i grew up in a small country town with all of the cultural issues that accompany that
one of my friends in high school was this 17 year old pregnant chick who was pretty far along by the end of her junior year
i had a number of friends who would come over occasionally and as high schoolers do we all played truth or dare on the back porch or out in the yard at night or whatever suited us
my pregnant friend got a dare to do a dance topless, so she whipped her shirt off and did the deed, but she danced a little too hard and breast milk came out and got all over us
we stopped playing truth or dare after that
no, this is "my life isn't boring it's just trashy" story
yeah believe it or not this is common fare out here misha
not the part about breast milk getting all over people but y'know
why would i embellish it
this is the cold reality of what it's like to live out here
the modern culture of the common midwesterner
i don't even doubt you misha but i kind of want to know
i have a morbid curiosity of people being sick fucks
i think growing up and seeing shit like goatse has pavlov'd me into laughing when i see people be degenerate sickos
wait
wait
wait
do not send it here first
DM me
yes
it's not that much worse than my breast milk story, it just feels weird to read it as a story and not in a FB convo
<:squinting:538174601146925066>

^
alright, that's enough
we're going too far
no, no, just stop
misha is getting too involved
i want him to CEASE
<@!152254501376491520> i get it but don't shitpost like that, delete
i can do this all night
what the fuck
ah, i did it wrong
look, i'm laughing too, but i said this wasn't allowed here anymore
maybe if they didn't act like dumbasses and do things they shouldn't it wouldn't be such a problem
<@!280782538711236608> outstanding move but you knew what the consequences were, sorry buddy
<@!125433170047795200> <@!207991389613457408> you both can fuck right off
consumed with the urge to tts a spat entry now but i won't do that
it should be saved for special occasions only
oh yeah, everyone has the "read it to me" function now
let me find something
```8th of February

Viz announced on Twitter today that it‚Äôs launching its own Discord channel, including a link to said server. Although we weren‚Äôt sure how to react at first, out of curiosity a number of joined to see what the place looked like and how they were functioning. It quickly became apparent that the place is kind of a mess.

At first it wasn‚Äôt so bad, although Makin was cautioning us against joining. Some casual chatting happened, although there was a noticeable influx of Homestuck fans right off the bat. This increased in intensity for about half an hour, and then we noticed that users from splinter servers and people banned from the HSD in the past were arriving, such as Carborane and Smolmuffin.

As soon as this began to happen, the Viz server turned into a proverbial dumpster fire. It‚Äôs been a solid hour since I joined and the quality has been plummeting ever since. Trickster is ‚Äúresisting the urge to heavily shitpost,‚Äù and Makin has threatened to ban anyone from the HSD who is caught shitposting or breaking Viz‚Äôs rules.```
fragment from 2019
yep, it's still there


elections coming up this november
the object lesson here is that we are almost 2,000 times more active than the viz server
wait, let me check the fellow traveler discord too

not quite as ba
the viz server had as much activity this year so far as general on a bad day
the fellow traveler server has had as much activity this year so far as our server for one day
wait, is that tweet like unironic??
i feel nothing
yeah i agree, this is bad
no more stock images
alright goodbye
fuuuuck i guess i should play a few rounds of among us early so i can become familiar with how it works, but i also don't want to?
i feel like it'll be fun to sus it out and be a nuisance
it's like ss13 but much faster and less complicated
we're playing it tonight in an hour and a half
5 bucks
on steam
i mean, do you want in tera
i'll buy you a copy if you'd like to participate
alright, nevermind then
go back to sleep smoky the bandit
nice
oh yeah, forewarning, i WILL be drinking while we play
i don't want to hear no fuckin' sass
i don't even know i was just making fun of the fact that your lives are in danger due to fire
i was referring to people in your area but sure, that too
i don't think we will, but if we do i don't know
might have to take turns
what the fuck did you just say to me
yeah of course we're doing vc, no other way to do it
also damn dude i have been here before
ehhh
i don't know if it's that big of a deal qweq, also most of us i think will be trying to figure out the controls/rules
also yeah if you die you shut up
i'll remind everyone when we start
8 PM EST
i've watched nat play it
you just maintain systems around the space ship and there are traitors who sabotage shit/kill you
<@&711911237700681789> 45 minutes we're starting Among Us, make sure you have the game ready and we're all getting in vc. see you then, or else
nearly pinged everyone for that
i'm actually quite excited for it
i hope we all have a fun time and do it more
we also need to play poker again one of these nights, or superfight or something
i'm amazed at how small a game it is, too
like, it's only 250 MB or something
even higurashi's chapters are like two to three times that size
a VN versus a TTT game
pretty impressive work
i bet the among us devs are happy with the success they're seeing it
nice
yeah, i'll remind when we're in chat and about to begin
also can i say, a chicago song that i haven't heard very much but am enjoying _immensely_ is questions 67 and 68
mrnostalgic don't be silly, it is only 6:55--
this is why you're my favorite
at some point i'm going to make another scarf for you free of charge
gotta find a better way to get it to you though
oh that'd be perfect
i was envisioning something way more convoluted where i happen to be in mexico and come visit
i travel, it could happen
i already plan At Some Point to visit brazil so i can fuck around with misha and possibly qweq
if i'm traveling that doesn't matter
we'll just have to see
shut up just let me live the dream
i think what qweq is saying is that brazil has less infrastructure
we have an interstate system, i don't think they do
<@&711911237700681789> IT'S HAPPENING LET'S GO GO GO GO GET IN GAMING CHAT SO WE CAN PLAY AMONG US
get out nonpinger
this is fun as hell holy shit
yeah but if we get a few more we can try splitting groups

we're at 7, you?
no, people left
we need to recruit some
do you have among us
if yes, join the gaming chat and help them out
we should each have 7
i think that's a good idea, sure
as long as people want to keep going
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
yeah we're ready
that was really good
and people are still playing
we're definitely gonna have to do more
fuq u
shit was fun
i was too drunk to argue
indeed, an extremely fun experience
:0
hwa
i don't like being a villain it's mean
he's a strong, independent crustacean who don't NEED no exoskeleton
shower good
what i miss
no, she was banned
she was shilling hardcore porn games in gen and describing fetishes again
can't abide by that
unfortunately yes
she had ten thousand more warnings than other people got
what the hell is FFAK
i don't know what that is
we need like a MegaHusk emote because that's what reading that sentence felt like
it was like my soul got sucked out of my body
mac tonight
you know what, i fucking love vaporwave
i think it's my favorite musical genre because it has this quality of deep nostalgia mixed with faint regret
the fact that it mocks overtly capitalist elements at times is just icing on the cake
lat were you even alive when mac tonight was a thing
neither was i to be fair, it's a mid 80s thing apparently
no you god damn zoomer
mac tonight was a mascot for mcdonalds
a piano player with a crescent moon for a head
no, i'm  a late millenial
1994
when the fuck did mac tonight become associated with racist memes
is nothing fucking sacred???
i mean, not that mac tonight is sacred but he definitely wasn't RACIST
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPAHVS-e1NM
yeah i think this is an important distinction to make here
something can be used for racist ends while not being racist itself, it's like how rightwingers tried to turn clowns into an alright symbol
clowns aren't racist but they tried to make it seem that way
everything i love in this world is dead
anyway returning to the original topic...
i like vaporwave because it's the kind of music that in the right mood i can feel myself suffusing into and just forgetting everything else
there is very little music that i can do that with
you shut the fuck up rina this community is great and i will defend it with my life
mines this is pretty good, it feels on the heavier end of vaporwave that meshes with background elements, very loose and airy
synthwave is also good but suits me most in a particular type of mood
i think synthwave is for when i'm a little pissed off
i don't drink tea
i always extend my pinky when i drink things
force of habit
god mines this is so good
i'm just settling into it, it's like being in a lazy boy chair and it's so comfy that i start to doze off in it
entering a haze where youre not sure what's real or not anymore
i wish
well, lat
the first song on this is definitely interesting, i'm intrigued
it's also kind of anxiety-inducing
everytime the music shifts it makes my heartrate go up a little bit
it's a little panicking honestly
i think the art is part of it
very intense, with something new to look at when you focus on a different part of the picture
is the entire album like this
just constantly shifting between 3 second parts of various tracks
i don't think i can handle that, it feels silly to say but that feels like borderline frightening
the human experience is extremely weird dude
it might suit me in a different mood
i could see listening to something like that when i was in one of my manic states
like, okay
when i was finishing my master's degree, there was a period of a couple of months where i needed to start writing the larger part of my thesis and i just got no work done
i was constantly in a funk and wanted to do nothing but sleep
then out of nowhere i heard a song on the radio, peter frampton's sledgehammer, and it was like a switch flipped in my brain
i went from having no energy ever to having all of the energy in the universe now
i banged out 50, 60 pages in a _week_, and i feel like i would have liked this music while i was in that state of mind
peter frampton is a rock musician from the 70s and 80s
he has one of the best music videos of all time, with the song i mentione
wait a second
am i losing my mind
yeah, no, that's who i mean
disregard lat, i'm just going insane apparently
what, sledgehammer??
sledgehammer is like bona fide art, it's fine
but yes, peter _gabriel's_ sledgehammer
i listened to that song something like 300 times while i was working on my thesis
that and wang chung
it's not that hard cello, they have the same first name
yeah, i keep forgetting phil collins' name when i think about songs like coming in the air tonight
i don't even know why
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
i'm not sure how to feel about this
i am devoid of emotion
mines, my favorite so far was DMTV^2
i'm a sucker for tubular bells and/or music boxes
am i missing something here, does stormfront not refer to the altright website anymore
what even is the boys
the world's worst algebra proble
oh shit
you don't have the game night role
sorry nat
totally slipped my mind
this conversation doesn't read as horny to me, it just seems argumentative
yes, the key word is arguing
as opposed to talking about how much you want to fuck her or some other horrible nonsense
it is when we're in a server full of kids
i do understand that, but i've also learned to, you know, RESTRAIN IT IN SOCIAL CONTEXTS WHERE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE
it's not that hard
`bingo`
now that's how you argue in mspa-lit
yeah, that's absurd
romance does receive a fair amount of treatment in wtc
going by raw word count is farcical, it's more about the thematic consideration
even if the word "rage" only appears so many times in the iliad, the entire work is about that theme
tbere are also other, variously explained reasons why she doesn't make another void gun
it's complicated
every element in WTC has facets that draw on other elements, etc
i mean, i wouldn't call you a baby about it, but i definitely don't agree with your read on the description of solace
it's possible to describe someone in a context like that and not have it be rendered in a sexual manner
people make this mistake a lot and think they're equivalent
maggots
isn't it delightful
achewood truly tickles all of the emotions
including the bad ones
no, cornelius is a bear
he's very refined, don't let first appearances fool you
teodor and cornelius are bears, philippe is an otter, ray, pat, and roast beef are cats
lyle is a tiger
a solid proposition
<@!257144766901256192> consider it penance on your part for treating people like garbage
i'll remember you next time now that you've reminded me you don't have the gaming role
you already treat me like garbage you cock
thanks andrew
i don't care what you consider treating someone like garbage you SHIT
that's not how that works
i'll pick you up by your stupid little soda hands and throw you into a DUMPSTER
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
SAY THAT TO ME IRL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
i think i'm like, literally ttwo or three times your size
i would probably fucking destroy you if we ever actually ended up fighting
aren't you an engineer
you realize that size doesn't just correspond to area right
it's also a question of volume or mass
how much do you weigh, like six kilograms
555-COME-ON-NOW
we'll play again soon nat
relax you fuck
from lake beds and river deltas
about fourteen pounds
one must be careful, but it's possible
just don't
get out
i don't think it's a matter of people being unable to understand metaphors, it's more that people feel less bound by the discussion because it's not all that good of a metaphor
yeah tm, that's why philosophy sucks
philosophy specifically exists to simplify things and construct logical boundaries in a world where that stuff doesn't actually apply hardly at all
reject philosophy, embrace empiricism
DISCLAIMER: I AM JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKING
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> DOWNWARD SPIRAL
make child a be a chef you fucking morons
+pogress
which video game
is it a good one
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i don't understand what that argument is in favor of, tm
like, what is it trying to indicate
"shut the fuck up you snot ass kids, i'll send you to bed without dinner again i swear to god"
"if i have to hear about this flute one more time i'll break it into three pieces and shove each of them up your ass"
that's fucking great misha
inb4 "NO ONE SHOULD HAVE PROPERTY"
why?
why are you saying we _should_ have a stronger property norm
contextualization is important for making decisions in just about any arena of life
yeah you're basically arguing that people should think along pre-defined lines instead of properly considering the case that's in front of them and responding appropriately
that's a recipe for disaster
yeah, and look how that turns out for you
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
you're such a good sport, i appreciate you
anyway the object lesson here is that tm is M I S G U I D E D
yeah homer, this is actually how it used to be
i don't think most of the people here remember the thought experiment about how much you'd pay for a tool that instantly completes a task that would otherwise have taken an hour
that shit was _nuts_
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> MACHINE ARGUMENT 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
someone grab it, i have to get going because dero and i are fishing again
i'll be gone for a while so count me out
sorry i didn't catch farscape today
i might have to just watch it on my own
i'm busy enough now and my internet sucks that doing it on my own time is easier
i'd like to keep up to date so that i can discuss it though, so i'll work on it in my spare time
real briefly i want to describe something though
dero and i are taking a break from fishing for a bit, it's getting hot so we ambled back to the car and were shitting around like usual
we always make really shitty awful jokes that are just complete nonsense
so as we were packing up our fishing rods we were like "oh, be careful, you wanna treat them like a delicate baby"
"y'know, smash it on the ground, shake it real hard. feed it alcohol"
then i turned to look behind me and this poor guy was very pointedly not looking at us as he was packing up his bike into his car
spaghetti started flying out of my pockets like an angry bird, i mumbled "sorry dude" and we got out of there as fast as i could without seeming like a criminal
struggling not to laugh the whole time
god i love being outside
is that an important name nik
a word of power
i'd love to tell you
is this abroad in japan
there's value in creating things
as long as you don't mind that criticism, you're free to do anything
2.5 is on the slower bound yes
3 mph is pretty typical
but
you will not be walking 3 mph up a mountain trail
if you try to constantly hike at 3 mph, you will fucking die
unless you're very fit and used to the exertion
well, how high was the elevation gain
how many days DID they shoot this scene
yeah, but without knowing where the trail started, it's hard to say what the reality was
cinematography is hilarious
jesus fucking christ
i mean, ian mckellen is not a small dude
that guy looks like he has fucking thyroidal problems
hell, can you blame the guy in a way
you're playing aragorn in the lord of the rings
for literally any nerd that's a fantasy come true
i'm not sure what to make of that
lmao
viggo sounds like a really fucking eccentric dude
the nice part is that most of those ways sound pretty fun
now redpill me on viggo, what are some of the not nice weird things he's done
see? what a chad
no no, i was just covering my bases
i love viggo too, you just gotta make sure
oh god
oh god that looks horrid
what the fresh FUCK is that
you mean poop ballsack?
`Ah yes, Gimli's grandfather. What was his name again?`
coward
<a:WhatTheFuckDidYouJustSay:436715760245800971>
it does look kind of garish, but i'm also fine with that because most of WHF is more solidly colored from what i can recall, so having something bright and multi-colored is fine
those are great, holy shit
whoa

hidden update
no, i had never seen this ui feature
i mean, you have to click to see it
<:robotass:737043838761304084>
hm
someone post an emote from a random server they're in
i need to test something
yikes
shit
i wasn't paying attention and the chat turned into wh40k
is it time for death
i've been reading, not really paying attentino
i have a life outside of here, you know
higurashi
middle of chapter 6
i'm hooked like a fish
no idea what that is
i don't usually play VNs
never played umineko
shut the fuck up
shut the fuck uuuuuuup
we're going to BENDIGO
DESTROYED BY PLEB FILTER
thanks tarty, i appreciate you
when we were going fishing once, dero put that on and i just listened to the audio, and it started making me laugh uncontrollably
i don't even know if i would have found it as funny with the visuals attached
no
i'm still on higu
how long would it take you to download it
it's 250 MB or so
how long is umineko as compared to higu
alright then no, it can wait
then i'll get it for you next time we play
what was their reasoning, "it's already destabilized so there's no point hesitating"
CRTs are actually finding a pretty dedicated market with anyone who needs lagless monitors
the main appeal i can think of for that is video games
she sucks dude
i don't mean that she's hard, she just has a lot of really dumb bullshit
large periods of time where you can't hit her, and if you try, she floats away and extends that time period
well of course not
but headless aren't required minibosses
no, i'm just trying to say that o'rin is like the least fun minibos
her atypical patterns and timing are interesting but they just wrap around into bizarre and bullshit occasionally
yes she is
wait
```This boss is optional, however her fight will trigger regardless of speaking to her or not.```
???
how the hell does this work
if her fight triggers regardless, how is it optional
can you sneak past her or something
apparently you can just fucking RUN PAST HER
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IN THE 100+ HOURS I'VE PLAYED THIS FUCKING GAME
well
in hindsight i don't think i regret it
i don't want to toot my own horn or anything
but i think i'm probably the best sekiro player in this entire server
i completed a demon bell + no kuro's charm run recently, and then after that i made it all the way up to isshin with no attack or health upgrades at all
gave up at that point though because it was legit draining my sanity
i'll do that challenge and complete it another time
i see i've stunned you all with my prowess
allow me to break the spell binding all of you
_ahem_
i'm admin i can do whatever i want
truly, the power of admin abuse is strong in me
<@!125433170047795200> alright then, let's go to the guy's house and BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM
I mean, I can appreciate that
I like certain arthropods over others
They're pretty alien in many ways
oh fuck
Not the isopods!
I only like jumping spiders, they ha e a sufficient fuzz and eye factor
Most other kinds of spiders I can't vibe with
Oh I dont like go out of my way to avoid them or kill them or anything
There are some decently big varieties of spider that grow and breed around this time of year, in this area
I forget if they're called orb weavers or garden spiders
They're the yellow ones with the jagged web pattern
jesus fucking christ

i couldn't get a good angle to take the picture
but if you look closely you can see the left half is more red
that haze is the smoke from the california wildfires, 1,700 miles away from me
i wanted to get a much better angle on the picture
while i was coming home i looked off to the sunset and it was very clearly delineated: the sky around the sun was a bright yellow, and underneath the haze it was a dim crimson
i have _never_ seen that before
yeah, i can't imagine actually living over there right now
this shit is probably contributing to my allergies and it's not even obstructing things that much
<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
i've heard worse reasons to fight a fire
not many, but still
i coud tell you, but then i'd haff to kil l uyou
well, good news it's probably not coronavirus
covid-19 victims don't produce any mucous but i've been hacking up this clear crap all day
which is a deadringer for seasonal allergies
bad news is that i still feel like crap
i don't get sick hardly at all, this SUCKS
ror2 succ
lmao, this nonsense? this is the second time i've heard about it
who believes this garbage
that's the spice
is altgenstuck still going
jesus
it's been like 4 years
spiral spitting hot fire today
jobs fucking suck
hashtag anti-work
no, i doubt anyone would support it and i'm sure there are ethical quandaries with that kind of thing based on what i'm doing
i would continue to be a mediocre admin and be nice to people
me when i have to sell my soul just to afford avoiding death: <:Papito:755194422706176081>
damn, maybe i should just bite the bullet
i'm not exactly in a position that affords me much pride
if it were just me as like a regular mod or user, i would make one based on the fact that i write spat
but i'm the owner of this place so i'd feel like literally any attempt to make one would be viewed as abusing my position
it's probably not a good idea
no
when makin had a patreon for this server he had a tier for if people wanted to have their own personal channels
it was a fucking mess
yeah
30 bucks a month to talk like four times in your own playground
sigh
fine, i'm making one
but, i'm making it clear that there are no perks associated with here at all, it's just for people who feel like being supportive
though if it works well enough, i will probably divert funds for fun stuff people want here
no one can reasonably be expected to read spat, it's ridiculous
yeah making a patreon is stupid, nevermind
time to recede back into my hay fever
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
i'm not interested in making a patreon that has any explicit connection to this place
i do not want to make an "HSD Patreon"
it was not fine, it was contentious as fuck
this is moronic
look, full disclosure, i'm sick right now
i should not be designing a potential patreon that supports me and/or stuff we want to do in here
i don't even know if i consider it ethical or if it could get me in trouble
i'm getting hit by allergies really hard right now, been trying to just lay in bed
yeah
i don't ever get sick so it's hitting me like a sack of bricks
last night i was using this convoluted system where i connected a wireless mouse and used it to type on an onscreen keyboard, specifically so i could avoid getting out from under the covers
fucking homeopathy
makes my blood boil
yeah, the world is pretty okay in some regards
we're just in a relatively shitty time
it's easy to get bogged down in the stuff that sucks
it's hard to reconcile that the world can have wonderful things in it, as well as truly terrible things
i don't think lead poisoning caused the third reich to happen, it was people being susceptible to propaganda created by opportunistic people with an agenda
this is hardly the first time that sort of thing happened
yeah
the catalyst here wasn't a bad economy, at least not totally, it's more a long-running effort to instill nationalistic tendencies, reduce educational standards, and ramp up propaganda that preys on those respective properties
yeah, americans have always kind of been like this, if historical anecdotes are anything to be believed
there's that 1800s quote about never underestimating how much you can profit off of american stupidity, and then the ww2 quote about americans always doing the right thing after exhausting every other option
nowhere in my explanation did i say that this american trait is genetic, i actually agree with lat that it's mostly cultural
moonjail was talking to me aboe
shut it wieners
viruses are interesting
in my first two months of graduate school, i worked on a project where i was trying to determine the genetic elements of a common bacteriophage that allowed it to infect its host
this involved growing the host and the virus together in gigantic erlenmeyer flasks, and then inoculating slightly different strains of the host and seeing if any of them could be infected by new generations of the virus
we wanted to compare and contrast the genetic code of the virus before and after its ability to infect new hosts and see what exactly changed, which would give us an idea of where to look for the biological machinery that allows infection
it was freaky because multiple times, i ended up using a hypercentrifuge to specifically pellet the virions out of solution, though i can't remember why
so every week or so i'd have this plastic bottle where you could see a solid, vaguely milky lump about the size of my finger that was made up of nothing but viral particles
biology is fun sometimes
but yeah, the point of me bringing this up is to like, provide a more or less experienced opinion concerning working with viruses
they're highly malleable, and on top of that, there aren't a terribly large number of techniques for manipulating DNA, and what methods there are have highly specific pathways that experienced geneticists can probably recognize, especially with the use of computer analysis
i haven't read through the paper but i have no doubt that analyzing the genetic makeup of the virus to look for signs of synthetic components or tampering is entirely valid
lat i didn't have any enemies in graduate school because i'm not an edgy wiener who picks fights with people for no reason
it did not, in fact
i ended up googling what DNA tastes like out of curiosity
spoiler: it doesn't taste like anything
uh oh
yeah, people legit thought they were going to die
the dude who was responsible for that, i forget what happened to him
i'm not sure how much i trust the doomsday clock
it's basically a publicity stunt, isn't it
how are the people in charge of it accredited
get fucked idiot
too bad my car doesn't have an antenna because i would buy one of those in a fucking heartbeat
i got one of those headcrab hats for christmas like over 10 years ago or something
i still keep her in the back of my car, behind one of the seats
she's been all over the place with me
she's in the car, you'll have to wait until later
the crackers, gromit! we've forgotten the crackers!
wallace and gromit marathon when
a grand day out will always have a spot in my heart, it's so charming
they're not terribly long so i could probably get them prepared tomorrow and then we could watch them wednesday?
it's pretty fun carl, i wonder if you'd like it
how does wednesday sound then
i'll work on it tomorrow then
that dog looks so comfy
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that's kind of funny makin
i wonder if it's because you're a figure of infamy or if they were genuinely excited to have you there
i'm not even sure which of those options would be funnier
what's going on
oh yeah it's the kanaya drawing
fun shit
i do not have any fantrolls
i felt too old to start doing that kind of thing by the time i was invested in homestuck
if you want to make one for me go ahead, i'd be interested to see what you make
just don't be weird about it is all i ask
yeah no, we are pretty heavily against sharing personal details of official team members or staff
i have been godtiered
it's been a very long time since i took the test though
is there a good one, i might do it again here for fun
my initial result was heir of mind, then eventually it was knight of life
oh yeah, this reminds me that i wanted to make that patreon for group games
let me do that right now
no
the last patreon was advertised as something for the entire server
this will explicitly be something for this channel, as well as anyone else who happens to be interested
we need a concrete name for this channel, i hate trying to stick on a name because makin keeps fucking changing it
it's officially been too much time for newcomers to recognize "mspa-lit" too
suppressed nerd rage
no it's not
look how that turned out for us
i need a banner, 1600x400
cafe games is great
i still need a banner
someone make up some shit
i don't think so nat
gimme the deets
also, is the classpect test most used still that land of bells and celebration one
i wish it didn't have non-canon shit
what's the one everyone uses now
if i don't get a funny banner i can't put this up and we will never have games
cafe-lit will starve
oh
that works
<:Quiet:732864699779121162>
if only they had made that official class test
all of our problems would be solved...
<a:pensiveWobble:530000479401279490>
oh, lmao
i forgot that i turned off carl's react ban
for their birthday
i mean, they haven't abused it at all, so i don't see why it should stay
the end of an era
carl got react banned like three fucking years ago because they would add like a dozen reactions to EVERY POST

benis
in the flesj
yo, what the fuck
uh
hey salami what's up
yeah i'm a bit of a slow learner
what's ligma balls
anyway i'm in bed suffering from a fever
i kind of want to fuck some shit up
how about i ban literally everyone who talks after this message
D-> channel ban <@!344841674343841793> defying god
i think it was active in here at one point too
oh snap now everyone can use it in here too
i'll turn it back off when i feel like it
4 i believe, although we were gonna try doing 5 at some point
EE
DEE
EEEEEEEEEEEFF
the bot shall come again some other day
no, absolutely not
people who post horny in altgen will be killed on sight
that could be fun, i've always felt a bit sad that we never actually completed the game
i'm gonna choose the class i want most just because no one cares anymore
alright, i've chosen it
hmm
breath would work mint
witch of breath, in my opinion
they look cute from the underside but no
yeah, things are rather slow lately
i think it's fine until people start to blow up again
wrow
i mean, kinny talk can go south really fucking quick
FLAP
can't we all just get along
nah, if it's a real ban you typically get pinged unless it's an emergency/things are going too fast and it needs to happen asap
yeah, i've been seeing a haze over the sky for the last few days
it's cloudy today so i can't see it right now, but in the evening half the sky is normal sunset, and the other half is a deep red
if i get a good picture of it i'll share it here, the last one didn't do it justice
oh shit, the fuzz
i mean, assuming that your window has hard edges, it should also have a clear cut shadow
the fuzz is indicative of particle obfuscation
done, what next boss
i mean, any community living in a food-sparse region will have to resort to some very efficient processes to get their nutrition
kinography actually refers to cinematography, but in this case it's the extended form of "kino" which is internet slang for "art"
"good art" whatever
KINO KINO BASED CRINGE BASED KINO CRINGE
IS THAT ALL YOU PEOPLE EVER SAY
you insult rats by comparing them to that fecal matter
excuse m
no idea what you speak of
the only radio comedy show i ever bothered to listen to was car talk
probably
nipah
discussing it in terms of "entitlement" and "what people are owed" is extremely disingenuous
i think it's 100% valid and fair to be upset with someone who tries to upend your expectations in an unsatisfying way
it doesn't matter if anything was promised, there's a general understanding that something will happen
if that doesn't happen, and it's not sufficiently explained why that's the case, then upset will occur
i don't think anyone can reasonably be blamed for not being happy about that
lmao
what else could it be
nah, i was going to do that overnight
the internet here is so shite that it literally takes like 8 hours to upload a movie
OH WAIT
how's the update
yeah, that's not really surprising unfortunately
guess i'll go check it out
hm
okay, uh
does anyone want to help me set up wallace and gromit for tomorrow
i would do it myself but my download speed for these videos right now is literally 5 Kbps
show me
i miss playing music sometimes
i never enjoyed _performing_ though
i just liked playing with friends
guess what i've goooooooot

misha made it spiral
u wanna offer him some constructive criticism?
<@!207991389613457408> spiral is shitting on your banner
oh okay
who posted that scientific article about covid-19 being synthetically created in a laboratory
apparently that study is fake nonsense that steve bannon was supporting in order to further the administration's claims that china created the virus
tarty i don't know what you want
the person behind this study is literally a chinese fugitive who was found on steve bannon's yacht at nearly the same day he got charged with fraud on a federal level
guo something, i don't remember their name
i haven't personally read the article but it doesn't take someone with my knowledge in the field to understand that you have to take who's funding these studies into account
by its very _nature_ i am suspicious that it's bullshit, and i'm sure anyone with my level of technical expertise or especially higher would look at it and go "that is suspicious as fuck and i do not trust this article at all"
apparently the article isn't even peer reviewed so i double don't trust it
there are at least 70 people who casually use this channel throughout a given week
i literally kept track of this myself as an experiment one time
i wrote down people's names as they talked in here over the course of one week
it was part of my "determine who's a regular" experiment
not all of those people count as regulars, but they at least participated
and i'm sure there's a lot of lurkers besides, too
well, what else _should_ we talk about
suggest something or else suffer
imagine not using your dreams to iggliglio my gondola ggggggggggggg

samurai jack is a wonderful show
its ending was clunky as hell writing-wise but under the circumstances it was made, i don't mind it much

but i already sold my dogecoin
i cashed out when the coin hit 2 cents per

wait, you mean the last season of the original run or the last season of the entire show
there's a laptop in the common room before rounds start, modify your appearance on that

why did you tell us this
no, nevermind
i don't want to know
i remember it, you're just a wiener
i mean, how many times have you read it
lol
then yeah of course
i've read it around a dozen times
wait a second what
<@!111477124384202752> how are the wallace and gromit episodes looking
what is it with socks all of a sudden
dero and i are going fishing sooner than anticipated and i've gotta pick up some really thick/soft ones so my feet don't hurt in the waders as much as they did last time
yes, all 0 dollars so far
were you ever planning on watching it in the first place
it looks fucking awful
Just got done fishing for the evening
<@266807632390520833> do people still feel like watching wallito y gromitti
Yeah I had allergies for a couple days
Was mostly fine this morning, now I'm good
<@&693935623966425219> who wants to watch the first three Wallace and gromit episodes say aye
Well, gather anyone who's interested, if we have more than 10 I'll do it
<@!266807632390520833> i won't be back until tomorrow night either
we'll figure it out, sorry
and i oop?
every republican simultaneously becomes a furry
OH, MAAAAAAN

i thought it was just around the everyone ping, but no, today we lost 20 more people

HOLY SHIT
IT'S HERE

Why must things do this
Nah, I can connect to other wifi signals just fine

Nope, didn't help

mothafuckin bootleg video games
holy _shit_ there's even a fucking longplay of it
i know what i'm watching tonight
oh wait it's only 20 minutes long
whoa, holy shit
this fucking
intro screen is going WAY too fast
```The Pretty and virtuous girl Sodoma was Donkey Kong's friend, she was the spirit what charge of all the Plant in the world, she distributed sunlight air and water to each Plant everyday, so that they could grow up healthy and st





rongly......

But the lombado lived in the darksome correr didn't like the darksome correr didn't like the world full of green grass and bloomy flower. So the evil lonbado abducted Sodoma to arrest the growth of the life. From then on......

The flower bloomed no longer, and the tree blasted slowly......the banana and the wild fruit the Donkey Kong loved had been lacked too. The world became desolate at once...... 

There were no anything to eat, Donkey Kong felt very hungry, and the famine made him thinner and thinner, finally he became a monkey.```
jesus fucking christ this just keeps going
```The Poor Donkey Kong can but left the forest, began his difficult journey to search for food and save Sodoma.....``` nevermind that was the last bit
i should say that donkey kong becoming "thinner" was represented by his sprite simply transforming into diddy kong, leaving the forest showed him literally boarding a cargo ship, the profile selection screen is a rip off of wario land, and the music for the first level is a variation on ekruteak city from pokemon gsc
also donkey kong's attack involves him whirling around with a sprite that's blatantly stolen from the tazmanian devil in some looney tunes game
this game is like a showcase for just how much people can steal shit from other properties
ugh, guess i gotta transcribe that too
lmao
yes, good
that's what i like tos ee
qweq at any point in your life, did you ever think this was actually dkc5
fair enough
LOL
i do not
are STDs a problem in brazil? completely genuine question
well, just sounds like people are also smart about being promiscuous, so what's not to enjoy
anyway, can your stories be told in a way that isn't too explicit for like a 13 year old
you said it sister
i just spent half an hour looking up videos on how to properly fillet and skin trout
i'm getting too deep
like, soft??
soft brownies are the best
i can't stand hard/crusty brownies
i'm not going to lie i didn't even notice the "plant-based" there
i imagine it's far easier to have a vegan brownie than other stuff, like the replacement ground beef
85% of brownies are already vegan pretty much
i think so, anyway
what DO you replace eggs with if you need a binding agent
tensei, if you want to eat poop chocolate, i won't judge you, but you can enjoy it by yourself
baking powder is a leavening agent
surprise surprise, i looked up "binding agents in food" and the very first result is discussing potential replacements for eggs in vegan dishes
apparently potato starch and certain types of flour like tapioca also work and are naturally produced
is that actually what aquafaba is
i'm not going to lie, that sounds completely fucking rank
i have to give vegans props though, this is like space race levels of ingenuity
discovering new ways to cook shit
<:absolutelydisgusting:345034074815070208>
why?
who in their right mind would try to use the leftover garbanzo juice to try and cook more shit with
that's the sort of thing you'd expect to hear out of a crazy person
"SAVE THE LEFTOVER CHICKPEA WATER, YOU CAN USE IT TO REPLACE EGGS"
if someone said that to me i would immediately write them off as in need of medical attention
i'm sure a number of people did fuck with it, but it probably resulted in one of the following scenarios: 1) they decided the result tasted like shit 2) they decided the result was useless 3) they didn't even know what they were doing in the first place
why don't we watch more trashy tv shows
this sounds hilarious
oh my god, i have yet to grasp the full extent of the mess of this guy's house but it makes my fucking skin crawl just thinking about it
i see little details here and there and it's just irrationally irritating
just... tosses the carton on top of the trash bags, doesn't even put it in
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
wait
WAIT
WHAT
AM I SEEING THIS RIGHT
IS HE FUCKING COOKING IN ALEVE OIL
oh
yeah, what the fuck??
that caught me off guard so bad, i thought he was cooking it in fucking medicine
tensei, how do you find this miserable awful shit

stonestuck is fucking _amazing_
yeah, i'm kind of stunned
it's refreshing to have the experience of a clever and well-paced comic after all this time
it is a mystery
i feel like watching wallace and gromit soon
<@&693935623966425219> who up
<:pathetic:431861336943886336>
i mean, i guess it is pretty early in the day
keep forgetting that school is """"""""in session""""""""
oh damn
like uh
how did that happen
ah, so just a natural expiration of contract
carl we might watch wallace and gromit here, but probably later
good luck interro
i hope it all goes smoothly
what track are you, masters or phd
GREs are Graduate Requisite Exams, basically SAT/ACTs for graduat school
and just like the SAT/ACT, their standards are shit and it turns out they don't actually help determine how well a student will do in grad school
GREs will linger on forever, in the fringe if nothing else
at least you don't have to worry about them yourself
what are you planning on studying
right, but do you have anything in specific
that's still completely fine
you can have american football but leave baseball alone

our current understanding of science assumes it is, which is fine, because as far as we know it IS inviolab le
but our understanding of things also changes overtime
i'm not going to hold my breath, but saying "WE WILL NEVER EVER BREAK THE SPEED OF LIGHT EVER EVER EVER" is overly cautious
because it's explicitly precluding the possibility of it ever happening, when we have no idea what people might discover in the next x years
so what i'm getting out of this is that a wormhole is conceptually defined as an apparatus that allows you to travel from one point in space to another instantly from the perspective of the traveler, but makes it so that the external chronology is consistent and brooks no possibility of a paradox?
like, if you have a wormhole that allows you to travel one lightyear away, you step through and end up there instantly, but to external observers it looks like it took you a year to step out the other end
i mean, that's what it's like for light, if nothing else
from light's perspective, it reaches its destination instantly
why
ohh
at my destination
thought you meant at departure
also no
if it takes you a year to travel through in real time, then they would be able to use a telescope to observe you stepping into the wormhole a lightyear away and then you instantly pop out of the wormhole near them
stop monkeyposting
this conversation was actually interesting
i despise that you've overthrown it for the sake of poopflinging and monkiflip
i love that in stonestuck, there's some attention to detail about john's overall appearance and his mannerisms, but his name is literally just "unga bunga"
you'd only say that until you actually saw those olympics
the interest would be in the comparison
you need a regular human being with no training or augmentation, then a genuine olympian athlete, then the no-holds-barred guy
yes, if we're speaking no holds barred then we're also talking about like prostheses and other technology
also if just doping wouldn't be that interesting, then have an olympics where every competitor can use a drug of their choice, like meth or LSD or heroin
i mean, sperm cells aren't like eggs, they don't persist in the body perpetually after creation
they get cycled out continuously
that's not how that works though
no you fuck
that's not what i'm talking about
the gonads aren't this object that are permanently damaged when stuff comes in contact with it
it's like any other part of the body, it can be repaired
does your skin permanently fall off after you get a sunburn
do you even know how sperm is made
there's a structure in your testes called the seminiferous tubule which is lined with Sertoli cells and germ cells
germ cells are what meiotically differentiate to create sperm cells
germ cells are capable of mitosis and apoptosis, which means that if a germ cell is damaged beyond repair it'll kill itself to avoid spreading defects to the resultant sister cells
and if they're damaged within reasonable bounds they'll divide anyway and the damage iwll go away
it's why people eventually regain the ability to grow hair after going through chemotherapy
just because a cell gets damaged or is killed doesn't mean the function it filled is permanently disrupted, other cells replicate and fill in the gap so that the body continues functioning as normal
germ cells are one of the tissue types created during fetal development, it's there basically your entire life
it becomes activated during puberty through exposure to testosterone and testosterone related chemical signals
that's why i was informing you as to why that's not the case with sperm development
i mean, if you were to just cut the entire ballsack away then sure, it would be pretty fucking hard to have a kid at that point
but radiation treatment is also more selective than you're making it out to be
depending on the exact nature of treatment yeah, you could probably expect to be able to do that
i didn't say you're dumb or know nothing
if you look up to the origin of this conversation i said "that's not how this works" and then you kept contradicting me
i was going to explain but you kept interjecting with stuff that didn't apply or was inaccurate <:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
well that's what you get when you throw rocks and draw on the wall with your SHIT
yeah that is also understandable
i didn't say it wouldn't affect his nuts AT ALL, it's just that the body is more resilient than people give it credit for
you'd have to do some serious radiation damage to make his ballsack completely and permanently ruined
oh
"favelas" reminded me
i was talking with a colleague who studies social patterns in america, especially with regard to race and social stature
pretty hot topic right now for obvious reasons
i brought up the topic we had in here the other day about how race is much more important an idea in america than it is in other places in the world, like brazil
he didn't know anything about brazil's social structure, but he asked a question that i was curious and wanted to pass onto you both
what is the demographic make up of a typical city in brazil as opposed to the favelas
what was slavery based on in brazil
was it race or some other thing
yeah, that would make more sense then
here, post-slavery sympathies were fueled very heavily by which side of the war your ancestors fought on, and rather than being put to shame like the germans after WWII, there was little to no real punishment involved
people were allowed to fester with attitudes of white supremacy and jim crow made it so that every scrap of rights/privilege for black americans had to be fought for
i mean, yeah, abe wouldn't have been able to fix everything completely or do it withotu issue
but what we got instead was really fucking bad
probably would have been able to do a better job than johnson
i
yes
but i'm not arguing that the entire populace should have been tried
i'm arguing that there should have been better cultural reform
this just sounds like a guy who doesn't understand what a budget is
animation is great but it requires work

i'm too lazy to look it up, i don't care enough about dan harmon or his beliefs

```A lawsuit filed by the state in 2017 charged Lookhart with "unlawful dental acts," saying his patient care did not meet professional standards. He also billed Medicaid for procedures that were either unnecessary or not properly justified... The judge said the hoverboard incident was not the most serious aspect of the case....  Lookhart was found to have performed anesthesia "thousands of times without training or consent, on patients outside his scope of training and expertise, while stealing money from Medicaid and embezzling from his bosses," the statement from the Department of Law said.
Patients at the January trial also testified that they had woken up to find that Lookhart had worked on or removed the wrong tooth, or that he had performed a different treatment than what they had agreed to, KTUU reported.```

i enjoy evangelion plenty
i don't think it's the greatest thing to grace mankind but it's definitely a memorable, interesting, stylistic anime
the plot isn't _complicated,_ it's that certain elements of it are hidden from the audience and you have to do a little digging to understand precisely what's happening
otherwise you get an impression that isn't totally accurate or is missing certain details
and that's totally fine, most of those details are pretty needless
i'm not defending it, i'm exploring its qualities
yeah probably
like i said, it's not the greatest thing ever
maybe more accurate than saying "it's overhyped" is "its fans are fucking annoying"
what is japan's standing on homosexuality right now
so, why is japan less concerned with stuff like canonicity
what do they think of like.... people like us
who care very much about that
yes?
i care a lot about distinguishing between content that is or is not "official," it's just that that gets into a morass of confusion
even then there are some works that are pretty much unconcerned with canonicity

oh boy, is circumcision our next Hot Topic
lat you realize that circumcision is actually a required practice in judaism, right
can't believe i'm about to look this up
is webmd generally considered accurate or reliable enough
it seems that circumcision has the following benefits: lowered risk of urinary tract infections, STDs, penile cancer (and a lower risk of giving cervical cancer to female sex partners??? how the fuck?), prevents balanitis and balanoposthitis (inflammation problems) and prevention of phimosis/paraphimosis obviously
ah, there you go
yeah, there was a little footnote that said "it's easier to keep clean too" and i'm sure that's important
now
for the other side of things, it seems in rare cases due to surgical botching, circumcision can be associated with pain, bleeding, infection, irritation, inflammation
this seems to be a very low percentage thing though
i'm not willing to look up "what are the advantages of not being circumcised," someone else can do that research
fuck it, to incognito i go
```Significant complications are believed to occur in approximately one in 500 procedures.``` WHAT?
how the actual fuck is it that common
do you realize how many male babies are born a year
i'm not saying that the actual occurrence is surprising, i just feel like the description of "significant complication" warrants a little more explanation
```By one estimate, put forth by Dan Bollinger, a prominent opponent of circumcision, based on his review of infant mortality statistics, about 117 boys die each year as a result of circumcision. That estimate is cited often by critics of routine circumcision but widely disputed by medical professionals. A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the agency did not keep track of deaths from infant circumcision because they are exceedingly rare. In the agency‚Äôs last mortality report, which looked at all deaths in the country in 2010, no circumcision-related deaths were found.```
```The rate of procedure-related complications during and after circumcision in the neonate is approximately 2 to 6 per 1000```
this feels insanely high
what are the actual impacts that these complications have though, is what i'm asking
does it permanently harm them or is it just temporary illness or something
if it's the latter then it's less concerning
sure lat, that would make sense
the reason i'm surprised is that if 2-6 in 1000 males experienced permanent harm as a result of neonatal circumcisions, i'd expect the debate to be WAY more furious than it currently is
it must be temporary complications
wow it's almost like one of those things is an operation that's more or less routine in various cultures/parts of the world and the other is fetishistic at least half of the time
get the fuck outta heeeere
people can discuss SFW furry stuff just fine, it's when people start dragging shit like "i want to fuck this" that it becomes a problem
jokingly or not
or
no
i think jokes are okay too
but people are often bad at conveying it's a joke
if it's dry or sarcastic enough that it sounds genuine, then it's confusing
so we end up being a little discriminatory towards furry conversations because it's hard to distinguish when people are just joking or serious
see talking about fursuits is fine
talking about how you want to put a fuckhole in your fursuit = not fine
misha, settle down
this is dumb
im not sure he does, pretty sure he was just sassing us because we've yelled at him not to talk about making furry fetish jokes
we are never going to encourage hornyposting
i was enjoying the conversation about jewish culture too, why did it have to turn into this
i mean, the conversation about circumcision was also kind of interesting, insofar as hearing different people's perspectives on a controversial topic
this is just boring

 despite the subject matter, i actually really appreciate you linking this stanford medical article to me, it is EXTREMELY in-depth on the topic and that's the sort of explanation i like
like i said, i ahve no problem with people discussing furry stuff and it frequently happens in here anyway despite people complaining that it's actively persecuted or oppressed or whatever
people getting shut down over discussing arguably NSFW furry shit have no grounds to stand on

```Some political scientists define a civil war as having more than 1,000 casualties,[2] while others further specify that at least 100 must come from each side.[6] The Correlates of War, a dataset widely used by scholars of conflict, classifies civil wars as having over 1000 war-related casualties per year of conflict.```
```    That the Party in revolt against the de jure Government possesses an organized military force, an authority responsible for its acts, acting within a determinate territory and having the means of respecting and ensuring respect for the Convention.
    That the legal Government is obliged to have recourse to the regular military forces against insurgents organized as military and in possession of a part of the national territory.
    (a) That the de jure Government has recognized the insurgents as belligerents; or

(b) That it has claimed for itself the rights of a belligerent; or

(c) That it has accorded the insurgents recognition as belligerents for the purposes only of the present Convention; or

(d) That the dispute has been admitted to the agenda of the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations as being a threat to international peace, a breach of the peace, or an act of aggression.

    (a) That the insurgents have an organization purporting to have the characteristics of a State.

(b) That the insurgent civil authority exercises de facto authority over the population within a determinate portion of the national territory.

ah, yes
that one
god, i'm listening to fantasia and remembering all of the animations
we need to watch it sometime, even if just loosely
it's not really a stream movie in any sense but it's worth experiencing at least once
i enjoy very little about fantasia 2000 i'm afraid
i just like the little toys one and the one with animals
the rest of them are very meh
rhapsody in blue IS the animals one
you shithead
oh
wait, then what is the animal one i'm thinking of
carnival of animals apparently
yes
nevermind, let me rewatch that one
i don't think i agree with that
i feel as if NONE of the fantasia 2000 segments actually achieve their intended goal, which is to be as close to a perfect fusion of music and visuals as you can get
obviously that was their intention and you can see that in a lot of what's going on, the rhapsody in blue stuff is actually pretty decent
but i watched fantasia 2000 a few years ago and i was very disappointed with the way that it seems more... like...
focused on telling a story
instead of just doing that specific artistic style
and that's not to say that fantasia 1940 didn't have "stories" in it but there was so much more emphasis on the nature of music and how to tie it with visuals
no, the connection between music and visuals are much looser in basically every piece of 2000
i'm not saying this is BAD
i just don't think it fits with the spirit of fantasia as it was envisioned and what was done back in 1940
i will definitely put these on as a comparison if we do fantasia but i just do not feel like it fits the mould as well as it should
also firebird suite sucked as a climax to the movie
look
i want SOMETHING to hit visually with EVERY KEYSTROKE OF THE PIANO
there's like a loose association with the beat/rhythm of the song in most of these shots but the actual visceral connection between sound and visuals is just not there
compare this with literally the first piece of 1940, where it's not even concrete visuals it's just abstract imagery like blobs of color and shapes andn shit
and i enjoy that so much more
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6u-2NDsEgA
watch this nostalgic, i want you to see how closely associated the two senses are with each other
you SHIT STAIN
symphony 5 is much, _much_ closer to what i'm talking about yeah
but it's also just
not hitting sometimes
yes, i AM
because it's a much more faithful execution of the concept
it's not JUST animation, it's about synergy in visuals and audio
you can do that with live action too, it's just much harder
and the live action part of the toccata and fugue segment doesn't even last the entire time, it's just the beginning and end
watch the entire thing and see what i mean
i mean, regardless of whatever else, the symphony 5 is definitely much closer to what i'm talking about
it just doesn't feel like it hits right in a lot of respects
it may be that i just prefer the 1940 aesthetic but i feel like it does a better job of getting the syncopation down
what
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that's fucking incredible
okay, let me find an actual one
have it after the animation proper starts and it stops being live action i guess https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Img7Xn57c0
but man, like
1940 fantasia gives me chills almost _constantly_ all the way through the entire movie
i feel nothing with fantasia 2000, and i really wish i did
the beginning of the rhapsody in blue segment almost does it for me but not quite

ff7 is about an incel learning to love again after getting dumped by his hot gf who goes to live in the city, but then his new babe gets knifed and the incel becomes permanently blackpilled
in a way it's not terribly surprising
will this swell in nationalist tendencies worldwide go down naturally or will it resolve in fighting, do you guys think
what did he mean by this
makin, saying "we're objectively at the best point of human history comparatively speaking" might be true but does not eliminate the possibility of trying to take that away
it's all well and good to try and keep a broader perspective but the rise of nationalistic tendencies in various countries is not something to be overlooked
"it's just not going to happen" does not make me feel any better
okay whatever you fucking wacko
go back to your star wars and your computers
you can't just class an entire country as "being nationalist," it's a proportion of demographic engagement
you can look at a country and say "this is more or less nationalist than it was x years ago"
america right now is witnessing a significant rise in nationalism, overt or subtle, in a sizeable part of the population
i can't really speak to china but the stuff with the uighurs and hong kong are both extremely alarming
people like erdogan in turkey, macron in france, shinzo abe in japan, modi in india, variable success of far-right parties in places like germany, austria, italy, fucking duterte in the phillippines
i mean, it's possible trickster
it's difficult to tell how long it might take though
from the time of the first single-celled life to multicellular life, it took almost 2 billion years
after that it's another 2 billion for sentient life to appear
so our best guess is like 4 billion years for sentient life to reappear, at which point the sun will be nearing the end of its lifespan

what??
the crossing of the bering strait wasn't because it was formed out of _ice_
glaciation increased during the ice age and it caused water levels to drop, exposing beringia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_of_the_Americas#Emergence_and_submergence_of_Beringia
this is literally the foremost model of humans passing into the americas
get the fuck out of here
```A drop of eustatic sea level by about 60 to 120 metres (200 to 390 ft) from present-day levels, commencing around 30,000 years BP, created Beringia, a durable and extensive geographic feature connecting Siberia with Alaska.[13] With the rise of sea level after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Beringian land bridge was again submerged. ```
do you understand fucking english
misha are you just fucking with me right now
```During the Wisconsin glaciation, the Earth's ocean water was, to varying degrees over time, stored in glacier ice. As water accumulated in glaciers, the volume of water in the oceans correspondingly decreased, resulting in lowering of global sea level.```
I AM
LITERALLY
READING
IT
RIGHT
NOW
YOU FUCKING MORON
IT SAYS THAT THE SEA LEVELS DROPPED BECAUSE OF AN INCREASE IN GLACIATION
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SEA LEVELS RISE AND DROP WITH RELATION TO HOW MUCH ICE IS IN THE WORLD
THIS IS NOT SAYING THAT THE BERING STRAIT WAS FORMED FROM ICE
IT'S SAYING THAT THERE WERE MORE GLACIERS SO THAT SEA LEVELS DROPPED AND EXPOSED MORE LAND
THAT'S LITERALLY HOW IT WORKS
MISHA YOU FUCKING RETARD
I'M FUCKING SEETHING
NO, IT WASN'T

THE MODERN SEABED WAS EXPOSED DURING PERIODS OF HIGH GLACIATION

WHERE PEOPLE COULD WALK
people didn't walk across a fucking ice shelf that would be moronic
MISHA
BOTH THE YELLOW AND RED ARROWS GO ACROSS EXPOSED LAND
because it would take too long
the whole point of it being a LAND BRIDGE is that stuff managed to grow on it like basic plants
no
the land bridge was NOT coveredi n snow, at least not perpetually
an ice shelf cannot support life
the land bridge was able to grow plants on it, which supported the presence of animals
humans needed animals to cross into the americas or they would ahve starved en route
that's the entire point of calling it a land bridge
nomads bring animals but BERINGIA WAS NOT AN ICE SHEET
misha if you continue to bait on this i'll fucking kill you

that's what i was talking about with plants and animals
i'm just thinking about the difference in domesticable animals between eurasia and the americas
in the eurasian supercontinent there's something like 30+ animals that humans were able to domesticate
in the american supercontinent, there were only 2
llamas and dogs
if the early nomads had been more effective at bringing livestock over, i wonder how that might have changed things
horses, cattle, pigs, chickens, donkeys

yeah we were tired of debating whether the bering strait was made of ice or land, so we bypassed it completely by making a wormhole to the other side

i have notes for two entries but the will to write just isn't there
i dunno, just can't motivate myself to get into it
everything feels kind of pointlessly hashed out already
no motivation
i want to keep a record of this place going but the energy doesn't exist
and i don't feel like any of the things i observe are particularly worthy of writing down, even though stuff is different all the time
interdasting
how to detox dopamine
i asked how not what
i don't do anything exciting
what must i do
that video didn't need to be 15 minutes long
also to be honest it seems kind of simpistic
simplistic, not simpistic
vastly different things
anyway, i think any buffoon with even a remedial knowledge of biology could come to the conclusion that limiting your intake of a high-reward substance or activity will reset your enjoyment of it
that's not what's in question
the difficulty is in being able to establish those habits in the first place
no, what i mean is that i have no desire
I HAVE NOT LUSTED
anyway i'm not going to drag my sad sack issues in here
go back to your farscapes and your among uses and your wieners

what are you all discussing suddenly

nothing
i'm just tired and losing my mind
no fun
forget it
please do then report back
i want to see that

i'm not sleepy tired i'm ANGSTY TIRED

matey
twitter fucking sucks, wipe your feet before you step in here
what the god damn shit fuck?
where do you get that idea exactly
yeah i'm not paying 100% attention but i'm still fucking flabbergasted by this conversation
GIVE US THE RECEIPTS
how the fuck are you talking about in terms of "should be"
there is no "should be"
there is only what is
and yet they clearly do
i usually hate to talk like this because it feels really divisive and mean, or non-inclusive, but do you guys ever get the feeling that some people just rapidly and uncontrollably accelerate their philosophical discourse to the point that it stops resembling anything close to the reality that most other people experience
i'm talking about gender politics
no, i'm not going to proselytize or say "THIS IS INVALID"
i'm not here to do that
i just want to bring up that anecdote from in mod chat, where cy had to teach us about what the fuck "truscum" is because like five of us had precisely zero clue
and then she ended up using "transmedicalist" and finally "bioessentialist" before we finally understood
what i'm getting at is that people who regularly engage in gender political discourse are inhabiting a sphere that's very particular to them, and as an outsider i feel obligated to point out that knowledge of these things is nowhere near as ubiquitous as they seem to believe
yes
in the process of explaining this to us cy literally said "i didn't realize most people just don't _know_ this stuff"
i _also_ want to point out that the sphere of gender politics is not monolithic, it's splintered into thousands of different schools of thought or particular leanings
so making it out that cis people are idiots who don't know this stuff kind of sweeps away the fact that everyone seems to believe at least slightly different things about how this should all work
it's fucking _confusing_
yeah i'm not really surprised by that lat, people's understanding of this stuff evolves so quickly that it seems everyone has at least slightly different opinions by the next _month_
no shit doctors wouldn't be aware of everything
oh boy, here we go
does anyone want some popcorn
i give it a 1 in 5 chance mint

<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
i'm fucking losing it dude
it's been a LONG time since we saw a metadebate in here
it's revitalizing my chakras
<@!193814482420498432> i'm having a laugh at the conversation's expense but don't just randomly shitpost in the middle of a discussion, ridiculous or not
interesting tabs, "big bang" essay on google docs and a tab that said "comparing heights"
<@!267823431444070402> fans pigshit
OH FUCK
THAT WASN'T A USER WHEN I CHECKED
<@!267823431444070402> sorry for the ping, please ignore this channel and enjoy your day
now that i think about it "pickleOnlooker" is probably from april fool's day 2019 so that user is probably dead
is it too late to go back to discussing medical professional standards or have we all mutually moved on from that conversation
fucking christ, i'm still amazed at that turnaround
like two lines of discourse and then META DEBATE for fifteen minutes
i kind of do but i also have to point out my distinct lack of knowledge or experience
i am not trans and i highly doubt i will ever identify as trans, and even though i've received some education in anatomy and physiology i'm not really a professional in that area
yeah that's common enough andrew
doctors have the choice to refuse elective surgeries if they think it'll be unethical or dangerous or whatever else
i think sterilizations are considered elective
doctors often reject requests for sterilization before a certain age or number of children had, or without certain precautions
yeah what krato said
yeah, that's a dead ringer for being rejected
it sucks because prevailing logic among people our age says it should be a personal choice
but i kind of agree with that decision, in the sense that people that age have a looong way to go in their lives, and sterilization is kind of a heavy process that's hard to reverse and can lead to permanent changes
go to BED nat
you SHIT
i _absolutely_ disagree with that
people should not be taking hormones on their own accord, that's fucking ludicrous
>sugar is a drug
<:spongebobFishYouWhat:669659253111390208>
i mean, strictly speaking lat would be correct in terms of stuff like heart disease
but presenting it like that is extremely disingenuous
sugar is a carbohydrate that's relatively ubiquitous in nature and is 100% critical to homeostasis/energy production
your body literally requires sugars in order to manufacture ATP
classifying it as a drug is insane, but advocating for less rampant consumption of it is fine
you're conflating two different pieces of the same argument
why do you always do this
ironically, embarrassing anti-vaxxers by demonstrating that people don't take them seriously is probably a much more persuasive and effective tool than actually telling them any real facts
people suck like that
we need to weaponize information and find an efficient way to curtail anti-science people, even if it's not '""""the right way"""" to do it
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
you mean those like
i'm thinking of stuff like "egg_irl" but not memey
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
i don't know i think andrew's point is pretty okay
he's saying that what society accepts as men have much looser restrictions on how to appear in public
i don't think that's a particularly controversial point

i just got up and played catch with my equally depressed dog mocha and i think both of us feel a little better
she's such a good doggo
it's just hard cuz mocha's like over a dozen years old and was never really My Dog
i just take care of her now as she gets old
it's hard not to develop a bond with animals though
after she passes away, i think i might break my No Pets rule and get a ppuppy
maybe
absolutely not, i do not prefer cats at all

i'm in my pajamas what do you want
thanks andrew that's clearly the thing i wanted to get across in this photo of my dog

she's seen a lot, she was a rescue
apparently quite an abusive household before she came to us
i'm teaching her to open up again, it's been somewhat successful

got any pictures of cheezoid tipsy
cheezoid looks a lot like our cat ace
i hate ace though, he's a fucking grubby motherfucker
animals can be so wonderful
that twinkle in the boy's eye
SNAGGLE TOOTH
LET THEM IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
nice broken screen
the hallmark of any midwestern household
you might have noticed all the broken as fuck tiles and bare floor in my photos too
this is how you know we share a geographical region
add one more to the list
her actual name is "Baby Girl" but she's called "BG" (bee-gee) for short, and we call her beeger for short
pronounced "bee-jur"
<:bred:684981349311971339>
not my dog, it's dero's and her fiancee's
we have a different even better picture of her but i think it's lost to time
beeg is 16 years old
she's showing her age more and more, but she still has a lot of fight left
she's very precious
yeah, and i look like fucking santa claus
very dignified doggo
wait a minute
+progress
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> so that's why it works
i didn't realize that progress and pogress were actually different commands
the little icon changes in each one though, that's fucking wonderful
props to whoever coded that bot
perfection, truly
wackiest is such a quality emote
explain your lamentations, oh mythical and legendary one
nothing
in fact i'm writing up the spat entries including last night and today
playing fetch with mocha and talking with chat today helped remind me a bit of why i was doing it
2 find out, read the spat ??  ?? ??
that's right mofucka
spat entries written
not the best, but they're there
not sure if i should bother with putting these up after makin looks at them, or if i should compile more before doing an update
was the last entry actually a month ago
spat has gradually changed
i don't feel as if i have room for dissection of how our culture _works_ anymore, it's just a description of what that culture is and what it consists of as time goes by
which is fine, but it feels less substantive to me as a result
now i just feel like i'm saying the same things with different words a lot of the time
"this user is like this," "this meme comes from here"
stuff like that
when i can
i do not have a fursona
someone would have to make it first
i guess
it's hard to feel like any of it is interesting after a while though
that's overly simplistic
i can hate like 90% of a thing but if that 10% i did like was SUPER FUCKING GOOD i'm going to be fond of that part and lament the rest
like, "this could have been so good, what happened"
YOUR ABSOLUTIST RHETORIC WILL NOT SERVE YOU HERE

i have not laughed as hard at something as i have at goatkcd in many, many years

all of connor's edits are bad
thank god someone downloaded the original supercut
i don't remember if i still have it but i'm pretty sure it's on youtube
i think the creator is trying to get back into making episodes
or not khonjin but supermental
this one is still a personal favorite https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQJZTWBPxNM
oh man, did he take down the advertisement one
where he was saying "buy my shirts for christmas" and then got on a helicopter
i really liked that one
that one is also fucking great
god
there's so much to love about khonjin house, it's such masterful editing, but connor lagherty is a fucking weird and tragic human being

this is not where political discourse should be, ever, especially not right now

virtue signaling was kind of muddied as a concept because it's harder to apply to individual people
with big entities though it becomes exceedingly obvious
no i'm not saying you can't apply it to individuals
i'm just saying it's hard to ascribe someone's motives if they're just one person
like, who are you to say whether virtue signaling is their goal or not, it almost has to be spelled out
or at least, i'm just reticent to do so
i've never been fond of pointing at someone and claiming they're just going "SEE HOW MUCH I CARE"
wat
yeah
<a:aSithHusky:668208374827057174>
god
i tried
i tried monster hunter world and i just couldn't get into it
i really want to enjoy it
but i can't stand the way it feels
there's plenty of people here who have, but i don't know if the Halo Crowd is on right now
it's usually later in the day
i finished higurashi last night and now i don't even know what to do with my time
no no no no no no no no no no
i mean, maybe it is, but it's even longer
i can't do another VN right now
yes iconoclasts i know
i know
i mean, what even is it
okay, but you thought hollow knight was meh but i loved that game so much i 100%ed it
i generally try to give anything at least one chance
okay, good point
you seemed displeased with it though, from what i recall
or maybe you were just pushing back against it being overhyped
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
no, i was explicitly thinking about tensei talking about it after he beat it
it's been a while so i forgot what the details were
either way, i'll give iconoclasts a shot here
what's cooler
oh fuck i should also try disco elysium again
i think playing higu improved my focus just al ittle bit
yeah it won't be for a bit
gotta take a break from VN structure
what's up dero
maybe yeah, if we can like
find a way to actually advance in the plot
i got really fed up with that game because it felt like us wandering around aimlessly and that nothing was getting done
if we can actually figure out how to MOVE FORWARD then count me in

god, i can feel my life wasting AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
trapped in my cycles of shitty fucking internet
tensei i already have a home workout routine
... so
what's the point
how do you make progress
is it just like a fucking source game
where you endlessly do stuff just for fun
if that's the case then so be it, i just thought it had real progression to it
oh yeah, speaking of pretty good story
higurashi took me an absurd amount of time to actually get into, but i'm actually really glad that i stuck with it and finished it
it's almost too big though, i can't wrap my appraisal around it for people who haven't experienced it
i will say though that when the game finally ended and the title screen came up again i got hit by an enormous wave of frisson
that's the shit i _crave_
yeah no
fuck that
but hearing that umineko is similar but better is definitely enticing me to play it sometime
it'll just have to be a while
VNs are a fucking undertaking
are all VNs this long or what
ooh, even better
i'll try not to put it off indefinitely
also, misha notified me that they're doing like a remake of the anime later this year
i alraedy want to watch the OG higu anime with him and mint because it sounds fucking terrible
and i want to compare it with the VN, and also decompress
yeah i don't know shit about umineko
what, you didn't even get frisson in rdr2 ||at the end of arthur's portion of the game?||
that shit still gives me chills just thinking about it
frisson is basically getting a chill up your spine, in a good way
it's basically a shortcut to my "this is good" button
but i've learned to balance it out with... actual critical understanding
generally if something is able to give me frisson though, it hits on something that i really like
usually that's something to do with scope
that's definitely a good one
that came out so long ago though
that's crazy to me
it's like an enormous culmination of stuff
maybe i'm just more susceptible to things, i don't know
i'm GULLIBLE
not at all makin
ever17 just made me feel irritated most of the time
the twist almost justified it, at least
companies can do stock buybacks to regain control over themselves but it becomes very costly
jesus it feels so weird to be playing like an actual video game after doing a VN for so long
the meme is whataburger vs in n out
in n out is a burger chain on the west coast and i think whataburger is more southern midwest
sure mines
but the thing is
i've had in n out
i didn't like their fries at all, they were like eating potato strings
i haven't had whataburger yet
so it has a chance
five guys is overpriced as hell but they kind of make up for it by giving you a metric fuck ton of fries
however, i can't give it points for that because often enough their fries are hit and miss
like, sometimes you get really good, really fresh and crispy fries
other times you get a soggy, undercooked mess
katt
i can only hope so
speaking of which time to listen to castlevania octagon remix
gnawms, iconoclasts is pretty okay so far
i actually find myself not enjoying it as much for the opposite reason you argued against hollow knight
i find myself not caring nearly as much about what's going on even though
it's
given to you pretty straightforwardly
and it doesn't harp on the stuff/lore so much
because my internet is too poor for farscape and this game is pretty fun
i'll be playing more iconoclasts in a bit <@!173936231229554688> so far i'm enjoying it plenty
the fuck does that even mean

yeah i'm bored tonight, back to iconoclasts
sorry qweq, i belong to the fraternity of glaukos and achelous
no
this song is pretty good qweq
i enjoy it a lot
i don't know, i was just being snarky because i have done something that is really unusual for me
going trout fishing and catching/cleaning my own food has been a really humbling experience
i've often talked about greek mythology and other paganist systems of belief as a way of paying respect to the universe, and the fact that i really like that idea
so, i took it upon myself to make a little shrine for glaukos, the god of fishermen, and achelous, the god of freshwater so i can say thanks to the universe
got a little incense burner and put some frankincense in there, filled a couple of bowls with sea salt for glaukos and clean freshwater for achelous
i plan on burning a stick of incense before and after every trip to go trout fishing for good luck
shut up you are trash i will hunt you down
yep, my greekaboo is really coming out moon
<@!207991389613457408> i would love to, but i don't have access to any of those animals or the tools to do it, and i would probably fuck it up real bad
maybe i should go work for a butchery
you romaboos are just self-conscious because the empire stole all of its beliefs from other people instead of making their own
get an original culture you fucking HACKS
CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE BASED CRINGE IS THAT ALL YOU SHITPOSTING _FUCKS_ CAN SAY

i wonder how much it would cost to get fake accoutns to come and talk here
isnt it something like a hundred bucks for a thousand accounts on twitter or something
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> not even close
it costs less than tree fiddy for 1000 twitter followers
https://hypeauditor.com/blog/instagram-fraud-how-much-are-fake-followers-likes-and-comments/
instagram seems rather pricy by comparison, nearly 50 bucks for 1000 random comments
man, i'll have whatever this guy's having
i wish i could believe that strongly in utter bullshit
uh, i was making a joke
since when have i ever actually indulged in that kind of thinking
i say as someone drags up a list
i can just tell i'm not going to like what you say
how do we get more euros in here
i guess they're just generally smarter than we are, and have given up on homestuck faster
you're welcome
i haven't heard that since i was in fucking middle school
i wish i could find an image that conveys exactly how it made me feel

inside every mod is an absolute hawg, just waiting to be released
okay, i have to share this
in order to find that image i google image searched "dead inside reaction images"
i was scrolling down just to see what most of these look like and predictably most are complete trash
but then out of nowhere i see this

how on earth does this exist
i think the sheer absurdity of this image broke something inside of me
just reunited with her brother
i'll play more tomorrow

oh yeah i wasn't able to check out that trailer before
let me find it
hm
this game looks like it could have great potential
but if it's the disney infinity people i'm more with mines
there's a LOT that could go wrong, especially for a game like this
i will say that it's an excellent idea to have it set an entire century before the events of harry potter
that way we don't have to worry about a bunch of bullshit
give us an original plotline
i gotta admit too, it's hard not to be a little excited
this is something people have wanted for years
is this before or after hogwarts invented plumbing so that the students could stop shitting themselves
i don't know tensei
like, jk rowling being a dummy trying to pick a fight with progressives is whatever
but the kind of lore she's retroactively inserting into her own property is really not good
do you want a mechanic where you regularly shit yourself and you have to use a spell to remove it

or even better, /r/comedynecrophilia
even just the name of that second subreddit makes me laugh
it's like a preamble to truly terrible things
tarty how do you know so much about these conflicts
how does a person like that get in a position like so
i was just talking with my gf about this kind of thing today
i think i'm fortunate to be in a group like this where i'm not exposed to this kind of thing
it always baffles me when i see it but she's just like "yep, those exist"
still awful
you guys left out the best part of that screenshot
the profile picture and page banner are fucking _wild_
it's not the worst thing i've ever seen but it's up there
everyone gonna die
DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATH

YOU DISPLEASE ME WITH YOUR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF OUR CUSTOMS
YOU WILL BE DISPOSED OF
SACRIFICE
WAIT
shit
i actually don't have the altgenner of the week role anymore
i don't know what to do
should we just ban the guy
<@!757720542798151711> BAN
FUCK
there's no altgen specific ban role either
this is fucking RIDICULOUS
THIS SACRIFICE IS BULLSHIT
KILL
I'M STILL ANGRY SO WE'RE STILL SACRIFICING UNTIL I FIGURE OUT A MEANINGFUL WAY TO CONCLUDE THIS

KILL
DEATH
THE SACRIFICE HAS PLEASED ME
I HAVE DECIDED TO INCITE A _NEW_ TRADITION
AS A SACRIFICE BRINGS US TOGETHER, SO TOO DOES IT REWARD US
AND OUR REWARD SHALL BE
üçû
I HAVE CONVERTED THE ALTGENNER OF THE DECADE ROLE INTO BREAD
AND I WILL DISPENSE IT UPON ALL WHO HAVE GATHERED HERE TONIGHT
and then it's getting deleted at some point so enjoy it while it lasts you fuckign simps
BREAD
bread has been dispensed to all, enjoy your carbohydrates and be excellent to each other
first sacrifice in quite some time, and i feel satisfied with it
the great bredening of 2020
<@!207991389613457408> if nothing else, i'm sure there's at least one couple who _tried_
but let us not discuss this anymore
why are you doing this to me
üßÄ
ONE MINUTE REMAINS
ENOUGH
this was a delightful way to retire the altgenner of the decade role
it was a great night, thanks for participating
but enough spam for today
when time resumes, do regular shitposting instead of shitspam
or else üó°Ô∏è
it felt good to bring that back, even if only for one night
wait is that THE ENTIRE THING zupah
how did you even do this <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
nah, sorry
we decided to get rid of all meme/vanity roles today because they're stinking up our list
so i just wanted sacrifices to go out with a bang
it was worth it
<@!280133422343651330> if you have a full one somehow i'd staple it in here
otherwise this one is good too
lmao
alright that's fair
<@!156922195631669249> clear some room on the fucking pin list
wait, do you guys not like archive pins in here
the fuck is that shit
where is your _history_ going
oh my god thank goodness
i knew i kept altgen around for a reason
the monkes need sustenance every now and then
but only enough to make them more angery
soon, arabia
you will not know when the time comes, but soon
hurry up so i can pin the megascreenshot

temporary
it'll be deleted later tonight
enjoy it while it lasts
yeah it's just for fun
i used to do sacrifices more or less weekly in altgen but retired them
now i'm getting rid of the role too
just has to be done
we literally just scream "SACRIFICE" "BLOOD" "KILL" and an assortment of random stuff, especially "BREAD"
which is a shitler thing
after some time of this spam, i freeze the channel and designate a sacrifice
that sacrifice historically was given a role to commemorate the occasion, called "Altgenner of the Week"
when i retired sacrifices i turned it to Altgenner of the Decade and gave it to everyone who participated that night
i did a similar thing this time, and since we're deleting the meme/vanity roles tonight i decided to give it nice outro with a final sacrifice
no problem faeby, glad you enjoyed it
also sorry but i'm gonna pass on the among us for tonight
feeling kind of tired, but i appreciate the invitation, sincerely
also you know what schmonkey i think so
oof in the chat
you're listed on the server staff shroom
yeah, it's in the introduction
now that you mention it though, it would probably be better served as its own page
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
thanks for the suggestion shroom, i'll do that tomorrow when i'm free
for tonight just gonna write this entry
reti you can't just wish to be big
the size fairies don't work that way
you need to sweat and toil for it
you bitch
i'm sure sacrifices will come back at some point in the future for fun
but it will be a long while
they must be at least vaguely aware of it, for why else would they try so hard to elude death's inevitable grasp


no i just have no life lol
_takes drag from cigar_
nah son i just been here a while
never forget
silence, creature
no probably not
i mean, at least not during the day
in the afternoon maybe
it really just depends nostalgo
i don't really have an efficient way to demarcate Important Events in SPAT besides reading through it myself and noting specificp ages
i have no desire to do that though
too many words
that looks almost dangerous
i like the texturing
ah
that reminds me, i have a few pictures i took today while hiking that i want to share
we had brought food for a picnic and by chance noticed two stickbugs fucking each other nearby
i tried to pick them up with a real stick to get a picture of them mid-coitus but one of them started crawling on my hand and it scared the shit out of me, so i only got one
pictures uploading, sorry
internet 2 shitty 4 me

this guy literally tried to take a shit on me and missed
the other one was smaller and green, i feel bad that i interrupted them and didn't even get a good picture for the trouble
here's a picture of the vista from on top of a hill the trail went on

that one actually reminds me that i was out the other day and there wasn't a cloud in the sky, but the fires from california were still sending smoke our fucking way
so i got a picture of this fat fucking haze

the wildfires are fucking 1,700 miles away from me
what is project winter again
god, that's gonna take me fucking forever to download
my ass
get this van darkholme shit off my SCREEN
yeah gnawms, not a lot but i beat the uh
tunneling boss in the forest
it was a nicely designed fight
yeah
yeah, it was a good way to utilize your toolset
massive points to the devs for making inventive boss fights that actually make good use of your weaponry
that's impressive shit
hatred is like a giant grouping of people
all it takes is a single match to light the blaze of fury

i've managed to keep CAD out of myl ife thus far, why would i include it more
definitely
<@!137125582994538496> just fixed a minor error near the bottom but everything else looks solid to me
i wouldn't change the tone but i also kind of hate what viz has been doing, so a more neutral mind may be needed
also you might consider turning new reader mode on by default
you just know there's gonna be dipshits who don't read the intro
yeah exactly
i know from _experience_
woc i think you need medical help
that's how they get you tm
literally every single person trying to seduce you just wants to sink the knife in
it's weird how some events can feel like they happened a lot farther back than they actually did, and others feel a lot more recent
what was it we were talking about the other day that was 2 years old
yes, thank you tm
bowsette was two whole years ago, isn't that nuts
TWO
YEARS

shoutout to halo 2
god, where does the time go
this world is cruel

oh boy, time to check this context
what are you pinging both people for
i can't remember what this looks like and it's already making me scowl, so it must be good
ah yes, it's this one
now i remember why it made me scowl
apparently not
i get done with a long ass day of painting the inside of a house and this is what i'm greeted with
no place like home i guess
taste the pain!
ooh, frittata!
now _that's_ the spice
my left arm hurts after all the paint rolling
did like two bedrooms and two closets from top to bottom
OH GOD I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK
what would you guys do if i just never talked again after saying that
"the evil is dead"
i think about that sometimes mines
like if i was about to have an emergency while i was talking on here, would i say anything about it
or would i just leave you all to wonder
cuz i mean, i lived completely by myself for three years
dude dero is like my best fucking friend
and also my sibling
no it's not, dero is the fucking best
get outta here
dude if i die i'm passing the server to dero
it's in my will
<a:blair:424571787372658708>
i wasn't joking about a will, by the way
i was joking about having it go to dero
but i have a flash drive i keep on my person with a file called "in case of my death"
where i lay out basic stipulations since i don't know how to write a proper will and i can't really have it notorized
my desktop computer and laptop go to dero, the server reverts to makin, and i make sure that dero informs this channel about my passing
that's basically it
i have a copy of that file on a second flash drive i keep in my filing cabinet
i guess there's nothing stopping me from printing it out and taking it to a notary
it's just kind of lame
"is this really all you stipulated in your will? some dinky internet community is to be told you died?"
"why did you bring this to me?"
"do you need psychiatric help?
that would be just my luck
bet they'd ask to take a selfie and post it here
that would be kind of fun actually
"form a secret society in my honor: i require that you create a small estate with a hidden basement that serves as a gathering chamber, but instead of doing anything nefarious i just want you all to hang out sometimes and have a nice time"
"watch some movies, you know, the whole shebang"
"i have also included in this document a final SPAT entry i had prepared in the case of my death. it follows:

`It was a dark and stormy night. In her attic bedroom Margaret Murry, wrapped in a patchwork quilt,`"
yeah i'm hiding in the dinosaur land at the center of the earth
i just wanted to stop being the admin of this fucking server so bad that i faked my own death
i have four entries, but i feel like accumulating more before i put anything out
i hate this topic
can we go back to talking about me being dead
finally
catch you all later
hold on let me resurrect myself
shhhhhFWOOP
I'M ALIVE
I'M _BORN_
IS THIS WHAT AIR TASTES LIKE?
I DON'T LIKE IT
PUT ME _BACK_
but no what do you mean
oh
it just takes work
the thing is that it takes more and more work the deeper you get into it
what level chem class is it
nah that's a pretty significant barrier of entry for most people, don't feel bad
i actually got a B in gen chem I and one of my only two Cs in gen chem II and i loved chemistry
so really, you're probably doing okay
the other C was in org chem II so go figure
put it in my pocket
everything is better with a fisheye lens
god, just get out you fucking normie

i hate my name color now, so bright
make some room
<@!266807632390520833> sorry i wasn't here today, i was busy basically from the moment i woke up to getting home a couple hours ago
wallace and gromit possible tomorrow
we'll see
`HURTS A LITTLE`
no wait i wanted to keep reading that
ah, the original editor left the company before the black bomber had a chance to be printed, thank goodness
no custom settings and stuff
okay, what else you got
when are we watching creating rem lezar
someone in the background whispers "halloween"
you got it, guy in the background
go for it
why not
terrible
do you have like boba tea places around there
i've been enjoying that more often lately
especially taro
why does that mean i simp for it
i just said i liked taro boba tea
which isn't even true i just like taro smoothies
nat is being irrational
you say that
i'll be over here enjoying my drink
WHAT
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ADDING CHOCOLATE POWDER TO COCA COLA
is this like unsweetened cocoa or
dude, nat is fucking nesquicking her soda
it's just a giant middlefinger--WHAT
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE MIDDLEFINGER
HOW MUCH COCOA POWDER DID YOU ADD
<:NotLikeThis:507285193988767744>
nat is deliberately trying to replace the blood in her body with fucking sugar
you're going to get diabeetus
I'm stuck on the highway because they're moving an entire house into the road for transport
This is a great start to the day
this is asinine
but why this
we got rid of the vanity roles
because it was unfair to regular users
woc has gaming pseudo, pseudo-mod and janitor roles are all basically custom roles by dint of being unique so we allow that to happen
mods and admin don't get them
i don't want to talk about this
i floated that idea and no one on the mod team cared about the idea, and some were opposed to it outright
wheals has discovered the secret
he must be stopped
maybe it's time i reread tgt
i got kind of burned out when i caught up so i didn't keep up with it
"wanton endangerment of the first degree"
quite a step down from homicide
they didn't even have the right house
they were executing a no knock warrant for someone who lived in a different part of the city, who they already had in jail
two brain cells is about right
it's not that it's codified as being legal, it's that there's no law on the books about it so they wouldn't be able to be charged for it i think
don't take what i said for granted though, i could be wrong
i've heard what you're talking about but i'm not an expert obviously
```Officers Myles Cosgrove and Jonathan Mattingly were not indicted. Cameron said their actions the night Taylor died were justified after Kenneth Walker, Taylor's boyfriend, fired first.

    "Our investigation found that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker," Cameron said.```
oh boy
people aren't going to like this
apparently "wanton endangerment first degree" carries a penalty of up to five years in prison per count, but i doubt it would be the full penalty in this case either
it never is for police officers
yeah, but the situation in its entirety was a fuck up of the highest order
there should be SOME kind of reprimanding for it
yeah this is breonna taylor
yeah, we're in agreeance with you
no knock warrants are unacceptable
the distinction we're arguing now is whether what they did is judiciable
which doesn't rely on moral grounds, it's about statutory grounds
as reprehensible as it is, the internal investigation found they did things according to procedure
the morality of it has to be pushed to the side because they're not accepting arguments based on morality
i don't think this was done to code because, as i said before, the no-knock warrant was performed at _the wrong house_ for someone who was _already in jail_
so it was completely needless and resulted in the loss of an innocent life
this should be a slam dunk for malfeasance of some kind but the cops responsible will probably get nothing
yeah the attorney general actually said something to this effect
```"This is a tragedy. And sometimes, the criminal law is not adequate to respond to a tragedy. And I fully acknowledge that and I know many that are watching today and those listening recognize that as well," Cameron said. "But the response is that the grand jury was given all of the evidence, presented all the information, and ultimately, made the determination that Detective [Brett] Hankison was the one to be indicted."```
this isn't particularly placating though
because if it wasn't for the enormous amount of media attention breonna taylor's case was getting, or the nationwide protests, they would never have gotten even _this_ far
it smacks of people who wanted to avoid dealing with this in any way and are irritated that they're being forced to reckon with it
```Cameron also announced that he was creating "a task force to review the process for securing securing and executing search warrants in Kentucky." Members of the public, law enforcement, elected officials, defense attorneys and representatives from the judiciary will be included in the task force, he said.

"I believe having a top-to-bottom review of the search warrant process is necessary to determine if changes are required and establish the best practices," he said.```
this is something, but i guarantee it'll come to nothing all the same
<@!108778093631533056> it's not a a claim that nothing will ever change, more so that we've seen this process before and that's typically what happens in this kind of scenario
believe me, i would love to be proven wrong
but i'll believe it when i see it
```Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said his office determined the police officers knocked and announced their presence at Breonna Taylor‚Äôs home when she was killed.

That determination was made based on statements by other officers who were present at the location, and that information was corroborated by another civilian witness who was nearby at the time, he said.

Some background: Taylor was killed in March. The officers broke down the door to her apartment while executing a late-night, "no-knock" warrant in a narcotics investigation on March 13.```
<a:THINKCEPTION:492742434665529377>
well, nobody's leaving right now anyway
cuz of the 'rona
yeah that makes no sense
firing a gun is scary at first but you get used to it quickly enough
using it in self-defense is another matter entirely
but i recommend going to a gun range and trying out a small firearm, such as a pistol or a revolver
it really helped me get over my anxiety of handling firearms
what CAN you get
not... universally??
not everyone has access to a .22
<:cerberusHusky:757290465132281907>
how do you know something is true art?
it just looks like this: <:robotass:752311525699485717>
i really like the original series of gundam but it took a lot of work to get there
i honestly feel like the very ending of it is entirely transformative
like, i was pretty confidently meh on all of it right up to the part where the special children, whatever they're called, end up talking to each other through telepathy
and i don't quite recall how or why, but that kind of unlocked it for me
yes
there was some dialogue that they had with each other that was some acknowledgment of where humans were now and where they might be in the future
it gave me chills and i was immediately like "holy shit, this almost retroactively improves the entire series for me"
as opposed to a vile drink made of coca cola with nesquik on top
not even mixed in
which would be bad enough on its own
but just PILED ON TOP OF THE DRINK
LIKE SOME KIND OF BARBARIAN
you're the rap
fine, fine
you know, right now wouldn't be a bad time for wallace and gromit depending on who's available
<@&693935623966425219> let's try this again: <:greentick:567088336166977536> if you can watch wallace and gromit this afternoon, presumably within the next hour to an hour and a half, <:no:524370222023442442> if you can't
yes
it's in my blood
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
fucking euros
why not tomorrow around 1-2 PM EST
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
isn't the theatrical cut the one with the horrible voice over
it ruins the entire fucking movie
no
well, maybe
hold on
it's hard trying to remember which of the 17 cuts is which
yeah woc the final cut is the one where deckard is a replicant because ridley had full control over that one
the director's cut is the best version of the film because it underplays the unicorn shit and doesn't have a voice over
oh no
<@!273994148825268224> yes
it has those things, and it does it in a way that's much more watchable than the original
but it's not quite as stylistic and the visuals are less... impressive, in a way
read worm is no longer the true meme
that's outdated
wtc is the more common choice these days
it's boopin'
you moderated the undertale discord
no one wants to be you, ever
eh, got me there
anyway, starting iconoclasts back up i think
it's a double rainbow
what the fuck kind of peanut butter are _you_ talking about
peanut butter is ubiquitous in america and probably other places
PB&J is such a common sandwich that it's practically engrained in the common consciousness of every american
yeah i only had peanut butter sandwiches
and it ruined peanut butter for me
you have one every single day of your public school life, it gets pretty old
just kill your immune response system
ez fix
man, this shit with the police officers being charged over breonna taylor's killing
it just seems to be escalating
apparently two officers have already been shot in louisville
and that was three hours ago almost, probably more shit has happened since then
how was the protest
damn
that's pretty cool
or, well
it's not "cool," it's pretty sad that people are being pushed in the direction of needing to protest again
but it's good that there are people being interested
i'm watching a bunch of livefeeds of the protests in louisville
it looks really chaotic
lots of police units out, people screaming
apparently pepperballs, mace, tear gas all being used
pretty scary stuff
https://www.twitch.tv/woke
ignore the shitty thumbnail
this has a bunch of thumbnails up at all times, with audio switching between various videos
people are _pissed_
yeah
i wonder how well american protestors are adapting to those things
like, hong kong protestors went all out and were pretty ingenious when it came to overcoming or frustrating various police measures
i don't know if i've seen the same level of adaptation or strategy here
well
this stuff is kind of complicated, we were talking about it before
to steer it into talking more about the rhetoric behind protesting versus not protesting, it's like
you can argue about it from a legal perspective, saying that the officers involved followed the law on paper and so they're not really culpable aside from what the grand jury decided today
but to anyone with eyes, that reasoning seems pretty hollow
first, in similar incidents it's pretty rote standard for officers to lie after the fact and claim they knocked (nonsensical given that they specifically requested a no-knock warrant)
and all of the circumstances surrounding the officers' actions indicates that they fucked up, _hard_
i don't know if i would be out there protesting and shouting and stuff like that, i definitely wouldn't be one of the people gunning for cops
but when a completely innocent person is shot while sleeping in her own bed because of police malfeasance, it's like
i'm not surprised
not surprised at all
to be clear, i literally mean "gunning" as in shooting them in the streets
i definitely think the cops should be prosecuted to a fuller extent than they were
and i think the protests are a logical, valid conclusion to the kind of violence being employed against the people
if i lived closer to the city i probably would be participating in the local protests actually
i almost went out back in the initial wave of protests, but it was also at the height of coronavirus spread back in june
not really
or, well
maybe it is
i don't exactly have my finger on the pulse of urban america
i'm living an hour and a half away, completely isolated from that stuff
she was an EMT in louisville who was sleeping in her apartment at night, while the police initiated a no-knock raid
they didn't announce themselves (they claim they did but probably didn't), taylor's boyfriend fired a handgun at them thinking they were burglars
the cops shot back and killed taylor while she was in bed
the grand jury today responsible for issuing recommendations of legal punishment decided that literally only one person out of the three cops deserved to be charged with something, and that was "wanton endangerment" for bullets that ended up going through other apartments
no one was charged for breonna taylor's death despite her complete and total innocence
people are extremely pissed off
yeah, it's becoming exceedingly clear that this sort of thing is more common than people want to believe
deescalation training isn't just limited, it's actually been deemphasized as time goes by
there's rhetoric going around at high levels of police organizations that purposefully pit police officers _against_ the common citizen
i forget the name of the dude responsible but there's at least one person who goes around giving presentations to this effect
about how the police necessarily should be considered "above" people who aren't cops
that's kind of the thing pax, the mindset they're trying to foster is that people are criminals until prove innocent, rather than the reverse
thank you cy, that's the one
indeed
wow, that's way more fun than the sort of shit you usually say
whew lad
if you a PUSS
GET DAT CARD
GET IT NOW
good morning fellow humans
a quality beginning to the day
birds in general are rather fierce
they have this brutality to them that can be about as bad as a mammalian apex predator
but it's a totally alien sort of brutality
lions and bears rip their prey apart and eat them that way
seagulls and pelicans and shit aren't even apex predators but they swallow their food whole like some kind of monster
it's really weird
<a:monkaSWTF:466062925615071252>
yeah, i should try to talk in here a bit more often
it's been hard lately though
very busy/tired
death and decay are great topics tho
i used to study fungus in graduate school
mycorrhiza specifically
microscopic guys
yes, they're a ubiquitous fungus that forms relationships with something like 90% or more of all land plant species
the host plant gives them carbon in the form of sugar, the mycorrhiza is good at getting nutrients from the soil and they exchange them
kind of
the plants still do msot of the work, but it's true that without the mycorrhiza plants would not be nearly as successful as they are probably
it's pretty easy to see a difference in growth between mycorrhizal soil and non
does trade and barter fall under capitalist frameworks
oh yeah <@!146014279529791488> happy birthday you FUCK
because i can
is it?

this makes me feel nothing
you hurt to understand
get DUNKED ON i'm so bored
why is the end of september so slow
i don't know of any new shit coming out
thank god i have iconoclasts
is anyone even fucking alive right now
ugh, i hate pinging people
always feels like such a burden
<@&693935623966425219> YOU SIGNED UP FOR THIS HELL. who wants to watch wallace and gromit at, say, 1 or 2 PM EST? that should get all you euros this time since i'm such a filthy fucking american who can't do timezones. <:greentick:567088336166977536> YES <:no:524370222023442442> NO
yeah
ugh, god damn you
fucking
2 hours
wallace and gromit is great fun for all ages
it doesn't matter because it seems that every single time i ask, no one is around for it
so i might as well just knife the man and dog and be done with it
we were going to do all three
but alas
earwaax
inb4 read another book
tensei i don't know how to tell you that kids stuff can also have appeal for adults
and in this case you're not even right
wallace and gromit has a lot of stuff in it that goes over kids' heads
if anything wallace and gromit is like a boomer cartoon
well stop doing that
but being have a job sucks
can't fault you there
yeah, i know
misha already notified me
we have too many ~~prices and vaules~~ streams
that's too many
we used to have none
IT'S FAT `bear` FRIDAY YOU FUCKING LOSERS
but not for another... x hours
well this is definitely something
the dystopian future encroaches steadily further
misha you're conflating gender with sex
if i'm understanding correctly, current trans ideology holds that anyone can be any gender they want, it's just a matter of how they feel
sex is the trickier on
makin, go away
cringe
crrrrrrrrrringe!
<@!173936231229554688> i shoot into space
i'm greatly enjoying the game
and am finally starting to develop some more thoughts on it
yeah i'm in the rocket
i don't want to ask how close i am to beating it because i kind of want it to be a surprise
so i'll just keep playing
sorry, i got distracted
so
iconoclasts spoilers ||pretty annoyed that i was required to leave royal on the moon|| but whatever
alright
hm
well, i finished it
i think
there are two hidden achievements and i'm kind of hoping those reflect stuff i missed or if there's like a True Ending i missed
a bit out of nowhere
i mean, kind of interesting in design
i'll say this, it genuinely surprised me when i got to phase 2, and that's pretty impressive
but without anything else propping it up, it wasn't as satisfying as i would have liked
what did you get out of it mines
that they were all wrong in such an absurd way?
i guess so
i want to scream SUBVERTING EXPECTATIONS but it was at least an interesting twist, even if i don't like what it meant for the plot
anyway, i'll put that aside for now
<@!173936231229554688> i'm really glad i played that game, the beginning felt kind of shaky or even aimless to me but the level/enemy design was really solid almost everywhere
the music was great, the art was superb and stylistic
the story is my main sticking point and i wouldn't even say it was bad, it was just... kind of confusing, in the sense that what it led up to didn't feel very satisfying
lmao, wel
that's kind of the thing
is we were talking about this in relation to hollow knight when i started
as i got to the end of the game, i kind of solidified a comparison in my head
hollow knight is to earthbound what iconoclasts is to mother 3
in the sense that hollow knight had a lot less personal, character driven stuff going on in it
there was still some, but it was nowhere near as character driven as this one
so the point of the game is basically... ||trying to help the world is a pointless endeavor or will only make it worse?||
<@!173936231229554688> ||you mean like in the mind battles or something else?||
no
oh
no, two of them were
maybe the last one?
what was that all about
ah
not sure what the "correct" dialog choices might have been in that case
the first one was definitely attacking me, the second and third did nothing, and the last one was just crawling
sure
like, that makes sense
i guess it just feels a little understated, in the sense that it doesn't feel like there was much indication of connection between those things
and that's okay, the story was comprised of a lot of stuff like that, it was pretty consistent
oh? is there an alternative fight to that as well
i walked out on him
and it was all one guy who did this
the coding, art, music?
that's fucking bonkers
was the game successful enough to validate his effort
jesus christ
that makes me feel a little weird about it
anyway
solid 8/10 game, easily
maybe even a 9
no, i didn't realize that there were any and didn't think about it until it was too late
let's assume not
tell me what they aer
woc why are you such a fucking menace
do you enjoy pissing other people off for fun?
then proceed
alright, well
i think i'll wait until i feel like playing iconoclasts again to try tackling those
i'm glad i played it but i want to keep this streak of doing new things up
deus ex next probably?
let me see what my itinerary was
you mean kotor 2?
i've already played 1 to completion
i have not played system shock before
ah yes, metal gear solid was also on my list
no actually gnawms
i know close to nothing about the actual plot of any of those games
just a few memes here and there
the main problem is that i don't have any game consoles
~~and emulating playstation games is a fucking pain in the ass~~
please be quiet about dos2
neat!

<:monkaOMEGA:663106010344587279>
makin stood down because he thought it was in the best interests of the community and larger fandom at the time
that was before we realized we had basically no reason to entertain listening to hussie or his cabal
not to do what
yes
if i could explain what would happen and why i would absolutely tell my younger self about it
no, it's like
god, there's no way to just say it in a few words because it's really just that bizarre
a member of his staff called this entire community and especially the mod staff a ring of child abusers, we complained about this after said staff member refused to apologize for it, he demanded performative and invasive information from us, we expressed that we were extremely upset about it, then he told me i was going to have to replace most of my team because of that
like, what dimension do you need to be living in, in order to justify that chain of reasoning
were you not here for that reveal rina
i published the whole chain of emails concerning this
i'm pretty sure it's mostly him being extremely out of touch with fans and not understanding that demanding things from them like this is unreasonable
man, i was sitting on those emails for almost six months rina
i wanted to publish them the second we got done talking to hussie and it made me feel like absolute shit every day we didn't
doing it has almost certainly got me blacklisted too, so that's fun
a member of the team reached out to me a few days after and said "hey, hussie is very, very unhappy about this. he says he never wants to talk to you again and that he doesn't believe you should be in charge of these communities anymore"
<@!125433170047795200> i don't really see the difference
please explain
well, anyway
the entire mod team and i talked about it for a bit and basically replied "that's perfectly fine, we weren't looking forward to speaking with him again after the way things ended"
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i mean, honestly yes just a little bit
it was such a relief to get that stuff out in public so people could see it
i hate keeping things secret when they concern the community at large
tm is one of the various Voices of Dissent, typically
i appreciate her for it
<@!273994148825268224> don't get me wrong, i'm not happy that things turned out this way
it was actually extremely upsetting, i was kind of a nervous wreck for a period of almost half a year
i still think about the altercation almost against my will on a weekly basis
no, the first week of july
tm, we waited half a year to release the emails precisely because we were hoping to settle things in a more amicable fashion
the chat liaison that got set up for communication was basically never used
apparently whatever problems they had with oru community weren't pertinent enough to actually get our attention or anything
yes nostalgic, that's exactly what i was talking about
i don't know, there isn't much to say about it we haven't already said
the entire affair was disappointing and i learned the base meaning of the phrase "never mean your heroes"
even if there had been much interaction with the liaison, i don't know that it would have come to much
hussie basically ended negotiations with the strong implication that i would need to replace most of my team, and that was never going to happen
i made it extremely clear that i trust every member of the staff implicitly
i also secured the stipulation that i would have few, optimally none of the official team on the staff because it'd be a conflict of interest, so i'm not really sure where we would have gone with that
oh fuck, that's right rina
i don't know if i just missed it in this conversation but a member of the official staff actually tried to get discord to hand over this server and reddit to hand over the sub to them
they got told to fuck off both times apparently
i think i saw a tweet call tensei a nazi once
well
to bring it back to the previous conversation nost, i don't think any of us particularly care anymore
if there's exactly one thing we learned from this whole thing at the beginning of the year, it's that the opinions of the official team or people on twitter don't matter in the slightest and we should just not care what they have to say
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
yes, but why
üèì
ü•Å    ü•Å    ü•Å    ü•Å

grimp...
i'm reading a reddit thread about people getting burned out at work and crying and shit before their shfit
it's a dreadful reminder that people are still getting hit by this pandemic even in unconventional ways
<:annoyedpepe:430065054260658177>
it really do be like that sometimes
what's the bad news
it's still very much a pandemic, cases are picking up outside of america
or they were a couple weeks ago
foreigners are smarter than us so it's probably already under control again
oh yeah that's true too
good to know we fucking suck
anyway gnawms the answer is kind of
i do have "a job"
in that i'm getting paid to do something
but it's not a real job
i'm basically an in-home caretaker for my grandma now
my grandparents can only afford to pay me about a third of what the job usually would if i was actually working through some kind of organization for it
so i pick up odd jobs here or there if they present themselves, usually helping out neighbors or my gf's family since they're doing a lot of renovations right now
that's part of why i've been so fucking absent lately
yesterday i spent 10 hours painting bedrooms
er, two days ago
i would go into an at-length description of what taking care of my grandma entails but it's depressing and i don't want to bother anyone with that
yes, yes, good
god, you've had to take care of a relative or anyone like this? i am so sorry
this shit is the worst, i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy
ah, yeah
i get that too
ah, i see
i only had to take care of my mom after i got into college
parents divorced about a year after i moved away, and she's like chronically incapable of helping herself
so she and my siblings moved in with me so i could make sure they were all getting taken care of
mom only got sick towards the end of that, for reasons i'm not sure i should go into here
as it is though, i can't imagine taking care of her the way you're talking about for "most of my life"
that sounds completely insane

i've basically given up trying to make time for it i'm too stupid
yeah, just make it clear that it's an archived page
no problem
it might seem kind of pointless but i agree with the idea
it's good just for reference
"these pages were all archived on such and such dates"
sure yeah]
"all of this was current up to x date"
indeed
it's just good documentation
no not really, i'm wiped
sorry nost
but that's the primary audience woc
people who don't know how to do basic technological things anymore
i keep thinking about how people younger than us are losing the ability to type because they just have smartphones now
typing might become a specialty skill again
it's not a meme that is completely correct
that is what i'm talking about
"the vast majority"
of course you're not going to need a stupid fucking keyboard if you're not working a job like data entry
i'm specifically talking about jobs that require keyboards
are you SOME KIND OF BUFFOON
i'm not trying to make it sound like younger people are morons for being unable to type quickly on a keyboard either, clearly there is a medium that exists for them which is more efficient
i straight up do not believe that you can reach 70 wpm with two fingers
that is fucking absurd
what the actual fuck
this is blowing my mind
i feel like i'm having an out of body experience
it's just a matter of how you learn i guess
i actually had typing lessons in school but this is also how i've figured it out over the years to go as fast as i can
i mean, i would argue that it's actually worth knowing if you care about typign truly quickly, because i can type almost twice as fast as someone like lat
and i am EXTREMELY doubtful that most people who type with 2 fingers are that fast
70 wpm with 2 fingers, jesus fucking christ
it's not, you just sucked at doing homerow
it may be faster for _you_ but that's not the same thing
shut the fuck up, you empathetic piece of shit
how dare you make people feel like they're normal and acceptable
no nostalgic it was just the one
dero caught something like over 20 fish and i caught 6
one of them had a FUCK ton of eggs, but only one of them ||spunked|| on me

it's not like mammals, it's like
well, if you've ever seen nature documentaries you probably understand, it's very liquidy

b3es, unfortunately we're the weirdoes who type fast
yeah, let me try it with only two fingers
<@!227181775221161984> do you use thumb for space or just two fingers ever
like, only index fingers?
alright, let's give this a shot

i don't know how you can do this
i mean, maybe if i did it all the fucking time and didn't do it the other way ever, i'd get better at it
it's just so alien to me
gotta love how deviation works
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i want 300 wpm
i want to destroy my keyboard on a daily basis from sheer speed of use
i mean, i still type faster than you, and the operative point remains that, on average, typing off homerow isn't as quick as typing on
so all you've proven is that you're an anomaly
now we must study you to learn the deeper secrets of the universe
that study is WRONG because it goes agaisnt what I WANT TO BELIEVE
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
30 people is extremely low for a skill as ubiquitous as typing

how many years did it take us to get hiveswap act 1 again?
did anyone talk about the fact that we passed hiveswap act one's third anniversary less than two weeks ago?
do you think we'll get act 2 in less or more time than it took to create act 1?
i guess the question is, what _is_ the hiveswap act 2 team at this point
i'm getting the vague impression that _no one_ knows what's going on anymore
i literally mean that even the people officially contracted to work on the game don't know what to do at this point

how the fuck you gonna scare off people with that
no wonder zeon is losing, they keep wasting their time on shit like this
sorry, i was operating off of this exchange
is the space jam
alriiight
in seriousness, how do you retain this much trivia about all these properties
or is gundam a special case
does gundam as a property ever do the thing star trek did with a few versions of the enterprise where they released the schematics
that and a floor plan
"deck 1 consists of these rooms" etc
oh yeah perfect
i love shit like this
i can't remember it as well as i want to but it's delightful stuff
speaking personally, massive kudos to tomino for literally making white base a giant dragon
it's so silly but the fact that it's never once questioned in-universe is the sort of thing i greatly prize
fictional designs for super massive weaponry are the best
the super MAC platforms in halo are just üëå
not to undercut this explanation, but what do you mean "design language"
oh, so you mean how each faction tends to have consistently designed equipment
yes, i was going to say
i figured that most of the covenant weaponry/vehicles are dominated by the purple/smooth aesthetic since the elites were historically the premiere race involved in protecting the faction
but then in 3 you can see the introduction of stuff like the prowler/chopper that matches the bruteshot in terms of sharp, bladed design
something to accentuate the sheer force they employ
the brute plasma rifle is kind of an odd one out here since it's literally just red plasma rifle
probably best they got rid of that in 3
yan'mee i think
for fuck's sake internet, could you be ANY slower
aw damn i was SO CLOSE
it's yanme'e
fucking apostrophes
to be fair though, it's less prestigious to retain a lot of halo lore because after a certain point it just becomes absurd and unenjoyable
they really should have kept the forerunners a purely historical plot device and refrained from ANY interaction with them
we also didn't need to be informed of the exact nature of the flood, they worked best as an unknown
i guess there's only so much mileage you can get out of "ancient alien technology" but still

but the fact that it's unassisted is extremely exciting
misha what's your estimate on real life giant robot battles
when will we have them
okay then, alternative question
which of the current world leaders do you think would be fully capable AND willing to carry out a nuclear holocaust
yes, FBI, this man
14 years is awfully specific, why do you offer that number in particular
<:ree:475542526791516170>
<@!207991389613457408> i just remembered
i'm trying to intersperse the video games i play with visual/written stories
and vice versa
the thing i wanted to do after beating iconoclasts was read some of the star wars EU
could you possibly give me like
a core set of works
so that i could be in on the memes and have a good time talking about it
while also not drowning in the dozens upon dozens of books and comics and stuff that are out there
anything ancillary to that or will the kotor comics suffice
fuck, i guess i should do kotor 2 finally
i mean
i don't HAVE to but i've been meaning to anyway
fuck, i'm glad i've been trying to enjoy new stuff
it's easy to get stuck in a rut and just do old stuff all the time
it's time for an EXPANSION OF EXPERIENCE
see? there's always room for improvement
<:dailydose:652294292332871730>
this made me think of possible examples where i've teabagged people and i don't really want to share what i came up with
hey look over there, it's a distraction
that's why `the money` is the best damn game ever made. i give it a five out of five... billion. it fucking su-- ```good```
inb4 the dream i had about adopting a black kid
guess i should finish this glass of UV vodka
it's only midnight
time to get crunk
man, it's just the worst when your basil goes bad
lmao
<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
fuck, i'm able to watch queen's don't stop me now music video without it looking blurry at all, i need to drink faster
damn, i just future banned myself
<:monkaOMEGA:663106010344587279>
<:phil:523535182742028300>
just make it a strange color
"the sky has been... neon pink"
linkybot on fire today
the haze thing stopped a couple days ago
about a week ago it was _extremely_ bad
the california wildfires were reaching all the way out where i lived, 1,700 miles away
it caused the sun to dim a bit and made that change of color with the sunset happen a lot sooner in the day, honestly pretty freaky
no, i live in the midwest
about an hour and a half east of KC
kansas city, for all you plebs
popeyes is the superior fried chicken establishment
it turns out that after i faked my death to escape my responsibilities as the server admin, i was found on a caribbean island drinking endless pina coladas and mojitos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxvKuEWeVg8
p i z z a p ar t y
if you got a blunt, then we can get high
if you wanna come then pick up the phone
but don't get caught with the weird calzone
dude i'm having a great time reti
i'm just enjoying random music and slowly getting drunk out of my mind
it's probably not time to start another religion in #posts_while_shitting but it's a great evening
nah i'll be fine
i'm taking it slow and chilling
fuck you bitch you wanna fight
i still consider passing out on the bathroom floor an experience in humility that every person should experience at least once in their lives
yeah basically lat
it's like a safety feature
i've been there a few times and it's kind of like being on a deserted island where you know other people can physically see you, but at any given moment only one or a few people might have the megaphone so other people can hear you screaming
sorry woc, maybe another time
dude, that night was kind of insane
if i recall, i was trying to get rid of the rest of my sangria that day
my sister and her boyfriend had come to visit in the middle of the day while i was already really drunk, and it just kept getting worse from there
then i ended up passing out on the bathroom floor at about... 9, 10 PM? woke up at midnight or 1 AM and started ranting about how it was an exercise in experiencing the greater universe
hold on, <@!125433170047795200> do you think it would be kosher to post screenshots of that exchange here
or is that verboten
i forgot how many of these messages i sent included increasingly verbose ways to say i was taking a shit
this is probably something that would get other people in this server banned, i probably shouldn't send it
it's kind of foul
you know what fine
i'll assemble a giant screencap and anyone who wants to see it can DM me for it
the screencap has been assembled
if you want to see me being a complete degenerate, just ask
<:thonk:538981238082502677>
i regret much, but such is the natural path of life on our way to becoming better
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
it's a different flavor of depravity
because the cultural horniness isn't actually what we're talking about, it's about how that aspect of society is taken advantage of in various places
shut up satoko
shut the fuck up
THE PLEBIAN HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S IN STORE FOR HIM
imagine if the oldowan stone industry had never existed
true rationality is able to account for cultural and subjective rationales though, be sure to remember that
WE CALL THEM WORDS
this is the soundtrack to this conversation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb0TZwbxbtk
fuck, the spanish flea might as well be the soundtrack to this entire channel's existence
i don't know lat, consider if literally all art was made for the sole purpose of stoking some other emotion, like sadness or anger or happiness
is that by itself a bad thing? maybe not necessarily, but if every person was motivated to create material for the sole purpose of fulfilling _one_ singular emotion or desire, it would be pretty limiting of the spectrum of experiential awareness
<@!195290352838508544> i think you have a problem with conflating more specific arguments with larger concepts
ie misha arguing for one specific facet of culture and art and then you trying to relate it with something that's basically unrelated
it's entirely copacetic to try and argue that something like the larger porn industry is bad, and then also have instances of the oppression of women occur elsewhere in the world
one might argue that those two things are indeed related to each other
i have no idea who doja cat is
krato
you realize i'm really drunk right now, right
i'm just jumping in when i feel like it to stir the pot
then stfu

<:eddy:659154159169306644>
also kind of, it's UV vodka with lemonade
very smooth, tasty, but not very satisfying
i think that's a false equivalency lat
it's an objective principle that american culture is pervasive worldwide where most other cultures are not
<@!207991389613457408> i think you need to get better at couching your arguments in terms that don't rely on calling people who disagree with you morons
rolling my eyes
that's my main problem with this conversation
you trying to capture people with rhetorical traps is fine
just don't be overly rude or mean about it
it's fun to see people fall into conversational pit traps
just don't make the end result of that calling them morons and imbeciles
yeah, but you make a point of being particularly vicious about it
do you see how this conversation has transformed to surround your mannerisms and behavior
don't do that
it means you're doing shit that disrupts the conversation
misha just doesn't give a shit about the larger ramifications of fucking up these conversations with combative rhetoric
misha irl: "i am like tiger chase rabbit, it slow enough"
SPHINX
<@!184545248930693120> don't do that here
save it for woc's server
<a:dogebonk:688579925564719201>
god, i still have half my tankard of vodka
same mines,
instead of being horribly anxious about conversational quality i have been riding the waves of stupidity while listening to lemon demon and god damn do i feel good
üçø
look
if you're not actively participating in the discussion, just settle down
sit down, have a pint, and wait for this whole thing to blow over
am i wrong for finding great entertainment in this conversation?
i get the feeling people are getting their feelings hurt
that's fair
i hope it's true at least
i just want everyone to have a good time
mamma mia
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE IN WESTERN SOCIETY
<:waitwhat:316648744579760128>
holy fucking shit misha, i'm fucking losing it
i can't feel my fingers because i'm laughing so hard
fucking hell
i can't breathe

holy shit, my fucking sides
dude, i'm at the point of laughing where it's more like wheezing for breath and sobbing
i need to stop, it hurts
quite possibly
i laughed so hard at moonjail's comment that i could physically feel the blood rushing into my skull and face
i now have a stuffed nose because of that
this chat exists for two reasons: 1) rational debate on all manner of topics that concern the world as a whole 2) making people laugh so hard that it brings them closer to the grave
do not post hugh
i refuse it
<@!168980988477702145> no it's not, i'm to drunk
i probably won't remember much of it when i wake up tomorrow
we should probably stop, yeah
is it off??
communism doesn't work libtards
GIVE IT UP, BABY
<@!168980988477702145> what's cooler than being cool
god
i
i'm fucking losing my mind
i wish every night were like this
a whirling dervish of insanity and stupidity

"it's just weird to know what your mom ate before your dad laid pipe" keeps popping into my head like a fucking phantom and it makes me laugh until i have tears coming out of my eyes
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
oh fuck, jesus christ
D--> ignore plebs we need to preserve _some_ sancitty
fuck
god, what a wonderful night
yeah i feel better than i have in weeks
i live for these moments where it's chaotic like a train wreck but it manages to be funny
<a:eyesshake:526187606610804737>
while he's asleep, let me say: i fear woc's brapposting
it is too powerful
god
my fucking lungs hurt
<@!168980988477702145> i didn't write a full fledged entry but i've written musings about tonight
i might flesh it out later
we'll see
those are rookie numbers trip
i've actually gotten to the point that i feel sick whenever i eat something _healthy_
oh fuck i didn't have my medicine today
thanks for the reminder
having no health insurance is great, i've had to slowly ramp down how much of this medication i've been taking because i can't afford to refill my prescriptions
it's my type II bipolar anti-depressant so i've been cutting 25 mg from it every two weeks
weirdly enough it's made me feel slightly more energetic
dude fucking seriously
what the hell is that
insurance is a fucking rip off
that hasn't been happening NOW krato that's a historical problem
now i'm doing okay
gawd
i can't hear you
it's just type ii lat
it's like depression with the chance for a manic episode
mama mia
why would we do that
no, i don't
spell it out for me princess
<@!207991389613457408> you're never gonna live this down, i hope you realize that
it's how you accumulate life experiences though tera
do embarrassing or horrible stuff enough times and you become a competent, seasoned adult
in theory at least
these haven't done very much for me all things considered
they were more critical when i was finishing up my master's degree and needed to avoid feeling like a critical failure every day
now that i'm out of school i just feel nothing all the time so it's not helping
this is the problem with philosophy
it might be unbelievable, except for the fact that it's a common state of existence that we're all experiencing right now
no matter how unlikely or weird something might appear, the more salient idea is whether that thing actually exists to begin with
what a coincidence
the euros all woke up and suddenly the fun is over
i have been here since the beginning
misha's family pasta made me laugh so hard that my kidney's hurt
this is nothing by comparison
i mean, putting aside whether his movies have any value, their associations with max landis are just completely unfortunate now
are those videos fully taken down or are they just unlisted
future was great
HERE WE ARE IN FEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAR
what the fuck are you talking about the ending was great
what's wrong with it
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i don't think it's character development they "left out" of the og show
i mean, you're right inasfar as the like
PTSD shit is concerned
but a significant part of the development is him coming to terms with the fact that he doesn't HAVE to be a defender anymore
it's like losing your purpose and trying to make up for lost time
inb4 OFF MODEL
sorry, fat fuck friday was two days ago
that is quite a bird though
"mom, dad, what happened to lapis and peridot?"
"oh, sorry dear, they got sick and were taken to the barn upstate. they're being taken care of there"
"can we go visit?" "no"
how is he so big, jesus christ
30 dollars
man, can't say they aren't skilled at profiting off of every little thing possible
nat
ass crops?
when did this start
oh just now
he looks like an okay bloke
i didn't write that
probably searching for moon landing hoax videos and other stuff in that vein
"those are kind of extreme"
in civilized places i'm sure, but you forget where i'm from
out here, moon landing denialism is like a local sport
uh
terriers were specifically bred for hunting vermin, like rats
i don't recall anything about them being bred to hunt snakes
hm
whatever, i don't know enough about the actual culturalism of using dogs to comment
i know about their morphological lineages but not their relationship with humans
"You didn't know you were ordering a handburger." is a quality sentene
mmmm nah, not really
there isn't too much overlap there
man, rereading the conversation last night
what a fun time
let's do it again soon
read up b3es
looking at large dogs
i should probably go take a look at shelters nearby and see if there are any that need to be adopted
i need to stop looking at pets
going hard like harrison ford in here
i sleep
later
go to bed, when you wake up we'll probably play a bit
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
it's like haggling with a toddler
"if you go to bed now we'll do that thing you like tomorrow"
no, dirt sifting is just a meme

fuck you baseball is great
leave baseball out of this
the only people who say this have never been to a baseball game or have only been to band ones
going to a good baseball game is fucking exciting
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU IN THE ASS
man, what happened to the tourettes guy
THE SPORT
THE SPORT
OF THE PEOPLE
<:dabeegMayahn:679423476268007424>
i like sports that give you weapons
i went to my first and only hockey game so far a couple years ago
i had heard how violent it was of course but i didn't anticipate a player falling down near the puck and a bunch of players from the other team coming up and jabbing their fucking sticks into his side
i actually thought he was going to die for a moment
every time a member of the away team got out of the penalty box the announcer would of course say "they're back at full strength" and everyone from home would scream "AND THEY STILL SUCK"
<@!338881173268987904> it was the kansas city mavericks, i don't remember who the away team was
i think they had like a grey/black themed getup though
i think baseball is more weirdly codified than other sports though, isn't it
jesse what the fuck are you talking about
holy fucking shit gnawms, that gif is making me cringe so hard
i can't imagine getting hit in the throat with a fastball
oh yeah, sure reti
who could have seen that one coming
that was bizarre reti
what started the fight
delightful
it really is just a thinly veiled excuse to beat the shit out of each other
i'm honestly not sure what else could have been done, looking at it
it's just an enormous mess
stop playing games for lesbians
silence
anyway, play uhh
well, make sure you have l4d2 ready for later
too bad
until then, try playing uhh
uh,,,
uh...............................................
is hades good
i'm picking it up then
not possible to stream shit i'm afraid
internet is just too bad
streams are basically dead unless i can get better interwebs
probably impossible
<@!273994148825268224> <@!266807632390520833> <@!257144766901256192> i'm going to be out for a couple hours, if you still want l4d2 tonight make sure to find four more people who are definitely going to be there to play tonight
<@!266807632390520833> i got home like half an hour ago but i've been talking to my grandparents because grandma had a fucking conniption while i was gone
why do old people have to be like this
anyway, i'm home
<@!273994148825268224> <@!257144766901256192> gimme a sitrep do we have enough people

other geographical regions will have to deal with climate change in their own way as time goes by
california is not the only place that will be affected
any coastal regions will experience loss of property
the estimated number of displaced peoples due to rising sea levels caused by climate change is somewhere in the hundreds of millions
we might have increasing technological capability but that doesn't make it any less of a challenge
the conflicts stemming from current ineptitude of climate policy will affect billions

yeah i've been waiting for titanic 2 for a long time
i wonder if the new avatar movies will actually be good somehow, or if it'll just crash james cameron's career cuz no one cares anymore
or if they'll be successful regardless of quality
which currently encourages people to do nothing and then also yells at the fans when they don't like what hapens
why are you so fixated on me today
the dirt stuff goes without saying but it looks like you've pinged me like 4 times

what's the matter with it
you know what they do that IS bad? nerd crew
i can't stand it
wow solar, that is almost exactly what it would sound like
i'm stunned
wait, what
not really surprised
i really don't want to see this right now
my life is already hard enough, seeing this kind of shit would just be aggravating

look at your life, look at your choices
whatever the hell gets people to leave us alone

it would help if you assembled them correctly
john i think noita is just a prime example of a game where you have to pull out all the stops in order to make it
if you can't get through the ice caves with what you've got then you need to backtrack to find more upgrades OR you lose, it's just that simple
i finally found a combination of wands by the ice caverns that allowed me to break into the east and west worlds
i used that to accrue an insane amount of power and then went back to beat the game as a practical god
is what
the only major difference is the addition of a shit ton of perks and spells
no idea
i dont keep up with the development
i just played it to beat the shit out of it
once i accomplished that i put it down
maybe for good
yeah no, they're distinctly different processes even if they're intrinsically tied together
oh, you're new to the game?
make sure you're exploring fully
there are a LOT of secrets and ways around
did you ever fall down the giant rock shaft?
yeah, it's the main way back up to the surface
indeed
there isn't a ton of stuff like _that_ but go far to the right and left on any given level and you'll find weird stuff
rule of thumb is that you can keep going until you encounter extremely dense rock
and even then
some stuff goes right through it

oh, shit, this is not the mod channel
ah well, fuck it
yeah no kidding
i just wanna `chat about online literature` for god's sake
spittle spattle
also yeah, i guess it could be considered literature inasmuch as it's historical non-fiction
first hand source and all that
<a:aRainbowHusky:599354145773715469>
that very idea is part of why i started writing it in the first place mines
i like this place a lot and i want to keep the memory of it alive even if just a niche thing for historians or something
i don't know if it actually will be at all, this stuff is all pretty esoteric and dumb
but at least it's written down
you were going to go bowling?

was it not just a flub
okay so it's a misunderstanding

i was hoping for sweet political drama
goodness knows we haven't had enough of that in the last 4 years hahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahahshshahdfiashfdsioagnfasovnoas

okay, what the fuck is going on
what bait are you trying to hit me with
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
what no
not at all
we have an average rate of growth of about 5 new users per day
we're not at 18,000 yet
even if we were, it'd take over a year to get to 20,000
i don't know what the actual average is, i'm just guessing
i can find out for the period beginning at this year
the average number of new users per day is approximately 7.3 for this year
does that count people who leave makin
go check the arquiusbot reports each day
in modlog
arquius ain't wrong, i'm staring at the number of people in the server right now and it's totally consistent with what arquiusbot and i have been recording

in terms of word count, i think it's getting up there yeah
in terms of time it took? no
this is where the last update was in half the time
you know
i guess that canwc, wtc, and homestuck to some degree are all arguments for not waiting to release content in giant amounts as opposed to dribbling it continuously over time
i'm gonna finish the last entry notes i had written and get makin to check them over
i think that most of us in here have experienced enough things at this point to recognize the difference between a release cycle that is a LOT of content aggregated over a large period of time, versus release schedules that involve less content released at smaller intervals more regualrly
usually content being released all at once in large batches hinders theorycrafting
and it also makes it harder to retain an audience
alright makin, go add your commentary you <:foooooooooool:292673270199746561>
just a warning, the last entry is kind of a sad sack one
also you know what i want to add a few more details to it, i was keeping it vague but there's no reason for it
okay that's good enough i think
makin better commentate on shit or ELSE
he usually gets to it by the next day
it takes concurrently with the trilogy
oh that was fast
alright i'll work on the entries here in a couple hours
release'll be out later tonight
i'm not able to work on it right now
make sure to post a link
i don't know if my internet can handle it but i want to try and watch
this PBS broadcast is bizarre to watch
i die marinette
uh
is the live PBS feed silent for anyone else
there we go
are you fucking serious
the debate starts at fucking 9 PM EST?
yeah, something came up
i heard it was a complete shitshow though
like literally, one of the news anchors on ABC called it a shitshow
yeah, the moderators have always been disappointing in these debates
put a kill switch in their microphones or else they're useless
have some fucking balls
yeah i saw that
to me, that should be like game over right there
"denounce this literal white supremacist group"
"nah. hey, said white supremacist group? stand by, we'll need you later"
how fucking stupid can you get
god, what a fucking mess
it's enough to make me want to drink myself to death
i think they're banking on the idea that another trump term would further galvanize people towards leftist thinking
i don't know what else could explain it
i'm not gonna lie, i read the update today and i actually forgot that we had an update
it'll have to be tomorrow
after work today i'm so fucking tired and stressed out i just can't do html
go to bed
i'll work on it tomorrow
it's always worth getting sleep
trust me
i've often had that thought of "i get up in x hours why bother"
but fucking trust me
even just 2 hours makes a world of difference in being able to handle shit
5 hours? you'll be able to survive
go to bed qweq
bwee
Pee
carl's commentary on point in an almost acidic fashion as usual

"if they don't want to be crucified then maybe they should move somewhere else"
"but not here, i don't want them taking our jobs away"
apparently biden interrupted the debate 73 times, and trump interrupted it 359 times

misha this is making me lose my shit
WHO WANTS CHIPOTLEEEEEEEEEEEE
speaking of old news
i should work on that spat entry
time to get it converted to HTML
thanks b3es
<@!125433170047795200> do people ever call you pecan sandy?
doing some reorganization to SPAT that i wasn't expecting
alright guys, spat update <https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/bookii2020.html#10S>
_He was destroyed!_

ah, fuck
i really need to hook up my file manager to filezilla, i'm tired of logging into cpanel every time i need to fix shit
mic wrong
alright both fixed
yeah, here
https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/bookii2020.html#10S
your time is UP and your TIME IS _UP_
alright then, keep your secrets
i only record what i bother to at this point
mod chat leaks are bad but i didn't think to say anything about them
gnawms i can't even afford to pay myself to write spat
it's been downhill forever
death
Yeah
Its neat fantasy but this isnt fantasy
All I want is a basic shack, is that too much to ask
Depends on how close you live to them
Perfect house
Gimme
Wannabe my fist in your face
"Sweet, time for bed" I say as I crawl into my literal hole and cover myself with leaves
Imagine having a bed
Fucking modernites
Unga
Like, into an apartment?
Cost of rent times five
Depends on what you have and the ability to move stuff
If you have few things then yes
If you have enough stuff that you need more than just your car it can rack up costs real quick
A relatively small UHaul trailer can cost upwards of several hundred dollars
Yeah you can't fit that all into a car
Then you can probably get the bed, but I'm not sure about the desk
You'll have to see when the time comes
Indeed
As for the actual costs, if you dont need moving services then it's still whatever you need for rent times x
If you start with five times as much as your expected rent you're gonna be comfy for a bit
At minimum its twice to three times rent because of security deposit and food, utilities, etc
Good
Not this time
Never happened
We made it up
four hundred degrees that's why they call me mr. fahrenheit
yeah
it's very niche
that's because you're weird
good god y'all
say it, SAY IT, _SAY IT_
no i'm just quoting war
D--> ignore plebs
fuck
i wish i could do that reliably
i need the money
it being free is good too though
information being widely available is a good ideal to strive for
that made me frown hard
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
fucking hell
i'll just make linkybot do all the work from now on
it's not halloween yet
or october yet
yeah it's only 11:25 for me
you fool
you buffoon
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>

LET IT BE KNOWN
that was me trying to tell y'all to stop with the spam
i love a good spam burger every now and then but you guys were slowing down my entire fucking client with that
true dingus
do as you like then, i sleep
linkybot was so on point earlier, now it's just depressing
EAT, SLEEP, FUCK, HIDE
nah it's great
it does not, spoilers
give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you
yah hah hah!
truly spooky month is the best month of the year
it doesn't
i think you're crazy
anyway motherfuckers get SPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKED
hey baby wake up from your asleep
we have arrived onto the future and the whole world is become
elektronik supersonik
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyG-xu-7SQ
<:pog:576614562598748213>
well i think it's swell
wieners
it's spookymonth baby
go do who is in botspam
fuck you
higher res
hey love crusader, i want to be your space invader
for you i will descend the deepest moon crater, eyes more strong than darth vaper
obey me, i is your new dictator, for you is venus, i am mars, with you i is more richer than all the tzars
make a wishes on a shooting stars, then for you i will play on my COSMIC GUITARS
what's an svg again
oh, there might have been one of those at some point but i definitely don't have it now
<@!280782538711236608> go watch Zlad!'s Elektronik Supersonik
<@!168980988477702145> fragments or something??

i know right
pretty fucking crazy
contrarian
i would have preferred keeping them for staff because, fuck's sake, it's not like we're getting paid
enough mods spoke out against it and said that it they didn't want them that i just said "who cares" and got rid of them
strictly speaking it is unfair but again, who cares
i don't want to rehash it
it's not worth my time or effort
well, i'm not bringing them back NOW
maybe some time in the future after we really, truly sell out
hey guys, pay me 10,000 dollars and i'll bring back vanity roles
DEAL OR NO DEAL
okay, well
i'm saying you suck and you're stupid
so get the fuck out
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
it was fucking great earlier
what is this obnoxious music liveblogging
oh man, i didn't realize the new smash characters are getting revealed tomorrow
that's gonna be pretty disappointing
what's the over/under on yet another mario character
i've never played mario RPG
lots of people want geno though, so that'd be cool
i'm still holding out on the possibility of getting isaac one day
golden sun you wiener
that's right canis
dig the knife in a little deeper
twist it
shut up nat
why are you like this
go drink some soda
you... DOUBLE GREMLIN
give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you
holy shit that smash reveal
what a day
it's like orangey brown
autumn color
i miss him too, he was great
i forget, did he die before or after breath of the wild came out
a damn good tablet too
https://i.redd.it/as396nsuihq51.png
in orbit
and also good, i can't wait for trump to become so apoplectic that he fucking explodes
he is not going to handle being muted well at all
both are true
John Egbert Must Die
did you know there used to be a relative of alligators and crocodiles with longer limbs, so that they were able to run at full speeds on land for extended periods of time?
it's theorized they were so effective at hunting that they killed all of their prey and starved themselves to death
them's the one
imagine that coming after you
more like -200,000
and even then it's likely that homo erectus, neanderthalensis, and habilis all did shit like this
so more like -2,000,000
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
damn, laying it out straight
you know, objectively speaking that meme and all others like it are extremely dumb
yet, somehow i find myself enjoying them immensely
it feels like it hearkens back to a simpler ime
a time when memes didn't need to be justified by some kind of stupid context, they just existed
go play your fucking tabletops get out
GET OUT
I AM UNTETHERED AND MY RAGE KNOWS NO BOUNDS
yer damn right
<@!173936231229554688> depends, i might be down for that
the world is filled with some very colorful and interesting people
not all of them are interesting for good reasons, but still
i was going to say, i thought the stereotype was from the fact that it makes you shed fat like water
but no, it has to do with appetite
fair enough
i'm more befuddled really
i don't know if i would say it works pretty well
the result is honestly like some kind of lynchian nightmare
eraserhead starring ugandan knuckles and big chungus
and catholic mario, for some reason
why catholic mario
<:pepeHmm:547972934715834408>
i feel like my brain is falling into some kind of wormhole
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
this is sickening
please don't say it like that
please don't
please don't
in seriousness i'm about to start reading the kotor comics
i've been wanting to do this for a while so i'm a little excited
eating lunch
how about yous
nice
what exactly was the problem
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
yep that sounds about right
i also did some stuff like that for my grandparents
they didn't pay me, but it's easy to forget just how little most people know about this stuff
i think getting paid 50-100 bucks is fair based on your level of prior expertise
monetize the shit out of your services
i thought you were speaking in terms of freedom money
isn't 100 reales like 40 cents
i saw that
but 20 bucks isn't bad i guess
you can get a hamborgar
yeah
it wasn't free, you did a thing and you got paid
doesn't matter if the thing was easy for you, it wasn't easy for them so they asked you to do it instead
that counts in my opinion
it's why i pay artists generously whenever i commission them, because i don't undervalue people's work and expertise
capitalism only works when not everyone is a stingy, greedy bastard
some people don't know how to do that or are too lazy
it surprises me too, but still
<a:amegablobsweats:614486002291048459>
today feels vaguely cozy for some reason
reading comics, sipping a nice cold glass of water while laying in bed
a nice reprieve from the constant torment of real life
concert?
everyone knows that the real good shit comes from the most deranged individuals
you know, a year ago i think my eyes would have glazed over from seeing this
but given everything in the last month or two, this is fucking delightful
that's a pretty dark take on it
"freud tier take" got me good
FUCK
FUCK YOU REDDIT FOR SHOWING ME THE NEWSLETTER AGAIN
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS
any time we debate that particular idea i remember the picture of the really elderly lion that had grown so weak it couldn't hunt anymore, and it seems pretty downtrodden
i don't know if that's just anthropomorphizing a wild animal but still
i have to imagine that animals feel _some_ kind of sadness or upset when their body doesn't respond exactly how they want
i've always been a fan of the word "simian"
i once made dero cry when we were both really young because i called her a simian
there are at least a few species that do
there was actually a pretty interesting study about this
a group of researchers created an artificial monkey baby that could do basic movements and had a camera in one of its eyes
they set it up nearby a clan of monkeys and they ended up adopting it
at one point they knocked the fake baby over and were like "oh shit"
all of the monkeys got together and tried to see if it was alright, but when it didn't move because it was fucking fake, they thought they had killed the baby and started hugging each other
i don't know if it's a universal trait, but there are definitely--fuck you
fuck you for making me laugh at that
it's difficult to say what their understanding of death _is_ but clearly they have learned that if something is dead, they've lost a member of their group
i mean
this can be seen in how we react to news of someone's death that we're close to versus a complete unknown
right as we speak, there is at least one person around the world who is dying right now
do we feel bad about that? maybe abstractly as humans, but on a gut level no
i imagine it's similar for most animals with the ability to contemplate things
the loss of the familiar is usually upsetting, but being tied to death is the more nuanced idea i guess
2020? internet? giant cities? what are you talking about??
it was absolutely terrible!
<@!458802649307807754> you are a wiener
so i decree
pugs are nice enough animals but i feel so bad for them
they've been genetically bred to have fucked up air pathways
NOBODY DOES IT BETTER
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VMKb2uWyCs
prooobably not but who knows, things might conspire such that i am
STOP THE CHAIRS
DO NOT THROW CHAIRS INTO THE RING
aye
what's up
yeah that's completely standard operating temp
if it was shooting up to 80-90C you'd have a problem
that's normal mines
consider it like a car where 40-50C is idling RPM
accelerating causes the RPM to spike briefly but once you're cruising it settles at a higher but not too high rate
i did the same thing when helping my younger sister build her PC, haha
it'll be okay, you'd have to wipe it with a fucking cloth or some bullshit to actually make a difference
i'll try my best misha, it's just that i'm working tomorrow
if i'm lucky she'll be sleeping most of the day, so i'll peek in if i can
also depends on internet
should i play KOTOR2 before reading the comics or does it not matter
MAN CHILDREN
<@!207991389613457408> <@!125433170047795200> play kotor2 before reading the comics, y/n
can i come with
i don't know those blokes
charLENE
get these ripper legends a couple stubbies and a pack of menthols
they dropped a space colony
ARE YOU READY KIDS?
where else are we going to put all of the toxic animals though
debates are over
people on reddit were calling this as soon as his aide tested positive
like, regardless of whether he tested positive or not, he was going to use it as an excuse to quarantine and avoid debates
treatment methods have gotten better
he's probably not going to die regardless of how severe it is
yeah they're not doing intubations i think, it's more about administering steroids
it's possible that his comorbidities--high age, severe obesity, extreme drug usage--will have some impact but i still doubt he'll die
i don't even really want him to, it would give the right a martyr
it's far from the worst outcome, which is "nothing, which emboldens his base to say it's not that big of a deal and makes them spread it even more"
but it would still suck
also same mines
either way, most important thing to confirm immediately from this is debates are cancelled
which to be real is only in trump's favor, he was shooting himself in the foot with an AK47
i have bad news for you, trump dying won't make all of the stuff he's been doing and the people who have been supporting him stop
we've got a long road ahead of us no matter what
i wonder what the people in his base who sincerely think the virus is a hoax are making of this
i wonder how much cognitive dissonance one person can have before it literally kills them
shut up you dumb fake rationalist
people were plenty excited for hitler dying and they had good reason for it
not saying trump is hitler (although he certainly tries, in his way)
fuck you i got it out first
anyway, my point is that there are plenty of reasons to hate this guy and i don't blame anyone who wants him dead
i don't personally wish death on him because i don't think it would actually help too much given how complex the political situation is
but do i get upset with people in the latin american or black communities for wishing death on him? hell no, they have plenty of reason to be unutterably pissed with his general existence
pence couldn't get much done in a month and no one would vote for him because he has less charisma than a wet sack of gravel
almost certainly
i don't know, all i can think is "it is what it is"
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
it's like poetry, it rhymes
either way, october is starting off strong
alright, we get it
you have a hate boner the size of the sun
let's all settle down
<a:megababyvore:526984302907359232>
that's a good skeleboy
yawn
```I‚Äôm sorry but I do not believe it at all. I find it strange that Trump addressed and confirmed it so quickly. This is a super convenient way to have to skip the debates. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he claims the election is no longer fair or valid because he couldn‚Äôt participate in all of the debates. He gets to make a case for an illegitimate election.

Or he ‚Äúrecovers‚Äù within a few days and brags about how mild it was to prove how strong he is and that the virus isn‚Äôt that serious.

Everything this man has ever said is a lie. This situation seems no different to me.
```
thanks reddit user /u/OneHotHamSandwich
well, it doesn't seem to be a hoax, the white house doctor sent a memorandum out about it https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/read-letter-white-house-physician-dr-sean-conley-about-trump-n1241771
i think that a licensed medical practitioner lying about a yes or no test is a different thing from flubbing the results of a physical
yes, that is a very real possibility given everything
trump lies as easily as he breathes
i don't necessarily think that he's lying about this given everything, but i have little reason to believe what comes out of his mouth one way or the other
yeah, but how many elderly people abuse stimulants like they're candy
he can't be doing that well
kidpen it has to do with weighing risks versus benefits
personal hatred has to be laid aside if your goal is to figure out what the optimal path forward is
i don't know kidpen
i'm just some dumb fuck on the internet
well, as long as you're operationally defining it, that's fine
i disagree with that definition for "minor civil war" but i'm not exactly an expert
do you include the national guard as part of the military
depends on how coordinated a group like the proud boys gets
yeah, but that's lame
i have a list of ongoing bets recorded in a personal server
i want to see someone lose money
```bet between mrcheeze and misha: 50 bucks based on who wins 2020 election, misha wins if trump is elected

also bet 100 against boom for same

qweq bets 48.15 million BR dollars on trump losing

spider bets 50 cents on the ruble that trump loses

lat and misha, 50 bucks on whether a "civil war" breaks out in january based on election results, defined as 150 people at least in a coordinated group against the US military including national guard. lat wins if this occurs

moonjail will send me 20 bucks if trump starts a war or begins some kind of military intervention```
lat i can't afford to make any bets
what's the over/under on him or someone in his staff saying this for real
i don't believe they have the power to postpone the election
it's done on a state level, pretty sure the federal system has no say in that
people were saying the same thing about just trying to ignore the results of the election in the first place, trump doesn't have unilateral power to dismiss the electoral college
if the results come in and he's no longer president, the secret service is escorting him out once his tenure is up
get fucked
USELESS
anyway, upon reflection i think it's too soon to speculate on whether he's being truthful or not
i don't know why i'm hanging on to this, admittedly
i think it's just telling that my mistrust of this administration is so high that i literally can't decide whether they're lying about the president having coronavirus
yep, that's the nail
trump would never, ever, ever cancel a rally under normal circumstances
they're his favorite fucking thing in the world
well yeah, they're going to take every possible opportunity to get their business done no matter the semblance of hypocrisy
that's the republican way
here's the real question
was trump supposed to announce contracting the disease or was he supposed to keep it on the downlow
i mean, that's the most likely course
i'm just talking about how past presidents have done their utmost to keep illnesses and disabilities a secret
when they can, i guess
yeah, probably
any kind of way they'd try to keep it a secret would likely lead to conjecture or questions, but people wouldn't know for sure
having it declared in such a straightforward fashion is totally different
i wonder if it's more or less ironic
like, what proportion of those posting this stuff genuinely believe they're cursing him with it
there has to be at least one
this next month is going to be the longest of our lives
for americans at the very least
and if trump is voted out, then the next two months will be exceptionally dangerous

<@!184545248930693120> yes it is
huh? huh? huh??
eh i got bored with it
i'll put it back on for halloween proper
when in doubt, fuck work
who on earth would be qualified to be PR here
holy shit guys t's happening
IT'S HAPPENING
<:makinSmush:347205248802095105>
god, that tweet gnawms posted makes me feel so angry
like, of course that's the case
how are people this dumb
ree ree REE REE
vaping isn't lame so much as it is obnoxious
i don't tend to notice vaping often but when i do it's always, always some sweaty overweight unkempt neckbeard who takes a hit from it like four times in five seconds
and then blows the smoke cloud out in a way that makes it as visible as possible
that last bit doesn't sound very important, i don't know how to describe it
it's just fucking
god
so awful to witness
i'll be sure not to cast curses in trump's direction
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that's fucking horrible
the energy from his seed is used to power the curse i guess
it's still like... purposeful, but i guess
i don't know, it's definitely "what the fuck are you doing dude" tier
i guess the kindest thing i can say about it is that it's 4chan levels of "i can't believe what the fuck i'm witnessing"
that's the kind of thing i would have seen on /b/ in 2006 and laughed
oh god, i don't want to know what kind of blood that is
also is that text supposed to mean or look like anything
or is it just random scribbling
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i mean, i guess i'm not one to talk since i literally made a pagan shrine a couple weeks ago
that rat is enormous, holy shit
we should put all the meme animals together and make a sitcom out of it
"Hey Beeger, how are you doing to--" "BARKBAKARBKRABAKRBKARBKRABKRBK"
i think beeger would eat a human
EAT THE RAT!
```2nd of October
EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE RAT! EAT THE```
alright i draw the line at geeseposting
<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
i mean, it's not like it matters much
i just wrote a small essay about how i feel about game grumps
couple years ago or so
nah tips
it fell under 2000 and hasn't come back up since yesterday i think
it was at 1950 when i checked before
it's at 1961
was it? i read it and then it was immediately deleted from my memory
i just said that tips
anyway i think she means busted as in how it treats content creators
MIYAGI-SENSEI
WAX ON WAX OFF WAX ON WAX OFF
_crane kick_
yeah apparently trump is actually symptomatic according to NYT and his presidential aides
i mean, this is a really bad time to be sick for trump in particular, because he's behind significantly in the polls and this would interrupt his campaign schedule
it's already erasing two weeks from his schedule if he adheres to quarantine, if he's symptomatic he could be sick for an indeterminate amount of time
tipsy, i don't know how to tell you that the presidential candidates go and have physical rallies before election day
this usually bolsters their polling numbers
if trump can't do that, it hurts his campaign
althoguh maybe not given how entrenched everyone already is
oh no
i mean, i love cobra kai, but it's not a concept that can realistically last too long
3 seasons would have been perfect
yeah i actually considered making that bet with misha but on the off chance i lose i can't afford to just piss out 50 bucks
wait, why am i restricting myself to larger amounts of money
<@!207991389613457408> things are significantly up in the air that i want to make that bet with you, but small cash only
how does 10 bucks sound
sweet
yep
if he wins, i win
if you were here i would spit in my hand and offer it for a shake
presidentpool
i'm keeping track of the bets
FREE JUST EAT PIZZA
<@!207991389613457408> one of us in a month's time:
we should have betting pools more often, this is fun
even if it's just petty cash
can i put you down for that cy
we'll argue about it when the time comes
i'll take you up on that moonjail, i don't think anyone will be impeached in the next two years
any _president_
well, okay
we could try making the bets more fun
if trump wins i'll shove a fat husky up my ass
it adds to the spirit of the occasion
anyway, just let it be known that if you make a bet with someone in here, let me know so i can record it and hold the people involved accountable
fine by me cy
god, the end of an era
one more piece of evidence on the pile showing that homestuck is a dying property
yeah, is it possible that someone else could host the servers instead
do you think at some point sakurai just had his head down, in his hands, as he contemplated his life
he's got you there
isn't rick moranis kind of an asshole
also man i hope you suceed at keeping pesterchum up
it is a priceless relic at this point
i think it should be a sign to anyone with half a brainstem, if you hate what someone works on purely because of who the author is
i mean i don't know, i don't pay attention
also i realize that previous statement could come across as hypocritical but i think it's important to point out the distinction between someone's identity and their character
before i get screenshotted by any dumbass spies in here
can't believe i have to prime my statements for stuff like this but i'm sure they're around
i know right
<:KEKW:632036208750624799>
anyway
back to important things
imagine if makin _does_ iterate on pesterchum and make it even better
that'd be neat
that'd be pretty fun
um, excuse you, i'm pretty sure "world's worst goalkeeper" is _me_
bweeeeeeeeeeee
marginally increases chances of death
yeah, i think i'm officially on the "trump shouldn't die" train, if for no other reason than i think it would rob people of the potential for justice
i mean, no, just the inside of a prison cell
he probably deserves to live a while in extreme incarceration
there's minimal security prisons
you know what the sad part is
no matter how close trump comes to death, no matter how shitty the coronavirus might make him feel, he will never gain a shred of empathy for other people who have been infected by it
i don't know man
there's a lot of people out for his blood
pretty sure new york state at least has a slam dunk case prepared for the second he steps out of office
no one really, truly cares about clinton except for conspiracy theorists
not saying clinton isn't guilty of shit but the only people who are frothing at the mouth to get him in prison are legit right wing fringe lunatics
trump, conversely, has pissed almost everyone off
and has also been so fucking bad at covering up his incompetency and his crimes that it should be 100 million times easier to prosecute him
pls wales
i hunger
<@!205026834205769748> <:drewBitch:667945916128559125>
apparently trump is not only going to the hospital, they also injected him with an experimental antibody cocktail that doesn't have FDA approval
guess being the president has its perks

is pretty good ngl
fucking death
What?
What?
i didn't expect his condition to be this bad so soon
it's like 18 hours since he announced he has it
he's already been airlifted to the hospital
i don't really want him to die but it would be unbelievable, _cosmically_ hilarious irony for trump to die of a pandemic disease that likely wouldn't have been as bad under a clinton presidency
if trump dies due to coronavirus he basically killed himself
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
5 days is typical for detection after infection
3-7 days is the range
looks like a stinkbug
wait, that long antenna is pretty distinctive
god, i'm not an entomologist so i can't really say
sigh
oh yeah so it was

if he dies then the bets are null, right
15 dollar odds are pretty solid

this is one of those rare times i wish i had TV so i could continuously get news updates without having to check a variety of different pages
to whoever it was who told me the secret service are all on trump's side https://twitter.com/drewharwell/status/1312173491609690113
fuck you gnawms you're a wiener
hoaxing as bigfoot
why does this make me feel weird
and abel?
hwa
<@!273994148825268224> what is uhf
oh right
i don't know i'd be fine with watching it sometime
it seems pretty weird
that's... impressive
it's like that neverclick cookieclicker achievement
i guess if you view him like you would an animal at the zoo it makes sense
i kind of get where you're coming from tm
but i think it's more worthwhile to talk about that as a general effect and not like
how it's constrained within one particular individual
it's Good and Valuable to discuss how people can be radicalized into having these bizarre, backwards opinions
i think i agree here, looking at people like 0hp as anything more than a case study of mild interest is a mistake
it's unfortunate that people can turn out like this but it's not really the responsibility of any individual or group to try and prevent every twisted interpretation possible
what do you mean it's wrong git
i don't think it's that much of a leap in logic to say that people can react badly to what they perceive as gaps or inadequacies in any ideology
i think that statement is only true part of the time tm
there _might_ be interesting and important counterarguments but not all of them are
i think the distinction that's being made here is that 0hp's arguments do not count as interesting, or at the very least they are certainly unimportant
because they're clearly not based in reality and they're really quite inoperable in any sort of context that relies on interacting with other people extensively
^^^^^^^^
<@!125433170047795200> knock it off
NO
DO NOT POST ANYMORE
I ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE WHERE THIS ARGUMENT IS GOING
he has his warning
yeah, like i said tm
0hp might be _interesting_ as an isolated case study but his opinions are almost certainly unimportant in the larger scheme of things
don't mistake someone who is bizarre or curious for someone who is deserving of attention or real consideration
especially if they're peddling hostile rhetoric
so you're like, trying to advocate for picking and choosing the potential aspects of his arguments that have merit??
both are true
in order to start with any sort of figurative construction, you typically need to create a fundamental base for it
a lot of people don't bother with that part and just go with what they think feels right
god
too many things happened in the last three or four days, and now we're hitting a lag in the news updates
i'm starting to feel it like withdrawal
i need more _news_
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
anyway
please, the cult of personality can only manifest in one individual
enough of this
i die, marinette
<:pog:576614562598748213>
yaHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
man, the last couple days have been so weird
i feel like i'm waiting on tenterhooks to hear more news
the future is suddenly even more uncertain than it was before
truly the highest of aspirations
wow, what the fuck
there's a liltommyj game grumps remix in mouth dreams
i was NOT expecting to hear that
so the drilbot accoutn is curated, right
it still makes me laugh
well, if you're that concerned with the welfare of humanity and potential threats to it, i think that's a fine reason
such is the will of lit
where there's a will there's a way
```Neither What Pumpkin nor Viz Media would respond to requests for comment. Snake Solutions did respond to comment, but only to tell me to stylize Homestuck^2 as ‚Äúhomestuck 2‚Äù, which I am not going to do.```
this is interesting
not very interesting, but still
what the fuck does that even mean
like, what is the implication here
i wonder if this guy knows about the emails
not really relevant to this article, but might be something they want to know
"I do not recommend the average person read the leaked emails. It's part of a very different, very childish melodrama that falls far beyond the scope of this article." <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
how adroit
man, what an awful shitshow this has all been
like, stepping back, it feels like almost every single step of the way has been riddled by weird problems and disastrous results
you'd think they would have learned after a while not to do things in a shitty, clandestine way
just in case you didn't see it daniel, there was a spat update a few days ago
check the changelog
i don't know how it's possible that they bounced back and actually got act 1 released
it's going to take even longer to release act 2 somehow
wasn't tickets soon almost _two_ years ago at this point
<:GONE:696509069233487972>
i mean, why would they do that
they've made it abundantly clear that they despise the absolute shit out of their audience
it was speculated at around 1 million dollars
no idea if that's accurate though
ez lyfe
every time we get on this topic i can't help but think what a disaster this property is
i mean, it's a good synopsis, but i didn't get much new out f it
calling it a synopsis is probably too harsh, it's very in-depth
these vidsmiths work fast
the cat just killed my good redwood tree
i'm so fucking pissed off
i've been growing it from seed for four months and he used the pot as a fucking litterbox
this has been the worst shitfuck day
god i'm so fucking angry
i still have one giant sequoia seedling but it's not as healthy
four months of work down the fucking drain
i'm gonna shit
fuck this
no, he shit in the pot and dug it up with his claws
it's completely gone
dsdsafdsftgdsagsag
whatever
i hate animals
yeah? tell me about it
dude, that fucking sucks
i am so sorry to hear that
yeah, that sounds about right
i hope you'll get it back
bank fraud is devastating shit
anything essential?
jeez
how much are those usually
like USD?? that's about as expensive as it is for a bed frame here
well, nevermind, often they get up to around 200 bucks
do you mean like box springs? mattress?
yeah, the frame right
bed frames are pretty weird, i've never understood why people can't just put them on the ground
i guess the height has something to do with it
i would offer to get it for you but i'm not in a position to do that right now i'm afraid
how much is it
like one of those $5 hot wheels cars?
sure i'd get you that
i don't know, i haven't seen one in a while
like, for sale
nice
as it is nost, i'm wondering if i should go into detail about what happened today
i don't think that i should, some of it is really gross
probably to the point of being inappropriate for here
hey how about you shut the fuck up
the tree is part of it
i mean, i guess that part _is_ gross too
considering the cat shit in the pot and everything
but no, it's more about my job i guess
i'm basically an in-home caretaker for my grandmother now
i get paid for it but i've taken a cut below what's average wage for a caretaker here because my grandparents are poor
she's basically completely unable to do anything on her own, i'm sure i don't need to go into detail about what that means
it's just incredibly dispiriting to come home after earning my master's degree and start doing this instead
she's also becoming increasingly mentally deranged so she doesn't recognize me, and she's got a mean-streak in her so it's basically trying to ignore insults while performing all sorts of demeaning tasks
makes it hard to want to do anything
that's the worst of it really, the other stuff is just agitating
i went to go help my gf after work cuz her family is repainting their house to sell it
her sister was supposed to do some stuff but she fucked up so hard that my gf and i basically had to redo their part of the job completely
so i'm already pissed off from work and that, then i come home to find my tree turned into a litterbox
it's just one thing after another today dude
thanks for saying so
on the upside, after throwing the cat outside and calming down, i went looking for my tree and managed to find it
it wasn't buried too deep and everything aboveground seems intact, let me send a picture

i have no idea if this poor guy can be saved
the root system outside of that clump of soil is completely shredded, but i don't know how developed it was supposed to be at this stage anyway
i've replanted it as effectively as i can
if i had to guess it's just a matter of time before it dies
but maybe i'll be surprised and the sprout is more resilient than i fear
i still have the one other seedling that was untouched today but it doesn't look as good and i'm kind of jaded about the whole process now anyway
i'm proud that i was able to grow a couple of redwoods from seed to even this degree, it would have been nice to see them both reach maturity someday but i'm satisfied with my efforts and i'll just buy some more developed seedlings from a supplier if it comes down to it
that's interesting, usually bamboo drink water like nobody's business
must not have been able to develop roots first
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> well there's your problem
nah, there has to be some drainage
there are very few plants that can survive in a soupy mud environment like that
that's pretty sweet
i've wanted to try growing bamboo for a while, it's useful for some home projects
i'm too lazy to find a patch at a botanical garden though, i would probably order some seeds online
you've also reminded me that i wanted to try growing sugar cane to harvest my own sugar at some point
and cocoa trees too
our class grew flowers, but i got kicked out of that lesson
i was bored and did the thing where you stick a pencil on the side of your desk and strike it really fast with your hand so it goes flying of
teacher bitched me out for it, basically said "well if you're so bored you can GET OUT"
yeah it's like a weird catapult
shit just launches into space
yeah, in that case you need to supply more force to get it off the table, but the result is greater distance
no yeah i was a shitty kid in a lot of ways
like, honestly i sucked really hard
it wasn't until college and especially graduate school that i started paying better attention to how i was affecting other people and what kind of person i wanted to be
i'm speaking generally you fucking simian
mhm
that lesson came for me much later
in my sophomore year of college i think
i was and probably still am not good at understanding people
i'm ashamed of how long it took me to be more conscientious of others
i was just referencing my particular situation
no matter how you slice it, it's a hard lesson to learn
the realization that you've hurt someone without meaning to?
yeah, same
i struggle with that feeling every day
sorry you gotta deal with it too
alright, enough sad hour
DUNC-A-KINO
fuck you!
yeah, it's not as abused as we feared it might be
surprisingly appropriate
jesus
that's quality
don't you ever just wanna go apeshit?
yeah
but keep in mind pulp fiction is from the 90s
'94
inflation probably makes that 5 dollar shake more like...
that's pretty expensive
i would never order a shake for 9 dollars
lat 9 dollars for a fucking milkshake is outright bougie
that's outrageous
especially for a shitty country diner
no matter how themed it is
yeah, you see?
YOU SPEAK OF WHAT YOU KNOW NOT, YOUNGLING
i wonder what you'd think of it
lat is just an anomaly
i've stopped wondering about his strange ass opinions
done
did they ever release the butthole cut for cats
cowards
solid fuel builds are fun
extremely chaotic, but fun
i want to land on the moon with solid fuel at least once
p-i-z-z-a p-ar-t-y
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> jesus fucking christ
is the 3090 really all it's cracked up to be
that's what i figure, so why are people trying to shove it so far up their ass
well is the 3080 worth it then
this is fucking wonderful
what even is
unfortunately this has spoilers for games i intend to play, mostly metal gear
i will avoid it for now
thanks 4 link tho
pretty close actually
i want to do kotor2 after i'm done with the comics and then i don't remember anything else i had in the way
biggest challenge will actually be getting the games to run
i really do need to play them, huh
i just keep thinking of NANOMACHINES, SON
we're an achewood server now
didn't you know
bwee
did i miss anything
i guess not since trump is apparently still alive
i say "apparently" because we have no real way of knowing right now
mmh
you're probably right
the most bizarre thing was him going on his motorcade mini-rally earlier today
reportedly he was on dexamethasone when he did the motorcade stunt
that stuff is apparently only used in case of emergencies, because otherwise it actually makes people even more sick
it also apparently causes intense mood swings and also makes the user feel much like they would during a manic episode

https://twitter.com/HayesBrown/status/1312906619148267521
it's disingenuous to say he directly, personally caused 200k deaths but i feel pointing that out takes away from the fact that his lack of leadership and purposeful downplaying of the seriousness of it has caused way, way more damage than might have been suffered overall
it's much easier to forgive a few unpreventable deaths than it is to forgive an incredible amount of preventable deaths
that's a green screen
is it that important a difference though?
the salient point is that trump fucked up big time and has caused an absurd amount of deaths through his negligence that otherwise wouldn't have happened, probably
god]
it's technically accurate but calling donald trump charismatic makes my skin crawl
i still struggle with the idea that there are people who find him appealing in some way or another
the dude is like transparently awful in almost every way imaginable
i don't think it's funny lat
i take the matter of who's president seriously enough that it's just outrageously irritating
even if it wasn't for that, yeah, trump goes for a lot of low blows in order to "win" the debate by sheer assholery
i mean, if we're considering it a debate then strictly speaking neither of them won, because it was an absolute shitshow that doesn't deserve to be called a discussion
it was one person screaming constantly over the other person, and the latter getting frustrated to the point of retaliation
this isn't much different from how we've always done things to be honest
i'm fond of wanking over the past but don't make it out to look like we were really any cooler than we were before
more like 75+ people
at various times
get out
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> THAT went out the window
BOO TO THAT
IT MUST BE
gen has been getting quieter for a couple months
it's not a good thing
i think it's a bit of both lat
school has been kicking people's asses, especially with all of the weirdness with online stuff
it's only allowed as long as i say it is
i do, sir
i do
isn't the oven dead
that's what happens when you make splinter servers out of spite
visual novel
JANNIES
CLEAN
IT
UP
ah, i kind of feel you there sattie
don't worry, we typically have extremely thick skin here
it's part of being here
you learn to dish out discourse and take it in turn
it's good for the soul
oh <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
speaking of polls
what happened to the fandom census
did we ever get those results
what a mess
the day homestuck shanananananananan'd was when it died
of course homestuck 2 is for veterans of the franchise
it's completely incomprehensible for newcomers
is it possible for anyone to remotely contend otherwise
yeah but that's nepot--ah who cares
it's not like homestuck matters anymore
i don't plan on resuscitating the minecraft server in full until the caves and cliffs update comes out, cuz that looks like a huge game changer for the gameplay loop
i mean, not totally, but at least in terms of resource gathering
once that happens i'll create a new server
as it is, the old one is still up
ask nat for details
umbra we've done that before
it died in like a week
last year sometime
2b2t's interesting specifically because it's achieved widespread notoriety, and it attracts all sorts of weird people who end up doing weird things on it
there are probably five million 2b2t clone servers that no one knows or cares about, because they never became popular and no one does anything interesting with them
"already" we've played on modded servers like four times now
at various points
well what was special about my first server
people just built whatever they wanted
we had griefing turned on at first and people kept setting houses on fire and shit like that
it was sometimes done in the off hours
among us was released 2 years before it achieved such widespread popularity
it's not more popular than ss13 because it's accessible, it's more popular by chance
<@!205026834205769748> i've been busy with real life stuff to the point that i have no motivation to organize things
i'm currently struggling just to figure out how to do 10/25
figure it out yourself if you want things done
what are you talking about
who is mitch
oh my god this is magic the gathering shit
OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT
just kidding this is interesting
dunc
bwee
mekton sounds like a fun experience
oh yeah, i forgot i picked up hades
i should play that sometime, probably after MGS
nah, fuck that
i want the full experience
what's the point of playing a hard game if you turn on shit that makes it easier
that's right, i'm one of _those_ people tipsy
YOU NOT ONLY CHEATED THE GAME, YOU CHEATED YOURSELF
other people can do what they want, i'm trying not to be some elitist prick about it
i just don't find it personally satisfying
it took me something like 50-60 hours to beat noita for the first time
it was like scratching the biggest itch when i succeeded
uh
i don't know how to answer that question tipsy
noita is, by my understanding, kind of like hades
there's not much being "good at it"
you have to be lucky or you will most likely fail
okay then, i have no idea how hades works
i've never played it
everytime the rogue/roguelike/roguelite conversation comes up i just think of that gif of thanos doing the fortnite dance
BOO TO THAT
how can you tell a robot's ass is bad?
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
qweq, this was a fucking delightful conversational derailment
you are just jealous because you are sad
"that doesn't make sense"
neither does your face
oh, the roguelite stuff? yeah we're done with that
now it's all about asses and robots and achewoods
every lit regular being airdropped into a real life battle royale when
what's this dude
has anyone pointed out that at some point about 7 hours ago, trump apparently got his phone back and vomited all over twitter
there's like 20 tweets that are all literally "[RANDOM POLITICAL BUZZWORD]. VOTE!"
dexamethasone causes unbelievable mood swings and feelings of euphoria, also makes the recipient feel like they're full of energy
it's used to reduce inflammation in the lungs, caused by damage from covid
krato can never have a profile picture
it is forbidden
lat and misha made a bet
there's an extensive betting pool going o now
somewhere in the hundreds of dollars
he loses the bet, he said at some point
one can only hope
<:waitwhat:316648744579760128>
who says it wouldn't be
you guys realize that a death to underlying causes exacerbated by covid-19 is essentially death due to covid-19 right
hamberders*
"i don't think post-covid damage would change those odds dramatically enough"
clearly you are unaware of just how extensively coronavirus can damage someone
but it's not my bet, so i can't care too much
t-there is now
yes, that is one major way people die from the disease
covid-19 itself is not, to my understanding, the thing that directly kills people, it's the fact that it becomes insanely dangerous in combination with other risk factors
lat there are small-sized oxygen tanks that are designed to fit under coats and stuff
not a far-fetched idea
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
trump just--yeah
he 100% tweeted that to force his doctors' hands
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313186529058136070?s=20
"Don't be afraid of Covid. Don't let it dominate your life."
what a piece of shit
there goes the vague hopes that he might have learned something about empathy from this experience
republicans have already latched on to the messaging that getting covid makes you "a warrior"
i'm not making this shit up
imagine him leaving today and then having to be wheeled back in on a stretcher later this week
yeah it's great
i almost wanted to pin it but it's not relevant to us enough
i also want to point out that trump "feeling better than he did 20 years ago" is probably the steroids
that dude is going to crash tomorrow
it's dexamethasone, the side effects include feelings of euphoria and strength
<:GONE:696509069233487972>
why would you do that to yourself
yeah they literally said that in the review
"this movie isn't even entertainingly bad, like so bad it's good, this movie is at best interesting as an examination of bad film-making"
something along those lines
silence, wench
that could have been his name instead and it would change nothing, it's just as silly
Money Plane.
Bunch of bitches.
what is that a reference to
crystal society is a pretty solid shill but we don't talk about it much
i'm not sure why
good decision
whoa, what the fuck
10 months??
oh man, have fun with _that_ bullshit
uh
okay, so
i just finished higurashi for the first time like a week ago or so
i'm told umineko is better than that
i loved higurashi once i properly got into that
ever17 on the other hand made me want to shit blood
I'd rather not
Insubordination
i fucking hate his guts
what an entitled piece of shit
i almost wish he would die expressly so he would stop spreading this dangerous, harmful bullshit
almost
he still needs to be alive so he can get kicked the fuck out and sent to jail
the chances are slim but death is too good for him
isn't there that tenet in rationality that says it's better to get rid of someone who will certifiably cause a large amount of suffering and deaths
trump immediately took his mask off at the white house despite being EXTREMELY infectious right now
god, i'm fucking seething that someone this horribly selfish and uncaring exists
and he's the leader of our country
it's going to give me an aneurysm if i keep thinking about it
john mcafee apparently got arrested today
tax evasion
i was going to post more political crap but nevermind, you guys look like you're doing alright
bambosh i'm just looking at videos of him standing back near the white house and struggling to breathe
it looks _painful_
look at this shit https://gfycat.com/snoopyglossyantlion
this looks like my other grandma before she died, when she was really suffering from her COPD and needed oxygen
he's probably hopped up on steroids
god
i hate it, but i almost feel _bad_ for him
like, i imagine it's the kind of feeling when i'm choking on my drink and i'm just struggling to get air in
that sensation of drowning
how's that 5D crystal memory coming along
spelunky looks fun, if frustrating
the kind of game i'd want to stream
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
he is
it's basically saying "you are not held liable for stuff people post on your website"
yeah unironically
yeah
trump is probably still being pumped full of steroids
he's the president he can demand anything he wants
you have, that's how it works in here
nooo
no no no no never milk ape

<@146014279529791488> roland emmerich is a harbinger of fucking terribly written movies, who piggybacks off the success of stuff like independence day
It's really not THAT big of a deal unless you care about a smartly written plot
If you do, then its complete shit almost every time
I haven't seen it in forever so I don't  remember independence day very well, I do recall enjoying it
Seeing Dennis Quaid in it now is probably pretty weird considering he put out that tape of him fucking his wife in the ass with the picture of a universal studios exec taped over her face
Yeah randy, sorry
Why was I thinking dennis
Is there even a dennis quaid
Oh yeah, also an actor
I feel less bad about the mixup

cheat code i mean
we need an arquiusbot function that randomly all-bans one person in the server everyday for 24 hours
it's time to go all-in on cruelty
straight to hell, boyz
ye
when is it out
WHAT
WHAT THE FUCK
yes... YES...
this is what i needed in my life
he has good taste for a 2 year old
YEP
apparently trump has been roid rage tweeting all day, over 200 tweets in a 24 hour span, lmao
if it weren't so frightening, i would find his complete lunacy hilarious
also not surprising, /r/conservatives doesn't have a _single_ mention of his health or the cancellation of stimulus talks
that sub needs to get revamped hard
well, he said he wouldn't do it at first, but then he sent tweets about nancy pelosi saying "IF THEY SEND ME A STAND ALONE BILL FOR A $1,200 STIMULUS I'LL SIGN IT"
"RIGHT NOW"
who knows if that's another lie
i think there's some organization you can notify and be like "hey i haven't gotten my shit yet"
it already is
uh

sir this is an arby's
all i wanna do
uh
no
i did not

real audio taken from goku's fight with frieza https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e62M-5-7ajY
probably some shit like "intermixed faith with science" or something
yeah
they had charles shrink down to microscopic size and talk with some
and then he ended up shrinking _further_ and talking to some fictional subset of mitochondria called farandolae or something
many such cases!

we need a last movie for the 10/25 stream
optimally something halloween related
"hey kids we're gonna watch jack and jill for our 10/25 stream"
"i hope you like blatant corporate advertisements"

i miss when the internet was still a relative unknown so shit like that happened, instead of the weaponization of tribal mentality

LIFT-OFF! AAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHA
desperately waiting for kotor2 to finish downloading so i can resume playing new content
i can feel myself stagnating as we speak
not yet
eventually
apparently it's not as good
i need to check it out but other people have been doing that for me
sir this is an HSD
... the rat from ratatouille??
<@!120187484863856640> trump is hopped up on steroids and likely will be for most of this week, if you treat anything he says with even vague seriousness then you are a fool
because i am a fool
game recognize game
i'll believe it when i see it
he also cancelled and then resumed and then probably re-cancelled and re-resumed the stimulus bill
i've decided: our third halloween movie will be ryan's babe, the scariest movie of all time
YOU APPEAR TO HAVE A LITTLE _BABY_ INSIDE YOUR _BODY_
vice-presidential debate tonight at like... 9 PM EST or some shit
also how's project x coming along minty
<:pog:576614562598748213>
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> holy fuck
glad it's going well
yeah, i've been avoiding asking specifically cuz i know university is probably even more murder than usual this semester
i'm glad you've got some room to breathe at least, take your time and do what works for you
yeah i commissioned mint to turn me into a vocaloid
i'm vocaloid linky
yeah now i actually... kind of want that
it sounds dumb as fuck but hilarious
i was literally about to say like "i'm worried they actually believe us"
holy shit, utau linkybot
it's perfect
holy shit
guys, something serious just happened
hold on let me grab a screenshot

THANKS!
dude, this picture is so stupid, but i can't stop smiling at it, it's making my cheeks hurt

god, this month is going to be fucking devastating on my sleep
i'm refreshing 538 multiple times an hour for news
i'm deeply invested in the outcome of the election and i'm addicted to seeing developments one way or the other
the one who isn't treating coronavirus like it's nothing
i still don't agree with your premise that both of them are functionally the same in general, but even if i did, that _one thing_ by itself should be enough to make you shut the fuck up about equivocating them
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i need to see this

fucking wonderful
"i'm in"
oh no
we're approaching the catboy singularity
my beard is increasingly unkempt as we go through the year
i haven't had a haircut since june
i don't plan on shaving until after winter, unless it just gets that bad
i'm going to come out of htis looking like a fucking caveman
WHAT YEAR IS IT
strictly speaking i think this is the longest my hair has been in a few years
it's not quite "halal" long but it's definitely up there
maybe if i let my hair grow out long enough i can start rocking some gaelic cuts instead of cutting it back short
already done boss
she's called fluttershy and she makes me dinner after work
no relation to fluttershy the pony
you're doin' me proud linkybot
also b3es i meant celtic hairstyles i guess
nah, they wear their hair long and often with specifically styled braids
i was joking
also i have _really_ curly beard hair but it's straight otherwise
do NOT use vegetable oil on your electric razor
i don't know if it would actually damage it but that sounds like a fucking recipe for disaster
you should stick to mineral oils only
>35 dollars for a haircut
what the fuck kind of barber are you going to
i got a full shave regularly at graduate school for 15 bucks
fuck styling
fuck aesthetic
primitivism only
if i can't peacefully look like a chad-magnon then i don't want to live on this planet anymore
i have long wanted to live in a cabin in the woods by myself so that is perfectly fine
i will recede from society and become the woodsman i have always desired to be
i'd rather piss glass than talk to people
people are the enemy
<:UNRELENTINGTRASH:456927328929316865>
IT'S TOO LATE
but nah i'm exaggerating
obviously
i do want some space for myself, i've always preferred living in the country to more populated areas
my eventual goal is to save up enough money for a smallish plot of land, build a humble cottage
save up enough money to live on interest
that's all i want
i'm no city slicker i don't need much
i say as i relentlessly use the internet and my gaming PC i built myself
communes are for cults and suckers

i think we're going to do the nic cage lovecraft movie that came out recently
it feels like a decent blend of horror and vaguely homestuck adjacent material
not a definitive decision though

wait, is aysha really talking on rev's stream
have to admit i didn't see that one coming
weird move to try and stay relevant but alright
well, that they are
yeah, who would do _that_
üôÑ
those fucking star wars fans, caring about \*checks notes\* integrity and consistency
you don't even try, apparently
i'm sure she's stressed as fuck trying to manage things
bizarre, also yes it is
at least she's trying though, it's good to see _someone_ on the official team positively interacting with fans
broke: bizarre
woke: bizzare
bespoke: bazarr
yeah, hussie is supposedly out of the picture, so the director is like the next progression of self-inserts that loosely do and do not affect the plot
it was okay, i felt like the execution could have used some finagling but there were other parts of the last episode that bugged me way worse
especially in a holistic sense
well, publicly anyway

it's been 11 years since the accident, wake up
<@!131650004606648320> no

it's been creeping back in and i'm annoyed by it
why wouldn't it be
it's a pretty recognizable graphic without being The Symbol
don't see a problem making it a central icon
oh, well, sure, that's always an option

i'm doing nothing of value with my time right now
maybe i should go grab some dinner**dinner**
yep that's what i'm gonna do brb suckers
thank god, it IS boring
i was worried it would somehow be exciting
yeah, here's a youtube link
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65twkjiwD90
yeah, he's also actually well-spoken
pence apparently ran a radio show for years and knows how to phrase things in a way that isn't batshit
CUT HIM OFF
CUT HIM OFF
HAVE SOME FUCKING BALLS, DEBATE MODERATORS
yeah, it's unusual having a return to normalcy after a complete shitshow
CUT HIM OFF
GOD DAMN IT
CUT HIM OFF
I'M SO FUCKING PISSED OFF
HAVE SOME BALLS
no, they apparently didn't
it's not a shitshow, it's just that they aren't enforcing _time limits_
pence keeps speaking over his time limit and going ON for seriously like two minuts
they need to start enforcing those limits
n-no, what
i'm starting to remember why people say "pence scares me more than trump"
trump is like unveiled, blatant crazy
pence is like subdued and gentle about it, it's very insidious
he's also getting really good soundbites out in full hypocrisy like it's nothing
ah yes, he's pushing swine flu
people on reddit were predicting this
pence is a good orator, he's a terrible person
and then they interrupt anyway
hilda has some extremely good moments in it, which is nice because it's already a consistently solid show
the hill giants episode is one of my favorites of any cartoon series ever
taylor swift endorsed joe biden today, so that's cool
i'm not being sarcastic, i'm just saying that's cool
it's good that people who aren't dinosaurs are getting politically involved

here it comes
i'm voting for taft
essentially yes
just take a look at trump's twitter for the last two days
it's a fucking mess
it's like if my mom were a presidential candidate, except she was high on pain killers the entire time
it is, yes
but it's also just like an exacerbation of what he always does anyway
he always does this kind of thing, even if just to a lesser degree
i'm about to do what's called a "pro-politician move"
sabotage, also yeah i think so
he hasn't brought that up in a while
but it was a huge deal in the first year or two of his presidency
"OBAMA WIRETAPPED ME"

<@!207991389613457408> i'm late but `do you want moderately better old man or accelerationist hit the shit pedal man`
i was thinking about this for a bit
i'm really, really tired of having conversations _like_ this, _about_ this
going back a little bit and occupying a little more comfortable territory is kind of necessary for most people i think
i've gotten so exhausted just trying to _keep up_ with everything
i'd like to stay informed but not to the point of exhaustion
give me a scandal like once a year
not every day
fascinating, isn't it
it's so boring that i don't feel compelled to keep watching
i mean, doesn't help that it's the VP debate and not a presidential one
no one gives a shit about the VPs
he's been doing that for every fucking question
<@!301623473959337984> what the fuck does that even mean
no you dingus
i mean about chris wallace wanting to touch joe biden's leg hair

that's about it
i don't think there's anything in that game that's called "dirt" or "soil"
fuck is you on
oh, it's just "powder"
powder toy is a different deal
`no`
i'm not sure how i feel about the fact that trump made me forget what it's like to see someone speaking who is smooth and subtle about lying
pence is an outright slimy motherfucker, he makes my skin crawl
you don't need to correct that, it was boring to the extreme
if you want the spicier details, kamala harris "attacked" pence around 85 times and interrupted him 8 times; pence attacked her around 95 times and interrupted her 16 times
the moderator sucked pence's dick by allowing him to ramble and steamroll harris, harris didn't really come across too strong
that's basically it
let me know when you wake up from your coma
apparently danny trejo is 76 years old? how the actual fuck is that possible
he looks like he's in his early 50s _at most_

glad to be of service
or you could not do that and be a decent human being
there are decent people in here
almost every fucking person in here is decent, are you some kind of contrarian twit who insists that anyone who isn't perfectly good is automatically bad
literally every single person i can think of who uses this channel qualifies as a "decent person"
some of them are good and a few even qualify as "great"
i'm not gonna do this semantic bullshit right now
as soon as makin takes the server back i'm resigning

but life won't let me sleep
just let me languish in early-onset senility
i'll hold you up on a spork, prick

anyway, i meant what i said
i doubt there's more than one or two people who are regs here that could be considered anything less than "decent"
decent is not a high bar to reach
And yet!
<@!227181775221161984> SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT THE FUCK UP
i just wanted to go on my spiel
i take specific offense to implications that people here are generally bad
i like the people here a lot, sue me
i like the taste of carrot cake well enough but i hate the shit out of the bits of actual carrot and raisins (????????????) that people bake into them
what the fuck is this

shut up music people
there are many things i don't know about still
oh
well, that's unfortunate
time to keep listening to the music, not like i give a fuck about the dude himself
it does matter
i'm just annoyed at the non-specific incorrectness
????????
what the fuck are you talking about
do you even know what a radical feminist is
i can't believe this garbage i'm reading
i'm going to break this down VERY simple-like
from the top
feminism is a school of thought that seeks to empower women, radical feminism is a subschool positing that society as we have it now is fundamentally incapable of enabling women to be empowered, such that women must seek to create their own spaces and power structures, TERFs are radical feminists that don't think trans women should be included in those spaces for biological reasons
among others
^
it would help if you didn't view TERFs as a monolithic entity that all believe exactly the same things
this is a common problem in discussing identity politics, i'm endlessly frustrated with the fact that there are divisions in thought between various philosophies that can then be broken down into like five different levels of subphilosophies
it's like there is no cohesion at all and everyone believes a different version of similar things
makes it impossible to actually try and get anything done
no, that is completely incorrect lat
if there is ONE thing that i'm firm on when it comes to discussions like this, it's on a fundamental separation between sex and gender
they can and do operate independently of each other even if they sometimes inform each other
well
sex informs gender, not the other way around
well, we're not about to abolish sex anytime soon, i don't know what to tell you there
pretty sure at some point discourse had gotten to that point of "sex and gender are separate but related qualities" but then it fucking spiraled into madness in the last few years
i was just about to mention that tera
wait
no, GNC has nothing to do with what i'm talking about
i thought you were going to bring up the common counterpoint of people without firmly male/female sex characteristics
is intersex still a socially acceptable term
i literally cannot keep up with the rate of discourse
alright
you know what
despite the fact that i literally took a course in sexual genetics when i was in undergraduate school and am thus literally qualified to talk about it to some degree, i have a feeling that nothing i say would be satisfying, so i'm just not gonna get into it
this isn't my fight, i'm tired
i'm not going to sleep yet probably, thoguh i should
i'm just pissed that where identity politics currently are has rapidly outpaced my ability to constructively contribute to it
it makes no sense to me anymore for the most part
apparently not, because we talk about them nearly every fucking day
but i can't be mad about that, it's important to try and figure yourself out
being generally disgusted with the human body? i think that's fairly common, if not a particularly strong feeling in most people
i feel disgusted by biology sometimes, but it's a very muted feeling
usually drowned out in fascination, it's why i became a biologist
most of my feelings about transhumanism is more about the end product or the functionality of it
i have often thought about the desire to become a robotic being, but it's not because i dislike being human
i don't dislike the human aesthetic
i just worry about fucking dying
i'd rather be in a form that's more easily maintained with greater longevity
it doesn't matter what that form _is_
just keep me from rotting
like cognitive/physical therapy? relearning your sensations and interactive skills?
that's just asking to get overthrown by your mind copies
man thinking about it though, i barely enjoy being alive already
why would i create a clone of myself that has to live forever
that'd be torture
SHI
P
OF
THESEUS
i mostly entertain the idea of stopping time when i feel really stressed out by life
like when i had major deadlines in school coming up i fantasized about having a hyperbolic time chamber where everything outside of it is put on hold, and i can spend asm uch time as i want sleeping or preparing
i think that "replacing neurons" is a matter of how memories and cognitive processing work
memories and thoughts work because of establishing connections between various neurons, right
putting it very very loosely
you'd have to find a way to keep that process going and then effectively replicate it without damaging anything for all 86 some odd billion neurons in your brain
i don't find it hard to believe that consciousness is an emergent process that involves highly, highly complicated interactions between different "parts" of your brain
it's not difficult to piece these things together when you understand what each individual component involved does
a fully assembled computer seems like magic but when you understand what all of the individual parts in the chassis are and how they work, it's completely fine
for some reason people freak out and forget that brains are completely physical constructs, i think they're daunted by their enormous complexity and don't realize that it literally took 4+ billion years to get to this point essentially by chance
we're all just waiting with bated breath for the moment a computer is created that's better than us
what the fuck do you mean "why"
there is no why
it just happens
like i said, it's an emergent process
the universe doesn't care, it doesn't have to
the universe doesn't care about the fact that dense objects warp space and create a gravitational pull
it just happens as a result of the way the system works
as you say, it's all about how quarks interact with each other
like, i'm not sure what you're trying to suggest here
this is all perfectly in line with what i was saying
???
those two things aren't mutually exclusive
consciousness doesn't "matter," it's just something that happened to happen
tm, i think you might be confusing yourself by thinking too big to start with
the human brain is a pretty unique and complicated thing
start with something smaller, like a fucking flatowrm
c. elegans is a common model for studying neuronal function and it has a brain size of 300 neurons
scientists have managed to fully map and replicate the brain of c. elegans and literally put it into a robot
okay, so if you understand how the system works, then why are you caught on this
take c. elegans and extrapolate into more complicated structure and function
you're going from a very simplistic system of 300 neurons into a very complicated system of 86 billion neurons
they're both fully physical, fully corporeal systems that work within the confines of the rules of the universe
okay, then i'm going to take a break from yelling that i'm confused to let you explain what's going on
i still don't understand what your precise hangup is
what exactly are you trying to discuss here
i thought you were suggesting that consciousness as a process is so complicated that it has to have some kind of deeper meaning or purpose to it
WHAT?
what the fuck are you talking about jesse
are you literally trying to draw up conjecture about the operational meaning of what consciousness is
oh no, fuck this
i'm not entertaining this line of discussion
tm, you are massively overcomplicating shit yet again
tm, when you start talking in terms like that, i'm never sure if you're trying to muddy things on purpose or if you genuinely believe that overcomplicating them is useful
```if you don't massively overcomplicate things, all you are able to talk about is things that actually exist``` this is precisely what people should be discussing _in conversations about concrete constructs_
if you're talking about abstractions like philosophy then treat that on a separate basis from "how the brain works such that it provides consciousness"
if your axiom is that consciousness can't be treated as a process that arises from corporeal structures then we can't really continue this discussion
just because consciousness as an emergent process involves a lot of abstraction doesn't mean that consciousness itself is not a _physical_ process
clearly it must arise from somewhere
therefore it is able to be discussed in concrete terms
unless you're trying to suggest that consciousness is something innate to our brains, something greater than the sum of its parts, consciousness is just as physically oriented as any other part of our anatomy
if you start fucking with the CPU in a computer you fundamentally mess with its ability to carry out computations, even if those computations are abstracted
the point i'm trying to make here is that we're dealing with stuff that, while itself is an abstracted concept, arises from very physical things
so treating it as a legitimately abstract thing is fallacious
you cannot classify consciousness as an immaterial thing because it is a result of material processes
tm doesn't apparently
whatever
i'm giving myself 10 minutes to listen to tm's rebuttal and also talk about something else
i have two bottles of wine i was gifted by my gf's parents for helping them move into a different house
one of them is a 2011 dessert eiswein from germany, the other is a 2009 red wine from the sturgis motorcycle rally
which one should i celebrate with if trump stops being president
<@!273994148825268224> you have 7 minutes
anyway if trump becomes president again i give up
i thought the whole point of mastodon was that servers were able to be hosted individually, what is this shit about admins reporting different servers
this sounds like discord but with extra steps
i guess my point is that i'm not sure why there's interactions between different servers
what's the point of having people spread out over multiple servers if they're all going to associate with each other anyway
... okay? so then what happens if people from all the different servers start to disagree with each other
does it just fucking split apart
this sounds really, really fucking stupid
this sounds like how germany or italy operated before unification
tenuous connections built up until something happens that causes shit to splinter apart
it sounds needlessly chaotic and like it would significantly hinder the development of a proper community
tm that's an intractable problem, operationalizing _anything_ in the natural world runs the risk of excluding certain things that might fit because of various factors we can't keep in mind because we're imperfect beings
using that as an excuse to tiptoe around the idea is backwards and not useful
what you do is operationalize things and then adjust your definition of stuff as your understanding of it improves
that's how science works
tl;dr stop being a philosophical pussy
so fucking operationalize it and then improve your definition of what consciousness is as you learn more about it
this isn't hard, it just takes effort
get your head out of the fucking rhetorical sand
again, start with something and iterate on it as you learn more
what you begin with is probably not going to be great but this is like some kind of chicken and egg thing you're pushing
you need to start somewhere
what you're suggesting is like informational paralysis
"we need to start somewhere!" "but we don't know where to start!" "but we need to start somewhere anyway!"
even if the first iteration of your knowledge isn't good, you start there anyway and try to get better as fast and accurately as possible
by whatever metrics you can find
christ i hate philosophy
it's a bunch of sophist wankery without any actual progress towards finding a real solution or understanidng
thank god the scientific process was developed and we can actually, y'know, make observations about the natural world
okay, again, it seems we're running up against each other in a fundamental way
you're positing that a thing such as a "true truth" can actually exist
i do not believe that
what would that even mean
it's a distraction at best, at least from our current understanding of the universe
devote your energy and processing power towards actually working out physical processes and then maybe we can start worrying aobut a "greater truth"
no
that's now how that works
"truth" as a universal abstraction is what i'm suggesting is false here
this is fundamentally different from "physical reality"
if i can hold something in my hand it's real
that doesn't make it "true"
"true" is a human concept that doesn't fit here
you're conflating concepts
if that's how you interpret physical reality or truth then we are never going to get ANYWHERE
i don't know
but this is why i purposefully ignore the concept of "true existence" because it needlessly overcomplicates stuff that we can see with our own eyes
i'm staring at my computer screen that actually exists and i use for specific purposes
this stuff exists regardless of the philosophical connotations you're trying to suggest here
i don't care about the larger existential ramifications of this or how to effectively connect them with each other
the fact remains that we are here and we can observe things
from that platform by itself we can learn more things, even if where we start from is more arbitrary than less
if _you_ want to inject pointless complexity by saying it's impossible to gauge whether things "truly exist" then fine by me, but i don't want to hear about it
it's fucking frustrating
more important than the possibility of conjecture here is that i don't fucking care
what am i even supposed to do with this information
tm, i'm trying to indicate that i'm not really interested in you pointing out conflicts in my framework because so far it's done a pretty good job servicing me as i go about the world and do things
i'm going to recontextualize this discussion so you can understand why i'm frustrated
because i stick my cock in dirt, let's call me a green wizard
i deal with life and the stuff that falls under that category
i work my magic to grow fruit and veggies and i understand how the tree grows, and what makes it grow well
you're a white wizard trying to assault that understanding by saying it's impossible to know whether those plants are even real
when clearly i am working with this information that is physically existent
it's like some kind of intellectual aberration that makes no sense
i don't even know where to begin approaching that suggestion because it's fundamentally at odds with the very stuff i do on a daily basis
trying to make me call into question the fact that i exist and do things every day is very not-interesting to me because, regardless of what you say, i am RIGHT HERE
DOING THINGS
i can kind of see why that might interest you in terms of a logical or rhetorical debate but for me it's of fleeting interest at MOST
most of the time it's just irritating because it feels like a needless overcomplication of stuff that people do every day
i don't want to question this stuff because the subject matter is so cosmically unwieldy to address that it's basically impossible with our current understanding of things
okay, sure
when that day comes, i'll ask you for help
until then, we'll keep the straightjacket on you and keep you in your nice padded room
jokes aside, i guess what i'm trying to say is that your if is one unimaginably huge "if"
like, why would biology suddenly turn out to be smoke and mirrors
that kind of suggests that EVERYTHING would turn out to be smoke and mirrors
you're kind of forcing this premise on me that doesn't really jive with how we understand things to work right now
well shit tm, if it's already happened then i guess we'll just HAVE TO DO WHAT WE DID BACK THEN AGAIN
which is probably "start over"
that doesn't seem too hard to me in the grand scheme of things
it's almost like i addressed this by saying you need to operationalize something even if your operationalization is pretty bad, and then you iterate your definitions based on updated understanding
if something happens that somehow overturns all of our work then them's the fucking breaks
we just need to start over
i'm half an hour late but finally time to try and sleep
if i have dreams about this i'm going to fucking wipe out the concept of your existence tm
the platonic ideal of tm is half a turkey sandwich
why? i don't know, that's how philosophy works i'm pretty sure
then you do not belong in any science other than physics, and even that's pretty shaky
stick to math
anyway fuck philosophy, i sleep
talk to you non-physical entities later
why did you pin mine, dG's is much better
you'll neveri nhertit the servher hrurlike this sgs
<@!120187484863856640> yeah i actually really agree with that comic
there are too many people who say "why would you waste your time on smaller problem when bigger problem exists" without recognizing that incrementally solving smaller problems may actually make it easier or even just possible to solve the bigger ones
oh no, you said "probably"
you don't actually know you're just pulling shit out of your ass again
i'm not entertaining this discussion lalalalalalalalalalala
<@!731659650944073851> <a:what:504633866334765057> okay then, don't be weird

appropriate response
damn, shut down
that's why i got those episodes up the other day
it's an experience in mental whiplash
i wouldn't mind it, but people were bitching that it'd be too long or something
also there are already people streaming shit throughout the week
complain to makin and or misha

okay, so
i'm playing CK2 for the first time
i'm in the learning scenario but i don't really know what to do
i understand i can do anything i want really, but how do i begin expanding my claims
<@!155401695138938881> help me i am bab
<@!207991389613457408> i'm playing ck2 and just going through the learning scenario
just dicking around trying to get a sense of how things work
i just married "Ingegerd Haraldsdatter" from norway
current ambition is to have a son
oh shit lmao okay, i think i'm starting to see
i am the heir of my brother
so if i plot his death and i succeed in killing him, i'll get his kingdom
well, it's not like i've got anything else to do today
let's see how this turns out
oh, there's a revolt going on
can i suppress this manually or does it just resolve itself over time
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
this video is complete nonsense
also i don't know how to just plot to steal his title, it's not an option
do i have to lower his reputation somehow? not sure how i do that
tensei was right, this is overwhelming
you guys gotta slow down
oh, i see how members of my council can perform special actions
how do i improve my relationships with various council members
my chancellor and especially my marshal both hate me
oh that's right, i can give gifts
sorry i'm still getting used to the UI
there's a LOT of stuff here

"'i'm four down i can't believe it.' but they're fake news polls" try 10-20 points down buddy
trump's interview on sean hannity right now is fucking crazy
he's basically steamrolling over hannity, not answering questions, and is fucking ALL OVER the place
i think you can watch it here actually
https://ustv247.tv/foxnewslive/
holy shit he's talking about people trying to stage a coup over him or something
oh, i think it's over
because i'm morbidly curious about disasters
yeah it's over nevermind
at one point he started talking about the california wildfires and said "it's due to poor management" and "you flick a cigarette butt out and it all goes up in flames"in the same breath
he also said something about "getting all the water out into the ocean for the little fishies" and i have NO fucking clue what he was talking about
he also ended up coughing really hard a few times, going so far as muting himself on the phone so you couldn't hear it
so he's definitely really sick
i don't know, it was his usual brand of derangement
i can't say much more about it than that
fucking _nuts_ man
```"California is gonna have to ration water. You wanna know why? Because they send millions of gallons of water out to sea, out to the Pacific. Because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish, that aren't doing very well without water." -- Trump```
this is what the quote was
still no clue what he was saying
`Trump concludes his interview with Hannity by claiming that Mike Pence refusing to commit to a peaceful transition of power during the VP debate was his "best answer" of the night`
yes
fuckin wat

hm
i kind of feel you there, but not 100%
i'm also trying to be more active and am having some success
i go fishing with dero semi-regularly, and in fact was going to go tomorrow for a bit
but there are existent circumstances that reinforce the feeling of being a piece of shit
it's difficult to break out of the mind barrier for it
yeah, if discord is literally inhibiting you so much then it's better to just point blank get rid of it
as much as i use discord i can at least put it down
like, don't get me wrong, i've been where you are, with IRC
at my worst i used the #sydlexia IRC room literally for 12+ hours and couldn't stop, it got in the way of my studying and motivation to do things irl
yeah
ironically, i feel like my internet usage improved with the advent of more responsibilities
sometimes the only cure is life forcing you to fix your shit or else
but it sounds like you're making progress
dude, sometimes you just need to buckle down

<@!125433170047795200> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TklM2-lSby4
yeah, it's no coincidence that all of my interesting anecdotes are from real life
man, where did _your_ sense of ennui come from woc
i literally had that thought just the other day
then i got over it
woc is just mad that we banned gnawms cuz he was posting horny furry shit
woc's source of entertainment is gone so he's shitting
he'll be back in a week
get over it
if you think "adults talking about stuff" is boring then boy do i have bad news for you woc
that's literally everything
well what the fuck else are we supposed to talk about
sticking our thumbs up our asses?
you want me to try that out and report back with results?
none of us have anything interesting going on because we're all losers, and that's BEFORE you factor in covid-19 shutting stuff down

i'll give you three guesses

nope, that's one guess
here's another hint: children are the protags
nope, that's the second guess
one more try
you better not fuck this up qweq
what is it
tell the class
SAY IT
THAT'S RIGHT GUYS
WE'RE WATCHING CAT IN THE HAT WITH MIKE MYERS
truly the most disturbing movie of all time
pretty sure she's talking about freddy kreuger
nightmare in elm street yeah
i have to admit though, "cat in the hat" being called "nightmare hour" is not unfitting
okay, what the actual fuck, is discord breaking for everyone else too or is it just me
yeah guys totally
i was being 100% serious when i said we're watching cat in the hat, trust me
after all, what better halloween movie is there
very nice creature
<@!213413608732884994> i tried to be as sarcastic as humanly possible, i'm joking
we are not watching cat in the hat
I WAS ONLY PRETENDING
fuck this
we need a reckoning
but mouthjail i am le tired
well, it waits for me
at least... a couple of days
probably
get a thermos
i am my own water bottle
i've evolved skin pouches specifically designed to hold water
i absorb it through my dermis like a frog
downside? if i get too thirsty, i can't breathe properly
i hate you for saying this because it's absolutely correct
grab on to me charlie, we're gonna be alright
sometimes it's good to humble yourself, really lower your standing in the universe
forcing yourself to climb back up into graciousness is a useful way to remain modest
thanks vac, i can always never count on you
silence, this current topic displeases me
go back to tlaking about fake halloween movies
y'all ever seen disney's pinocchio
that shit is scary as _fuck_

yeah, i have to admit i was like super careful about the placement of my hands
a little bead of sweat falling down my temple
nope, that shit would be gone
i did it for the meme
oh man, the omega reckoning
scratch is better probably
now THAT would shake things up
SOMEONE FUCKED UP THE CHANNEL ORDER
WHO DONE IT
oh, no i'm a fucking moron
i muted channels that i had read up through and oc-hell disappeared from my list
i thought it got deleted or moved for a second
WHAT DO YOU WANT
no, it was the category mute where you click the category name
i hit it by accident, i don't usually bother with it
also that's pretty fucking sweet salami
just close everything already
the economy is already going to be fucked up trying to recover from the outrageous stimulus package that something like 92% went directly to corporations
why bother
not what i was talking about you bag of SHITE
_the boys are back_
wieners
makin and i are co-admins now, i asked him to come back because i'm not energetic or focused enough to handle community-wide events
real life stuff has been hitting me super hard and i'm worried about being able to dedicate enough time to this place, i certainly can't do it _alone_
i'm more of an interpersonal kind of guy anyway, i handle talking to individual people and sorting their issues out that way instead

we're both guy fieri
surprise
yeah uh
i think we're less than concerned about our standing with WP
it's been in the shitter since time immemorial, and we WANTED to improve it until we figured out that the official team was going to demand awful, unreasonable things from us and continue treating the fandom like dirt
we're our own thing and we're gonna keep it that way for the foreseeable future
we sparta now bois
i did
i'm too tired to do this shit by myself, and i'm not even that good of a fit for making things happen
i deescalate things, not make them more exciting
sad!!das
yep
after i released the emails a rep contacted me and said "hussie is really not happy about this. we said you could talk freely about stuff but that didn't mean releasing the emails point blank"
while failing to realize that i would probably have been talking shit about them without context, which would be even worse
i released them completely, it wasn't just made for here
you are a spy
hello spy
DMMD?
no, she got banned for posting horny shit all the time
had nothing to do with her shilling mastodon
although her whole "decentralized fandoms!" schtick got real fucking old too
lmao yeah
it was inherently inconsistent, which is fucking amazing
"the fandom should be decentralized! except i want the content creators to be in control of it!"
i couldn't believe what i was hearing
i mean, what would be spicy about this (so far)
"i asked makin to come back as an admin and he did"
makin owns the place again
look, i'm going to be completely honest
there have been a few times in the last couple of weeks where i have been like a hair's width away from resigning and making him admin again whether he wanted to be or not
i am so fucking stressed out and busy irl
this is basically the best way we can go forward, and i can't guarantee that i won't just take a break or resign anyway if things continue the way they have been
this place has been fine, it's purely irl things that have been fucking with me
anyway, i'm still here to handle stuff as i can
i don't have the attention span or energy to handle big shit
i just like making sure people are taken care of
i could be your angle, and he could be yuor devil
i'm already dead

lat is experiencing heroin withdrawal again
it just hit him like a sack of bricks
lat, i feel like we've become very strict and rigid about rules and joking with people in order to appeal to people who have very thin skin or unstable temperaments
maybe as we go forward we'll start moving in the opposite direction
it SURE IS BORING around here
i think i read the embed on discord and immediately thought "i'm never going to look at this"
i'm looking at it now and i think that decision was the correct one
"yeah, finding a job during the pandemic was really hard, so to keep myself afloat i decided to learn how to make black tar heroin" - tipsy, 2022
i got a master's degree in horticulture and i can't find a job either
i mean, i'm working kind of, but it's hardly an optimal set up
i never said we should be off-color, i said we should be able to take off the kid gloves with each other
don't start posting racist shit
fuck is the matter with you
"lat, i think we might be able to start being a little more abrasive with each other as we go forward"
"cool! YOUR MOTHER'S A FUCKING WHORE AND I HOPE SHE GETS RUN OVER BY A BUS"

at first i wanted to do worf's giant purple space bazooka but that's not an emote
so that's what you get
you know what i want to see
a mod of pokemon rby where they do some math and figure out the actual spatial distance between cities and
like, assume that the interior of each building is actually appropriately spaced
yeah, you can probably safely expand the city sizes if you also expand route sizes
but seriously, consider that the inside of red's house is pretty spacious, but then when you step outside it looks dinky as fuck
someone should figure out the ratio in play and use that to determine how big buildings and cities and routes would be if they were appropriately scaled

you can see that the house at the end of the safari zone is aobut 10-15 blocks in length and width
but on the larger map it only takes up about 8 blocks or so
so expand the rest house and scale the rest of the zone to match
add an option to run so people can still get around quickly, and it'd be cool prob
to be fair i don't think sonic spinball was supposed to be listenable with headphones
this might be slightly less earsplitting coming out of a CRT
although the actual instrumental timing is kind of off in places, i don't think that the sound engineer was sober when they made this track
```There is of course the instance system, but numerous Masto people have repeatedly reminded me of how federation works and so everyone from any instance can talk to anyone anyway so like it's basically the same social sphere as on Twitter.```
this is kind of what i suspected but i've never actually used mastodon, so i didn't want to pretend i knew it was the case
am i wrong in assuming that this person is talking about problematic people popping up and causing issues for other people
or is this a different problem they're talking about
```If your platform, by and large, is mostly just Twitter but with different branding and with different white techbros at the helm,

then why are you surprised that the social paradigm of Twitter ended up getting duplicated there?``` okay sure, i should have just kept reading
i have to say, i don't really know how to feel about this argument
it's worthwhile pointing out that mastodon is not actually immune to the problems that already afflict similarly designed websites
because i've witnessed a lot of masto users claiming it's totally different and free of strife in that regard, which is patently untrue
but i also feel like he's trying to rail against problems that don't necessarily have easy ways of being fixed
hrm
i guess my question is, where is that "system" coming from exactly
is it inherent to the platform itself or does it have to do with the users it attracts
i guess those are fundamentally tied to each other
is it??
what, are you saying the solution is just to get rid of social media
that's like saying we should destroy all humans because trying to feed everyone is too hard
i think a key component of an echo chamber is complete dismissal and refusal to acknowledge dissenting opinions from the consensus
dismissal meaning "you get rid of them"
we tend to circlejerk about our opinions sometimes but at the end of the day we actually have a pretty diverse set of emotional and philosophical viewpoints
i guess so

sorry, i just realized what was going on with the pins
<@!169992816519413760> that's fucking amazing by the way
polls are usually "wrong" in the sense that they're not 100% correct

"I've yet to meet someone who genuinely liked trump"
Dont you live in an urban center
Come out to rural Missouri, you'll find more than enough people who want to slobber his knocker
I was down in a relatively touristy part of the state and saw a shop that was literally covered in trump flags, like every square inch was draped over with one
It was fucking horrifying
Yeah
NJ ain't MO
And MO is relatively not as bad as the actual south
Thanks obama
draw a happy campfire song
that was the only one
what's there to be sad about
shove it up your ugly ass
yo what the fuck
this has sick style to it
it's just really nicely stylized
you make good art
"on a scale from 1-10, how much do you agree with the stances and behavior of members of the official team"
"of the 'official works' (list off the webcomic[s], epilogues, games), which do you enjoy"
something along those lines
ayy lmao
what the fuck is _this_
yeah, i've said a lot that we rely on user reports to actually take care of a wide swath of problems
you did NOT tag me in altgen recently
let me search for this shit
okay so you _did_ tag me, but i can't find the post you're describing
oh okay so that's what happened
because people used it purely to shit on official team members
like, not just criticize their work, but actually demonize them as people
<@!146014279529791488> the person who posted it deleted the shit, it's impossible to find that stuff
that's because they were deleted
once they're deleted, unless someone else happened to download the image, it's gone for good
discord purges that shit
urticating means "it stabs you"
the pins on that caterpillar do not stab you, at most it's like touching a very bristly comb
it'll make you feel a little itchy but not because of any chemical component, it's just because it's exciting your nerves
as with any other kind of physical touch
interdasting
fine joke in my opinion
fuck yes
when you bring it up unprompted and act all defensive it no really help you case.
<@!227181775221161984> careful, that's my sister you're talking down to
we don't take kindly to people who don't celebrate nepotism 'round these parts

<@!168980988477702145> no
impressive
that reminds me of an extremely embarrassing story
i don't know if i should tell it
fuck you, you existentialist menace
i don't know, the story is just "i didn't know this was a racial epithet"
i just said "negro" during a school discussion thinking it was a 100% acceptable way to refer to black people, because i had seen it in older books
people very quickly yelled at me
never made that mistake again
yeah but you live in texas, it doesn't count
yeah we all lost our shit wheals
it was great
yeah, it's completely real
that's the sad thing
ALIENS
what are those three subcultures exactly
webcomics, homestuck, discord community?
hm
many years in the future...
fuck you
i'll prank you all i want
i'll shove args up your ass
nah, that'd suck
we'd have _something_
also tera i want to visit the redwood forests of north cali again at some point, so going to oregon is on the table potentially
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
i said this in mod chat, but reading the survey results brought some much needed warmth to my cold dead heart
bringing back makin was unequivocally a good idea
i'm talking about makin's commentary
<#164122260913913857>
no gods, no kings
only jokers
i honestly prefer the second one i think
indeed
i don't think that the emotes are a big deal, we certainly have enough slots to work with
i'm not opposed to getting rid of them either
as long as we can fill the space with equally usable emotes
yeah that's fucking weird
i almost never ask for an emote, and i especially never COMMISSION one
god, i'm disgusting
indeed
smash cut to fuck sword art online why are you talking about it here
OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT
stop
god i hate you people
Money Plane.
```Someone just said "Van Halen is ass." *laughter*```

we need to get fucked up
what, did it get beleted or something
there's a visine for that
oh i didn't know that latter part
broke: farting a lot as the clown
woke: finding a way to make other people fart involuntarily
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> of course you did
yeah i'm only half in charge
the left side
yeah, that shit sucks
<@!226517338567081985> it's time for a reckoning
the gnomening was june of last year
that patreon merch be lookin sweet af tho
i would be participating more in this discussion but i have a tummyache, sorry lads
i nominate will smith
alternatively, woll smoth
yeah why even debate this big man, we all know the answer
come on, you can't tell me you want anyone but platinumgamerbob
it's downright lunacy
i could, but i'm not feeling well
i'll just shitpost instead
no
the evil is defeated!
you're allowed to share it once
anymore than that and you get knifed
"i have nothing to shill"
making original content is highly discouraged
all we're allowed to do in here is circlejerk about the past
he doesnt want people shilling their commission sheets in art channels
it happens more than you'd think
cool fanadventure
icerbearing
how about we run an experiment where we don't actually give oc-hell a pseudo hahahahaha
nat is a necessary evil to get rid of shit content
<@!257144766901256192> probably mollisol soils
`soft, deep, dark fertile soil formed in grasslands and some hardwood forests with very thick A horizons`
i was looking for that precise graphic, thanks krato
<@!120187484863856640> ci was literally our oc janitor
they did a pretty good job of balancing out nat too
too bad cookie, welcome to the rumble
we don't hate nat, she's my favorite gremlin
but she receives more complaints than literally every other staff member combined
she's gotten a lot better but she needs to be demoted to scrub monkey third class
if she stops drinking so much soda maybe we'll let her back
yeah nat
more precise information can be determined through chemical composition and location
the visual appearance is usually sufficient for classification though
like, soil can be pretty diverse but it's not hard to tell what makes it up if you're experienced
dark, rich, fertile soils are highly organic
ie lots of buildup of O horizon
it's nice
that list is pretty old at this point, and i'm not sure where it is anyway
i can tell you that the most active users will all be people from lit probably
you might want to get some opinions from gen
fugg :DDDDD
i agree with ifnar, he pisses me off with his dissent and it's hard to read his tone sometimes but he's a damn good dissenting opinion and we need that balance
magistrate as full mod would be hilarious but i doubt he'd want that
also yes, he's not terribly active
good job
it kind of is
we aren't doing young mods anymore
it's too much of a hassle
i thought you were a legal adult
reeee
bwee
keep talkin' shit
see what happens <:wacky:261895614961418240>


you have one last chance to repent cy
GONE
that is correct
oh shiiiiiit
december's not far this is great
thanks for the heads up
can't wait to experience the pure joy of childhood again
the mod list feels so weird to look at now
true
you wish, baby
we completely lost Dingus, Tensei, Cyrene, Valkyrie, Wadapan, Qweq, Erieolae, Shroom, Tyr
<:jaedsalut:327154090478010370>
oh shit you're right shroom is still here
<@!226517338567081985> it's going to be a nice little memorial for the old team
i'll commission something for the new team after a while
i like to have a little thing dedicated to staff members that depart on good terms and stuff, i had art done for a few people who got removed years ago
stuff like that
valk was really busy
she was looking forward to coming back after her schedule cleared up
but, well
it sucks, but this is why i asked makin to come back
given that this went down i'm extra glad i commissioned the thing to be honest
i am 26
<:feelsLinkyMan:684981387094261843>
yeah, we don't want anyone below the age of majority on the full staff
people get weird about that for some reason
i mean, i didn't necessarily want you on the team
at least not until you're an adult
well, fucking die i guess
but yeah this reckoning was pretty okay
i think i'll refer to it as The Huskening
pick up that ~~trashcan~~ bait
wow i fucked up the quote
nevermind, just leave me to die
no they're not
okay, look
pseudos and mods both have input on general server matters
they're part of "the council"
janitors just clean shit up
not incorrect
let me find it tensei
fine be that way
i'm gonna cook some chicken
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407107881767534602/764487761469112380/unknown.png
also this
tensei drafted a personal response to hussie that we were considering sending to him after things fell through
it was extremely scathing, surprised all of us
i know, i was lying tensei
you ruined it
this is why you were demodded
yep
i've got the good ol' autismo charismo
oh hey i found it, mind if i post it tensei


tensei talks like "ha ha i am dutch," it's like none of you have ever played overwatch with him
pathetic, truly
playing overwatch with tensei and nights is singlehandedly one of my favorite experiences on this server, watch your fuckin' TRAP civvie scum
i don't know, back then i think i was pretty okay but my skills really deteriorated over the years
they nerfed roadhog and i just lost all motivation to play
<a:pensiveWobble:530000479401279490>
have some other choice images from modchat

holy shit, is amuro like 4 feet tall
ass
advantage roll _this_
<:robotass:752311525699485717>
newest RLM is fucking great
great best of the worst
not for a while
i only have notes for today, not even a fully written entry
i guess i should write it out now while it's fresh in my mind
it's not just going to be the entry today though, i gotta update the current stats information cuz of the staff changes
and the channel reorganization, though that's not too bad
yes that too
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
nice
when will be program dune to run on a living cell
duh
controversial opinion maybe but i kind of wish that companies would stop going back to famous titles and revamping them
how many times are we going to get re-released games
nintendo in particular is very guilty of this
writing up this spat entry
might as well get it out
the first hopeful spat entry in 3000 years
what a day this has been
nah
makin needs to take a look and offer commentary or redact things
it'll probably be out tomorrow
get fuckd
well, i'll put in a good word for you
in retrospect i wish it had never happened at all
but perhaps it will come to be seen as a necessary shakeup
that's because it basically was nothing, i didn't do anything
i'm not fishing for compliments i'm saying i didn't make any major policy changes or whatever the fuck
yeah i did my job day to day but i'm not very imaginative
i think this current setup is good
i just wish it hadn't taken over half a year of stress and anxiety to get to this sort of understanding
get fucked lesbo
yeah, and i always believe it until i'm proven wrong
wait, are you serious
god, fuck this world
guess i'll delete it
FUCK OOOOOOOOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
when is "bro" going to be considered offensive
i think that might be the day i take my own life
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
here's a little lesson in ~~trickery~~ logical conclusions
no
misha is trying to indicate that blanket censoring certain terms because someone or another finds it offensive is an easily abusable principle
lat, the word "white" _isn't_ offensive, misha is using the socratic method here
okay, maybe there IS something unironic transpiring here
i thought this was more complex than that
i thought misha was trying to use an unaccepted example to indicate why common practice could be pointed at as illogical or arbitrary
why do we allow certain words over others
i think it's safe to say it boils down to common consensus
he's got you there
so did he up his game or what
she eats a weird bug and doesn't even care
wow, didn't realize discord servers existed so long ago
ENHANCE
i think i side more with misha here
i like both plenty but the og has some extreme issues with pacing
i don't necessarily feel that there are disconnects, at least not on a narrative level
but it's definitely not a fluid experience
it's more like molasses
i don't necessarily mind the latter part, they learned they have no hope to extend their lifespan so they're left to die on their own time
the part about having weird jobs at the start of it was way more cogent a point
like why the fuck would they do that if they need to be hiding
wh
i don't think most of the people in the movie are _insane_
unless you're calling their adjustment to an insane world insane, in which case alright
kind of awkward to watch the og knowing that harrison ford and whats her nuts hated each other's guts
the romance scenes are all extremely bizarre
slow is boring for lots of people
i don't know how else to explain that spending a large amount of time on a single scene can get boring for people
the "action" in 2049 is very passionless
which is good
i think it's extremely good
it was totally tense though
the whole point of that fight is not ||which replicant wins||
it's ||what is going to happen to deckard||
and the entire time the water is coming up
that's where the tension comes from
yeah well you're a wiener and you're objectively wrong, so suck on dese nuts
nah i get where you're coming from though
well, it's like being taken for a ride
there's so much going on and you're basically being torn along in this world
the rain is cascading down and the water's coming up
the light is being drowned out
the music sweeps you up in those great synthesizer rips
it's honestly very sensationally engaging
can't believe i allowed myself to get drawn into bladerunner talk
i needed to be asleep an hour ago
fuck you for being interesting
fuck you my grigio
i want to talk about NEO NOIR
ii'd enjoy that
not enough neon, not good enough technology, not enough transhumanism
we'll get there eventually
yeah
there's no way to let users change vanity roles themselves without weird perm fuckery
i've been alive for hours
give me your teeth
i almost did when i woke up
you guys didn't get to see mod chat
actually here there's one image that summarizes it

yeah but i made my peace with it and him
he filled out the unban form
i've made it clear that he has to abide by our expectations, so
no reason for me to be a dick and say "NO" like a petty baby
the conditions are "just don't break the rules or be a fucking asshole"
same as for anyone else
we're a comedy duo, don't you see
makin is the stooge and i'm the straight man
<@!111477124384202752> if we banned people for breaking the letter of the law every time, your ass would have been gone years ago
yeah, exactly
so shut the fuck up you bab
oh my god SHUT THE FUCK UP
i don't want to talk about this
maybe there's a reason we're the biggest homestuck community left
people are trying however they can i guess
we'll see how things might shape up within a couple of weeks
very stress inducing waiting for the elections though
i'm just annoyed
i want it to be over already
election's on november 3rd
just over two weeks
or 4th, yeah
so i _was_ right
ha ha
anyway, yeah, it's coming up
i won't be able to rest easy until i know jeb! is safely in the white house
yep
kansas city has this thing going on called "We've Got This KC!" where it's supposed to be a virtual job fair
apparently people are hiring
but no one i know is getting hired
covid's not going away for at least another year
oh yeah no
people are definitely out and about in america
i don't know what it's like in the cities but out here no one even enforces the signs that say you need a mask
are you saying you care about homestuck now, somehow
wow
ah, okay
you're forgiven
same
i want to play spelunky real bad after watching vinny play it
but uh
i believe someone brought up noita
going back to that
do the unlocks in that game actually mean very much
as in, are any of the spell orbs that consequential or powerful
yeah but nuke is nigh unusable
you want to instantly kill yourself? just pick it up
just pick it up and see what happens
anyway point taken
i don't know, i feel like noita is pretty intensely roguelite
the spell orbs are very...
not involved
i feel
in the general progression of things
yeah, appreciated
<:UNRELENTINGTRASH:456927328929316865>
it means we appreciate you
get fucked bitch
follow the instructions
there should be a set of instructions
did you buy it from a fucking hobo
check in the box
... wow
<:UNRELENTINGTRASH:456927328929316865>
apparently rem lezar appeared in a snickers commercial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhEQ066WDAA&feature=emb_title
it's one of the movies we're watching for halloween
no, we're not
NO
WE'RE NOT
thoguh i wish we would
it was a joke
<@!154008479802195968> we're all getting older and we have more responsibilities, and our love for the thing that brought us all here is fading slowly but surely
unrelated note but me irl https://youtu.be/OyP1UIHUAz4?t=69
TOAST
god, venture bros was so fun
pinging toast every single time afterwards
good times

a fucking leaf
i am currently proceeding to your destination
i remember when i had only been here for a week
little did i know what i was getting myself into
no not really
it was pretty jarring
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
never happened to me
why this
i swear to god that's gotten quoted by linkybot before
no, i guess not
i main captain falcon 1v1 me noob
in real life i'm not only built like a brick shithouse, i'm also a blackbelt
that second thing doesn't mean much other than i know how to punch a fucker
but the point stands
just wait until tomorrow
if you want to be a decent human being you have to be willing to make sacrifices
nat's just tsundere, it's all fine
you can't hide what's inside
<@!604496853295300676> <@!349796790360473601> knock it off
or at least go to altgen or something
i don't need to see this crap here
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
it's not, that's silly
they just have similar settings
mad max becomes an apocalypse because of a petrol shortage
"The Petrol Wars" or whatever
it's not clear if the desertification happens because of nuclear war or not
but the entire reason that they're always fighting over gasoline is because there's not al ot of it anymore
it's kind of stupid when you really sit down and dissect it
but you're not really supposed to, it's not the point
i don't remember if it's ever specified in fist of the north star why nuclear apocalypse happens
but that show is simialr in that it's not really the point, the point is to watch this dude bust out sick martial arts and kill people en masse
i've never seen the original trilogy so i don't know what they're like really
i've floated the idea of doing a mad max group stream at times
yeah
mad max 1 is thematically about max struggling to maintain the vestige of the old world despite suffering horribly in a variety of ways
and to my understanding mad max 2 and 3 (and fury road) are about max trying to survive and forgetting about the old world, but then circumstances arise where he revives some of that inborne humanity to accomplish something good
i mean, in the first movie he was a cop, a defender of law and order
and now the entire world lacks any sort of law or order, so he's effectively lost
no fuck you
if we're going to do a group stream at some point we're doing thunderdome
i've been promised stupidity and i'll get my pound of idiocy
then we will suffer together
but pikachu doesn't want to evolve into raichu
wait
the pikachu or the thunderstone
i just don't know what to say, i never expected to hear these words
damn
how is it only 11 AM, jesus christ
yeah i hate it
let me go back
alright, i'm giving up on my plan to keep my hair until after winter
it's already too unkempt and i hate working with it
time to go get a haircut
that reminds me, i have yet to make a fully operable in-atmosphere and space plane in kerbal space program
you don't need to fully reinvent orbital mechanics, at least not in a codified manner
i went almost entirely unassisted and it's more a process of any other video game, where you try out various strats and see what sticks
if you want to put the results that work into words, _then_ i guess you'd be reinventing orbital mechanics
it's had a tutorial for a while i believe
as in, specific scenarios you load up with instructions
man, that'd be wild lat
more efficient probably
like, somehow developing methods that would be more cost-effective than what we currently use in real life
absence of punishment for an offense doesn't mean that punishment of an offense doesn't exist, it's not possible for officials to keep an eye on things 100% of the time
we run into this problem all the time
"YOU SAY YOU DON'T ALLOW THIS, SO WHY DID I SEE IT"
maybe cuz there's only two dozen of us at most in a server with thousands of active users, and we all have lives
i imagine it's even harder with something that isn't just conversationally based
primordial
oh yeah definitely
i'd put in a good word for most of our previous staff
_most_
i'm looking an can't find any discounted headphones
no microphone either, totally unusable
what is this song
i'm weirdly interested
sorry, i'm going out to get a haircut
gonna contract covid, it's gonna be sweet
cougg
pronounced "coog"
be the change you want to see in the world qweq
also it just might misha
i have to drive about 25 miles into town to get to a barber, then while i'm in town i'll be grabbing a few supplies/groceries
i already have a job
i wish i didn't
no
they only taught me to stand tall and unwavering when my comrades fell
i'm sure there's a barber in the town that's closer, but i don't trust the quality of anything in my hometown
going up to the college town
ehhhh FUCK IT
LET'S TALK ABOUT``
BRING BACK THE FUCKING FLOOR CLEUNS
<@!152473728465371137> bring back #ss13 already
oof
well, disregard then i guess
aren't we considering opening our doors to the public
inb4 "WHY ARE YOU CLOSED"
we need a more experienced playerbase because all of the veterans get bored and leave
and it makes everyone else go away
how does any SS13 server advertise to new people
did we put up a link on the subreddit for previous times
well, i don't see any other way to keep the same thing from happening
it starts off strong, then fades as the mroe experienced players get bored and leave
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
anyway, i guess that's what i'm laying out
we don't need to put it up on the sub but the same thing will happen as before
if we want a persistent playerbase it needs to be talked about in more places than just this server
and even then i'm sure it'll still fall off over time, the minecraft server lasted for a solid length of time when it was first put up on the sub but it too eventually fell away
most, in fact
fuck you bitch we're going to space
anyway this problem isn't for me to figure out right now, i need to go get my keratin filaments lopped off
be back later
also yes putnam don't feel obligated to work on our shit
<@227181775221161984> haha wagie
He says while seething from having no proper job in the first place
Short version is that I moved in with my grandparents cuz grandpa still works and my grandma can't take care of herself, they pay me for it but I purposefully charge them only what they can afford and it's very demoralizing work
I did actually look for a proper job first, this wasnt really the ideal outcome
Hardly a surprise that no one is really hiring right now though
Let me just learn Dutch and move to the Netherlands, and also develop all of the skill requirements for an IT job
I should probably do that last one regardless
What even is an IT guy expected to have
A degree in CS?
Also biology is oversaturated or something
That's fucking bizarre
no pay ME 10,000 dollars
i'll give you my everlasting gratitude
that's fair, i'll save up my wage for a couple months so i can get a burger at mcdonalds
oh right, a couple years
it's my special meal
i get it once a year
a value fries
it tastes as salty as my tears
that's the joke
god motorcity is so fun
yeah
can't wait for more
good for aysha, moving up and away from this fetid machine
no one knows, it was never announced
as is typical of this property

<a:HYPERHUSKY:394821981381328896>
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
i can't fucking believe what i'm reading
that would be hilarious if it were some kind of copypasta
oh
that's not fun at all
this sucks
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
what about the ones who achieve enlightenment and don't have to do that anymore
<@!213413608732884994> <:pog:576614562598748213>
yeah, gehenna is basically just a pervasive element that makes people uncomfortable, and that they're trying to avoid triggering, but no one knows anything concrete about it
it's a good balance
not to intrude on this conversation, as much as i like vampire the masquerade, but i'm playing some old gmod ragdoll slaughter maps
i'm kind of amazed at how much this stuff entertained me when i was younger
i used to be able to fling ragdolls down these chutes for hours and laugh almost the entire time
what happened
has the internet changed, or have i
<:GONE:696509069233487972>
<:monke:589526124556451842>
gottem?
i say no, yeesh
let that be enough ttrpg discussion for today
i clap my hands and the banners of the great hall change color
it's time to eat, students
well done slytherin well done slythering
HOWEVER
this is probably the single stupidest segue i've ever attempted, but everything about it is making me laugh my tits off
i just wish hades would get done updating so i can leave you all alone
i believe it's important to _be able_ to divorce source material from author, the qualities of each can be analyzed together _or_ separately
and often for the purpose of divulging a work's innate qualities, it's better to analyze it as a standalone thing
character deaths, general thematic darkening
never, if you keep asking for it
you reap what you sow
hades is fun but i find that i can't play it too long
i'm kind of impressed at the fact that, despite how much stuff there is, i don't feel overwhelmed by any of it
back to that, huh
it _has_ been a while
but nah
there are other, better things to do
like...
.................
yeah i guess so
oh fuck i wanted to try doing deus ex again
maybe i can try that instead
the logo is even "SUS" i can't believe this
brazil is like a pit of cultural quicksand
you think you're gonna be fine, but before you know it you're in up to your fucking neck
yo that video has censored porn in it
get rid of it
i like a good YTP as good as anyone else but we've banned other people for it
or threatened to anyway
looking at you qweq, with whatever that shit was the other day
yeah that's unabridged goku ass too
incredible
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i mean, i don't personally care, it's just funny in retrospect
pretty fucking _crazy shit_ in there though
i mean, apparently it's like
with youtube TOS you can't take actual porn and censor it and call it good
but you can censor _drawn_ porn and call it good
who knows why this is the case
maybe something to do with loose definitions of art or whatever
as it is, it doesn't matter because youtube is moderated primarily by robots
so basically, we are all doomed
fire ze missiles
it's okay neth, i'm not jumping up your ass about it
i was just letting you know, and also like i told qweq check your stuff more closely
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i guess it's kind of like the uh
at your fingertits video
which also has it, but extremely briefly and _entirely_ censored
it's weird to adjudicate
https://imgur.com/zUnhLdR
was it in fact a fart video
if not, let me guess
okay i don't know what this is all of a sudden
i somehow forgot about this one
even though i got it just recently
though there's a reason for that
woc's DMs are like natural disasters
you can't stop them, and by the time they're done you feel like you have to rebuild everything from scratch
i wish he said that
also one time late at night i actually did witness a truck driving along with sparks flying out from beneath the car
it wasn't a police chase but it was still fucking bizarre
didn't have any music videos though
it gets dinged for that
<@!207991389613457408> i just got done with the tutorial for deus ex, experiencing a couple of problems
i didn't know there was a patch, let me at 'em
steam version, GOTY
i don't remember why i stopped the first time
it seems fun
hopefully i get farther and beat it
honestly, that's a very recent problem
i use--
misha, why
why do you hurt me like this
i trusted you
as it is, i used to complete the things i started without exception
in fact, fixating on them until they were complete
i'm not sure what happened to me
it's probably the depresso expresso
not always
it's probably a combination of things
i'm not going to dwell on it too hard today
it feels like i've been going "guys i'm sad look at me reee" a lot and i don't want to do that
so instead let's focus on something _else_ that's horrible
apparently ryan haywood of rooster teeth has been habitually preying on his staff and fans for years
always a punch in the fucking gut to hear about stuff like that
how long ago did this stuff come out
<:punctuation:305073440975486976>
guess i'm glad i didn't bother trying to start transcribing those minecraft LPs too
adam kovick or whatever his name is
<@!207991389613457408> works great now, thanks brazil boy
whoops
may have spoke too soon
visuals are halting once i reach the main screen
sound is still going and i can hear myself mousing over options, but no picture
üò©
changing it from borderless fullscreen to just regular fullscreen fixed it
i'm fine with that
maybe, we'll see
<:thonklace:677200756440301569>
caffeine free coke is great
i should go back to drinking that instead of the regular shit
i mean
i don't drink it because i think it tastes better or something, i like caffeine just fine
it's just that my dad and dero both can't drink caffeine or else it fucks with them
so we had a lot of caffeine free coke around the house and it tastes basically identical
kind of healthy honestly
if i want my caffeine i get it through something more dedicated to the purpose, like energy drinks
he has not
gimme the skinny
i mean, i would argue that the sugar is worse than the caffeine
i didn't used to take to that sentiment but after looking a bit, putnam was right
not only is excessive sugar is bad for you, it's also fucking _everywhere_
like, especially in soda
woc is fine being called sandy in here too, i think
can't remember him saying anything specific about it though
i just know he's a flagrant wiener
shame!
no bwee
with every patreon channel that's opened, my work recording the stats for the server increases by a little more
if you enjoy my suffering, use that as motivation to spend more money
no sein, although there could be
in fact, i don't see why not
it just feels weird releasing only one entry
i could technically write a second one right now but it feels really weird writing something that just says "user5 is back"
so i don't think i will
i'll write about user5 coming back in a later entry
in my butt? spi--okay good
i knew i shouldn't have gotten the suppository
is misha drunk again
is he abusing us right now
my god
that _definitely_ sounds like something an abusive guy would say
i'm calling the police
i'm sick of the adventures
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
alright, i'll get to work on releasing the spat entry
shouldn't take long, expect it in about half an hour
it would be less time but i want to update the staff sheets
so y'all can wait
"hey baby i can't wait to take you back to my apartment and beat the ever loving SHIT out of you" - weird people, unironically i'm sure
clean it up, undergrad
i was going to put something in the notes for spat but makin didn't technically make a comment so i don't know what to do with it
i guess i'll just say it here
at some point i use the word "winge"
makin made a note saying it's spelled "whinge"
funnily enough, neither variant is accepted in american english
it turns out "whinge" is british spelling and "winge" is australian
alright, finally
https://drewlinky.com/Drew/SPAT/bookii2020.html#11O
enjoy
please remind me what that was about
wait, what
you want me to remove your name because it would be funny???
okay, then just say that second one
i don't give a shit if it's funny or not, but requesting to be removed for anonymity is fine
give me a list of places where you appear and i'll change your name
or is it just the one spot
gotta move yo body preebleh
get fucked blue man
welp, another survey down the fucking drain
wish we had gotten the unabridged results at least
no, i don't feel like talking to sky
i just figure she wouldn't feel like it since we beaned her and all
i should probably say something but it's kind of weird, no
"i'm not going to bring up the fact that we banned you for posting horny shit in the chat. can i get those stats"
you have to wait six months for a ban appeal
anyway what do you mean tera
like... less than a month, i think
like what
what
all of the appendices are here
there are four appendices, A through D
dude
i do not have the mental tolerance to catalogue every single thing we've got now
it was an insane undertaking in the first place
if you want to organize it and convert it to html so i can add it, please do so
otherwise i cannot be assed
<@!748465376593182750> go to <#187028510848712704>
what the FUCK
WERE YOU NOT EVER ACTUALLY A JANITOR VELI
<a:HyperNotLikeThis:520455961069223940>
i'm fucking losing my mind apparently
were you lat? didn't know that
when was this
oh, fuck off then
i kill you
wasn't me, unironically
or ironically, depending on your perspective
anyway
i've got the related materials table fixed
let me go see about umbra's name i guess
<@!542086093776879616> fixed, you shit

there are at least four or five other occasions in this server where that sort of thing has happened aner
"i want to do this thing"
"that's retarded"
"i guess i am now doing the opposite of thing"
it's usually been the right move, this is why we have dissenting opinions
wow, yeah
of all the words of pen and tongue, none are as sad as these: "carlarc was right again"
<@!205026834205769748> stop being a fucking prophet, or else
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
and it's going ot stay that way
because it was a stupid cult of personality
<@!207991389613457408> holy shit i just tasered a dude and it felt fun
"THEY FOUND US" bzzzzzt
wait a second, the tazer isn't working again
like, i can't do another one
what is this
also smash burgers are GREAT
FUCK YOU WHOEVER SAID THEY'RE BAD
a tazer has fucking _ammo?_
why is this a fucking thing
i hate it
guess it's down to barehanded takedowns
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:741919221214347276>
how am i supposed to stealth takedown these guards
are you serious
what happened to nonviolent options
okay now i'm kind of pissed, that's stupid
whatever
well when do you get a baton
i don't have one yet
we got hit with a variety of things
belt was most common, but if we pissed our parents off real bad mom would get kitchen utensils
all of them
as long as they're actually bantz and not just slinging your poo all over the wall
<@!207991389613457408> haha, holy shit
i think i'm hooked
i just got done with the first mission, about to get on the boat for the power plant
i have a few things i'm curious about though
gimme a few to get in bed
well, it looks like misha is dead, so i'll ask him stuff tomorrow
you're next
METY is too, if he don't stop SAYING SHIT AND THEN NOT SENDING IT
lmao
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
my bad
also mines, i guess the main thing i'm curious about is how impactful are random, small decisions on the outcome of the story
because i've been given the impression that there are highly variable outcomes to the story depending on your actions
for example: i was checking all the rooms for loot in the UNATCO HQ and i walked into the women's restroom
didn't think anything of it, until old man said "stay out of there, it's embarrassing"
ah, so lots of little things while most of it is the same
are there multiple endings
is there a "true ending"
i'll just try to get that one
ugh
okay
~~i spent literally an hour longer on the first mission because i wanted to be stealthy~~
maybe i won't worry about that quite as much from now on
thank god for save scumming
lmao, really
<:smushHusky:599354144859619349>
anyway, i guess the point is that i've felt the magic
i'm definitely going to be finishing this up
what's up spook
thanks
i can't wait to flip off THE WORLD
here, let me try
borp
shit, the 'tism strikes again
you wish, you little grubby demon
i smell a gun incoming
you can, very easily
aren't you fucking tiny
get out of here stomachlet
i need to learn how to cook stuff in a wok
what's the problem with non-stick
doesn't a wok require a specific kind of stovetop or someting
interdasting
i used to have a gas stove as a kid but have used electric only for the better part of 15 years
i was going to say
i think you just lived in a really, _really_ shitty apartment interro
yeah misha, your gotcha of "this was funded by x" doesn't really persuade me all that much
i was conducting research on soybeans funded by soybean farms and companies, does that mean that all of the shit i did was automatically invalid
the methodology is the only thing that actually _matters,_ and being able to understand what exactly is happening and why
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
the absolute state
yeah, i think that's the primary argument here
can gas stoves be operated safely? yes, i'm sure in a majority of situations they are
but do they have associated risks, yeah
actually, misha suffering from extensive carbon monoxide poisoning would explain a few things
misha, do you remember that time you said you thought someone was in your house and leaving higurashi videos up on your computer
you wouldn't, because you WERE EXPERIENCING CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING
~~lat i was fucking joking~~
yeah, if they had a good CO/CO2 level before i don't think they do anymore
burn more rainforest bolsonaro
look, all memeing aside, i think the overall point is that most gas stove incidents would be caused by user error more than anything else
even if the housing code is bad, it's usually because someone leaves the shit on
when it's not being used
<@!266297207114825728> no
do not do it again
steam should not be setting off the fire alarm, i don't think that's how that works
hm
i guess steam _can_ set off a fire alarm
there's a sensor that can detect when it's covered in fine particles
apparently water vapor counts
i have to admit though, i always took the batteries out of my fire alarm
at least in my last apartment
i lived in the basement, where the walls were all cement
i didn't fear fire that much
yeah, it was like being given a contracted view of the rest of my life
no, i'm pretty sure he was making a joke about being an unhire-able biologist and dirt sifter
there are a few different methods for chemical synthesis of glycine, i don't know that i would consider this particularly impressive news https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine#Production
so far the phosphine was way more interesting

underused channel tbh
fuck you, walnut life forever mofucka
oh yeah, speaking of writing fanfiction, in case any of you missed it a new spat entry went out last night
go git
surely you're not this lazy
just go to the website
i have one website motherfucker
why did you link to the note...
use the changelog
nope, it has an s in american english
i know what i'm about you fucking stooge
need to replenish my nitrogen levels
wath
i wrote that before it was decided
i'll say a thing next time
you exhaust me
go away
maybe someday
i used to read a lot
üß†
i don't draw things
i'm saying i'm not interested
other people should definitely participate though
i don't know about asia/africa as a whole but i do know that in india, schizophrenic manifestations are typically described as being very kind and nice to people who experience them
<@!207991389613457408> strong monke create many bananas --> many bananas create weak monke --> weak monke create few bananas --> few bananas create strong monke
this conversation took a fucking bizarre turn
D-> linky bring us back
fuck
what the actual fuck is happening
yes
YES
which anime girl
also how did your advisor react
"the ritual must begin"
mint, whenever i hear things like this, i just remember that saying about how life is just a lot of slowly dying
always
reading shit like this just makes me feel like mr. krabs in that one episode where you see him at home sleeping
and then it does a closeup on him and he's crusty as fuck
this is me whenever people start talking about homestuck 2 fans in real life
i hate trying to go to sleep but i hate trying to wake up just as much
it's not unusual to be loved by anyone
are you sure you don't live around skyplayer or one of the official team members
yeah vac, lmao
read A DIFFERENT STORY
bweeeeeeeeeeeeeee
oh, you don't mean someone in your area
you just mean Someone Out There is doing hs2 graffiti
wig
you know what i suddenly want to see again
that one experiment we had where if enough people react with a pushpin, the post got pinned automatically in a certain channel
money would be good too
anyway i know altgen ruined that experiment but it was fun
that terezi looks like she wants to go down on someone for crack, and shred their genitals with her teeth
i'm sorry, i made myself laugh so hard that i thought i was going to have an aneurysm for a minute
it's allowed, it's just moronic and disrespectful as fuck
not bannable, but certainly mockable
why are you asking me, makin's the dog person
i'm not much of a pet person in general
i don't mind them, and dogs in particular are very nice, but if i had a choice i would just have no pets
but once you have 5+ dogs it becomes very hard to want one
i've had enough of pets for al ifetime
it wasn't me, it was my mother
for context, i've lived out in the country for a while
we used to own five dogs, four cats, a dozen chickens, and two horses
i don't want anymore pets
government buildings too
gentrification is scary if you're poor or a minority
i mean, i don't fear it in the way i fear being eaten alive by a monster
but it's pretty existentially dreadful
housing crisis is real
yeah but the cost of living isn't the same everywhere
people usually get driven to lower income areas
i got rid of wiener meister
gentrified neighborhoods usually have pricier stores over cheaper ones
poor people shop at walmart
i don't even know what shopping chains there are for classier neighborhoods
i mean, it sounds like your area is differently gentrified
i mean, it _is_ the netherlands
and not america
i'm not surprised we aren't on the same page
true, i don't really know what i'm talking about here
BOBA
TEA
like korean clockwork
i discovered that i'm one of those people who can enjoy taro
my gf fucking hates it
she got the soap end of the stick
wow, i feel fucking attacked
the two pictures krato shared are _exactly_ what the walmart and local grocery store are like
except i guess the grocery store is smaller
it's about 50-75% that size
it's not suburban though, to be fair
yeah, i know
i've just never seen such a naked example of it
it's one thing to visit a walmart here or there in the area, but seeing it from an aerial view is like
"this is all of them"
"they are all like this"
the point i'm trying to make is that the design is pretty unyielding, to the point that i've never thought about how intentional it is
~~some walmarts do sell popped popcorn at the food court~~
kmart used to do it too

all of america is one giant version of the witch from hansel and gretel

time to ruin my search history, again
https://www.vice.com/en/article/aeaqe5/this-pop-up-had-me-eating-like-an-animal-from-a-trough
the age of the shopping mall is over
there's two big shopping complexes i'm aware of in and around kansas city, one is called the crown center and the other is called the independence center
the crown center is, i'm sure, still pretty popular and active (covid notwithstanding)
it's smack dab in the middle of the city
the independence center is an oddity, it's out in the suburbs but it's fucking enormous
it has three stories and the interior is one giant hollowed out space so you can see basically everything
also on the ground floor in the middle is a giant play area for children, complete with an old-style merry-go-roud
FUCK
WHAT
THE CAROUSEL WAS REMOVED LAST YEAR
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

i used to enjoy riding this thing when i was a kid, this SUCKS
either way it's fucking hilarious
i used to go all the time as a kid
it's okay
a good place to pick up diseases
fucking excuse me, what
the name
i've never heard of this
it sounds great though
pizza
never heard of it
there was a place around where i lived that had a bunch of shit in it, including something called "The Ball Zone"
even as a young child i was like "hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
probably a huge liability
imagine getting crushed while playing lasertag
i'm not sure i've been to a dave and buster's yet
it sounds like it'd be fun
i'm still chuckling at "chunky cheese"
you wouldn't get it lat
i've oft said that they need to make like an adult version of those play tubes
either expand their size or make like a fun jungle gym or something
something that's neat to explore
i would pay to explore like an airplane hangar sized building that's just filled with a variety of obstacle courses
fuck you
i can't describe how much i hate you right now
i used to go rock climbing, in seriousness
there was a rockwall available at my university
again, i don't think it'd be the same thing
i'm not just talking about endless generic tubes
i'm envisioning something more interesting
how about in an environment where i'm not at risk of getting fucking killed
oh man, you're right
i bet teenagers would smoke crack like nobody's business in those places
oh, no, they don't smoke crack here
they smoke meth 'round these parts
meth country
i mean, weed too probably
i'm just saying, there's a lot of meth here
also >whippits
sorry what decade is this again
whippits are nitrous oxide
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide#Recreational_use
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> jesus christ
nitrous oxide is very strange stuff
it actually does have some kind of chemical effect on the brain besides restricting oxygen saturation
it's not metabolized hardly at all though
anyway, i was only aware that it was a huge thing in the UK, didn't realize the netherlands also had something to do with it
guess it's just one of those things
<@!338881173268987904> >a fucking leaf
look out, we got a badass over here
it's your subconscious telling you something something
good doggo

the eternal
just more of the same
we haven't had a good raid in a long time
like, years
which is good, but also boring
there will probably never be something like the Fuck Raid ever again
the Fuck Raid is an event that happened some years ago where over 400 discord bots joined this server and all said "Fuck" exactly one time each
it took us hours to ban them all
yeah, it was fucking annoying at the time but in retrospect it was a really classy, interesting raid
as opposed to when there were a couple weeks where someone raided this server with bots and alt accounts that spammed child porn, that was a very upsetting time
we had a few volunteers that pulled all-nighters keeping an eye out for the accounts and recording the info to report it to discord staff
it was me, ngame, and someone else i think
those were really bad times
yeah
that was easily like three or more years ago at this point
thankfully nothing like it has happened since, just the typical raiding party that spam _regular_ porn or gore or something
but even those have kind of stopped being a thing
i remember we once got a single man raid last year at some point where they spammed daily dose
that was still gross and needed to be removed immediately, but it was hilarious
they're far and few between now
and the few spammers we do get are very boring, just "ping spam"
indeed
we keep the security settings high so people actually have to put in effort
that's usually enoguh to discourage most of them
the fucking gym raid was great
i didn't even get to see it but just stories of it are great
<:gachiGASM:353818316046991361>
you will live on in our hearts billy herrington
you were a precious human being
honestly mint, we need one
someone should rent a channel for it
i would get back into weightlifting for that
oh SHIT
YOU'RE RIGHT
this channel has inspired me, i'm going to get my weights out of my trunk and start doing basic lifts again
i'm doing a lot of work around the hosue anyway, it'll be good to try and get back some of my gainz
a gym filled with nothing but work harder
i'm not white, i'm melanistically challenged
yeah i was just going to say "lite-albino" but it didn't sound as funny
looking at it again though, neither was what i said
"like a blend of neanderthal and cro-magnon, with some ancient chimpanzee on top"
you try eating root vegetables, nuts, and dirt for 200,000 years and see how you like it
who could have seen this coming
to twitter fiends, apparently yes
he starts walking at you, scattily
<@!184545248930693120> no i have not
this is probably one of the worst things i have ever seen
not in execution, but conceptually
i would sell my right arm
i am
god dammit
<@!207991389613457408> i really wish i could stream myself playing this
it's so fucking dumb and fun
i'm pulling off rarted strats thanks to save scumming
i'm at battery park
just cleared the subway tunnel
not gonna lie i could also use an audience, i keep forgetting where to go or what to do because the goals page isn't all that helpful sometimes
haven't talked to her yet
okay, i talked to her once already
but there was no option to actually talk to her, as in offer a dialogue choice
yeah
i did
both, i snuck in a back way and killed everyone
lmao
okay
god dammit, i wonder if i can stream even with shit upload speeds if i finagle some settings
probably not
this sucks man
<:PepeHands:547970973497032706>
what a disaster
oh well, i will provide updates where i can
literally the only hardline provider is charter
we could also get hughesnet but it wouldn't be much better while being many times more expensive
i hate the internet out here, it is really fucking bad
what a world we live in
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
<@!207991389613457408> This city is LIT man! Yeah.
why did that get me, of all things
there is no rational explanation
<:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
<@!207991389613457408> so i understand the confusion
i went and cleared the subway first
THEN i went and got the ambrosia
didn't realize it was the other way around
the balancing in this game is hilariously bad
deus ex
i have a 10mm pistol that takes fucking forever to aim and doesn't have a lot of range
meanwhile i have a sawed-off shotgun with much tighter aim AND i used it to snipe two guard dogs from a roof top
i love it
well, when half of them are broken, you have no choice
holy shit, if only
oh, wait
no, i didn't even see that part
i was looking at the senatorial race
this fucking sucks
thought it would be early vote reporting
i feel kind of bad for him, he's riding the waves of his intense mania
but i also feel less bad about them because he indulges in it through ego-feeding
figured they were talking more generally
what about terraria
speak up, young one
waiting for this god damn steel to smelt
also qweq play deus ex
join us
unoless you have already
in which case
bwee?
you should grab it
it's old so i'm sure it's cheapo
<@!213413608732884994> if i grab it for you, will you at least give it a try
no harm done if you don't enjoy it
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
alright, well
if you change your mind, let me know
i'm sorry you were having a rough time qweq
is it over now at least?
oh
has league been the only thing stressing you out??
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> i was asking if whatever's stressing you out is done with
i'm just trying to sympathize you FUCK
but nah i get you
i've also been weirdly irritated the last couple days
i don't really know why
it's just been this awful malaise
mhm
except it does drain you, then before you know it you're just exhausted and done with everything
shit sucks
you know what helps?
i was going to say alcohol, but friendship
let's all be gay and friendly together, chat
ifnar is a generous god
<a:blinkWot:760147457530396695>
We're actually at 17,700
We briefly passed 17,800, then makin came back
I can't see the total number of users on mobile, or just dont know how
This tbh
I don't understand, what's the significance of this
Whatever they are
When have there not been American vtubers
Am I missing something
Make it happen, government
When in doubt,  assume its weebery

Sadomasochistic salami
The channel or the movies
Damn
Right, so
I'm at a hospital while my grandmother gets some stuff taken care of
Nothing serious, just chilling in the lobby
They have Ellen on the tv
I dont know if its covid or if Ellen has just gotten progressively weirder, but her show feels like watching aliens
Her whatever musician came out dancing in a blue boa and was weaving in and out of what I assume were propped up TVs, which all showed a random person dancing
I assume because they can't have a live audience
There do seem to be a lot of older, portly males hanging around in the lobby
Hmm....
<@604496853295300676> she had reconstructive knee surgery, at some point her kneecap had shattered after a fall and she's been in a cast for the last month
Gotta take the cast off, remove stitches, and put the cast back on for two more months
Mechanical was a pretty cool channel
I might use it more often now too, I have various ideas for home improvement and little DIY projects
She didn't fall down any stairs, she just morbidly obese
That's why my grandparents hired me to take care of her, I'm the only one in the family ~~still willing to put up with her~~ strong enough to lift her up
Could god make a mecha so big that not even he could pilot it properly

How dare
I need to continue my streak of consuming new media
Deus ex is great
Can't even remember why I stopped playing it before
Oh my god, theres a Paris too
Poggers??
Okay so I'm about halfway through then, i just got to Hong kong
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
At least  I have more opportunities to level up, I put points into melee weapons cuz I'm trying not to kill everyone
I prefer knocking them unconscious
MAX LETHALITY
I guess I shouldn't really care this much about it
But theres that one retired general who was like
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON THE MISSION AND NOT ON BODY COUNT
and I was like "oh man, he's right"
I mean, five conversations but definitely plenty of lines
On my way out of MJ12 he literally said "I think big institutions with a solid foundation can outlast any individual upstarts who try to take it over"
But not as part of a conversation, just as a throwaway line
That was pretty weird and cool writing
I guess the question is, at what point does it become incontrovertible that an organization should be reset completely
Even a structuralist must recognize that some things are unsalvageable
After all, you don't just reform something like the mafia
Ah, I see
So it's not so much about the organizations as it is just not completely throwing away stuff that could be useful going foreard
Add more tabasco
Do it or you're a simp
Its about the experience
Quick, tell me how to make a rocket
Now I'm thinking about dragonball fics where they actually use the dragonballs in a sensible way
I hate everything
No
No, we dont talk about GT
The premise is fucked from the start
Just besides myself thinking about it
<:drewkaS:469726574959394817>
He's still not over it
I dont go out on Halloween
Haven't dressed up in like a decade or so
Although
My gf has spoken in passing of dressing up as a witch and wizard
I'm sure he's stressed as fuck with the elections coming up
The fuck is raising arizona
Also isnt Hoosier a north midwestern thing
No not at all, lmao
I mean, it can still work
Just set it in rural indiana
BROTHERS...
PROUD....
that ship do be lookin kind of thicc tho
that ship do be lookin kinda thicc tho
that's kind of the thing, is the rapid switching of perspectives
i don't remember what the fuck is happening in whichever world this is
my complaint about this update is "vriska needs to go away"
that's about it though, everything else was decent-ish
no, i think vriska is a screenhog that's survived long past her due
she needs to be removed from the story, especially now that she has a fucking COPY of herself
ICE is a police unit in the united states that's in the news a lot for deporting illegal immigrants
mhm
presumably has to do with karkat and other trolls being treated as second class citizens and migrants
but the parallels aren't really there
poomp!
<@!207991389613457408> why does MJ12 bother operating in secrecy when their defining imagery looks like this
gimme some i need to see this

funnily enough i already know this song through chiptunes, i had no idea it was from deus ex
having a house feels like such a pipedream
at least what someone might call a "decent" house
i often fantasize about building myself a small cottage
buying some land and just spending time on getting it put together
that won't be for many moons my friend
for now, i continue as monke
lat's problem is that he exaggerate but thinks that what he's saying is completely on the level
qweq did you know that every american has been raised from birth to shove strange, miscellaneous objects in their assholes? then once a year we congregate in local covens to compare objects, and whoever went with the weirdest gets 100 bucks
america kind of sucks
i think qweq's statement was too much but it's not a stretch to say that america has some shit wrong with it
every country does
i mean... you can though
it's still not a coup but maybe you should be looking more at the meaning of what's being said
it's still really despotic and that's the part that matters
mail in ballots are only going to be a problem because republicans turned it into one, absentee ballots have been a thing forever and it wasn't really a problem before
but now you get people in the postal service literally dumping ballots in the trash, and WHOOP who could have guessed it they're a trump supporter
instead of complaining that it's not secure, _make_ it secure
it arguably already is
or, well
i guess it's not since you can have retards in low level positions fuck everything up because they don't agree with other people's opinions
but it doesn't help when you have dejoy restricting the postal service security from intervening and stopping that from happening
you guys know that the USPS has an extensive security wing whose sole task is to prevent male fraud and interference?
dejoy or someone literally told them "you cannot protect anything unless it's on USPS property" which defeats their purpose
oh shit i said male fraud
well, there you go
conversation ruined
i'll never forget when i was in california, before meeting up with tera
we went to a world market to pick up some snacks and the cashier was some dude who was blazed out of his fucking mind
his nametag said alaska
he looked at all of the stuff we had, rang it up and said "that'll be 15 trillion dollars hahahaha"
then we were like "oh yeah, this too please"
he said "oh well in that case it'll be 30 trillion dollars hahahaha"
i fucking loved that guy, gf was not so enthused about it though
she's on day shift right now, hardest schedule cuz she wakes up at 4 or 5 AM
october is her favorite month but she hasn't been enjoying it much cuz of that
her birthday is coming up so i got her something nice though
ya boiiiiiiiiiii
what are you doing at work, same ol' or something new
oh shiiiiiiiit
yeah, that's definitely worth raising a stink over
fuck those people
i don't think that "neglecting to inform students about a charge" is a progressive position
you are a wiener
yeah, i'm pretty sure they were lying to you
that's a bullshit reason even by my standards
it's called saving face
oh i am 'mirin'
it doesn't matter if i know what their "real intentions" are, i suspect that they're not being entirely honest when they say they completely neglected to tell you about a $3000 charge just because they wanted to avoid stressing you out
yes, i know
that doesn't really change my stance
i was saying general "you"
you FUCK
that's a lotta dimp
no, just like a box filled with glitter
something that poofs it out, yeah
i think any fireworks right now are a horrible idea given the incredible droughts
"What's in this box labeled 'ladybugs'?"
*opens the box\*
"I don't know what I expected."
isn't it a bunch of private landowners who don't consent to letting the government do that stuff?
yeah
kind of sounds like the state DOES have its hands tied, unless you want them to start eminent domaining the shit out of the place
galaxy brained libertarians at it again
oregon is... oregon
i want to take dero over to the west coast sometime to show her the redwood trees, maybe we'll take a detour up north to visit people <:thonklace:677200756440301569>
+logress
TOASTY BOOOOOOOOY
to be completely fair, i didn't remember that toast had changed his name until earlier this week
and i wouldn't have remembered if i hadn't clicked on his name and saw the little note i made
after all, no one is ever _really_ gone
sorry i was too busy putting shit on my ass

i want you to know that every time you ping me with that, it makes me smile
oh manm, finally
<@!153392726832840706> <:patrickboo:569927177525526538>
a ton of new spells and perks
some new enemies too i think
hades is pretty cool
play that
i went into it expecting not to like it for whatever reason and it's actually pretty fun
wow fuck you
see if i visit you next time i'm on the west coast
excuse me
i'm not a fan of gravy on fries
i've gone to canada twice, i'm okay with not having poutine
good question actually, i wonder when i'll go to mexico, if ever
i need to go on a world tour someday when i'm rich
just visit every lit regular and have a good time
patroclus? you take that back you fucking asshole
i haven't even met patroclus in the game yet, didn't know he was in there
just know in advance nost, that all i want in my food is meat and bread
and hot sauce
that's it
elvish
just kidding, it'll be atomicBinary again
didn't biscuit come back again??
pretty sure we let biscuit back
or did he get banned for being too stupid to be alive again
biscuit is a user we banned for literally being so stupid that it made chat stupider as a whole
that's literally it
oh yeah i forgot about that
it's hard to remember, thinking about biscuit makes me feel like my brain is rotting
because even if we disagree with your takes and you have a lot of highly overreactive stuff you say, you at least are capable of thinking
cohen was not based
<:gachiGASM:353818316046991361> is fine
gachispank is not fine
don't do it
yeah, same goes for ricardo's floppy junk
we don't tolerate horniness
it has no place in this server
dude, come on
don't make me fucking ding you
I'M GONNA DING HIM
I'M GONNA
that's why i wrote spat
actually a conversation like this one is precisely why i started hanging out in mspa-lit
and what led to me becoming a mod
and what led me to write spat in the first place
i was hanging out in <#152981670507577344> on one of my first nights and a bunch of then old timers came in and started talking with toast
their rapport reminded me of older internet communities i had been in, so i was like "this reminds me of stuff i used to be in"
i've been here since 10/25/2016
i didn't participate in the fandom at all until 2016, despite reading since 2012
i was still in undergraduate school when i first joined
now i have a master's degree
nah, that's april 2nd
wouldn't have been possible, server was created at the tail end of february
all we do is be sad that the official team is a bag of dicks
and also lament the general state of things
gen now is a fucking mess
it's not fun to be anywhere near it
i don't know how to fix it, either
well first of all, it's dead as fuck compared to how it used to be
second, it's become a hive of scum and villainy
yes, i am being vague on purpose
we've talked about gen in mod chat to a large degree and have not really come to any agreement on what to do about it
kind of sort of qweq
i'm mostly annoyed because it seems that the current brand of simping seems to crowd out other stuff
or i could be wrong
i don't know
we have identified the problem, idort
we're not sure what to do about it
i said i was being vague on purpose you fucking cock
not that i was being vague because i don't know what's going on
i look at gen often enough that i know what the deal with it is
if i'm going to fuck gen up, trust me, you'll know
for now, we have no plans
we just want it to be active and inviting to new members again
right now it doesn't seem that way
we should just turn <#152981670507577344> into <#694749061177147454>
forever
<:eddy:659154159169306644>
i've said it before but i want to be clear, literally every time i post that emote, i'm making that face in real life too
<:TenseiFace:243174946178596864>
it's right here
learn 2 fast cuil, it was good to see you
completely unrelated to the topic at hand, but am i a fucking idiot for loving the subreddit /r/comedynecrophilia
where they take bad memes and make them even worse
what the fuck are you talking about jesse
progress screen??
i don't know about this
i stopped playing noita after i finally managed to become a god and got a fuck ton of health/perks
i Won noita
wow yeah i've never seen that
https://i.redd.it/skg8572694731.png
suffer for your crimes

i honestly need to get to bed soon but i don't wanna
chat is interesting today
toasty made everything okay
child
mark collins, 45, gave himself over to the authorities after the incident. he is now serving a life sentence
would i!
would i!
would i!
you don't need validation, you're already valid king
mod team has been turned on its head and it's been interesting so far
not even chaotic just interesting
HONEY YOU MEAN _HUNK_ULES
ideally people want to be mods because they care about the community and its welfare
<@!468180578282373130> hangout got deleted for that reason and also because it was literally sucking the energy out of general, to the point that <#152981670507577344> had less than 100 messages per day at one point
as soon as we pulled the plug on hangout, general was resuscitated and things were fine
also i literally told you we have no plans
do you actually listen or are you actually just a thot with brain disease
...
what
are you fucking serious
how does this happen
why do you do this
<@!227181775221161984>
read above you fuck
stop spreading lies
i'll end you myself
it was me trying to freak people out for fun
why would you do this la2la
you have hurt me in a way that is profound
jesus christ i'm never gonna recover from this
change your avatar to a better authoritarian, like mao zedong
pathetic
there's only room for one lat in my heart
clean out the gunk while you're there
my cholesterol is apparently pretty bad
andrew, i will never stop eating meat
i will probably literally have a heart attack before i'll be convinced to stop eating meat
<@!468180578282373130> you're really cruising for a bruising matey
keep talking shite see what happens

the great ban hammerino finds its way to you
but not today
i am too tired
I AM TOO HOT AND TOO TIRED TO CONTINUE
i used to
not right now
it doesn't always work, but i really do need to poke my head in here more often
no, toast is a twink
i thought they stopped that stereotype ages ago smh
bro, we literally hung out, you can't fool me
bro...
why did that make me laugh
god i love this place
<:becomeBaby:530114746918240298>
i don't have any alcohol except stuff i'm saving for special occasions
i should change that but i need to take it easy on the vodka for a bit probably

"for the record" harpy, you are a wiener
i'm in homeless with a twin bed
just kidding i sleep in a pile of newspapers
and dirt
no, i got my master's degree
covid has affected me by making it impossible to find a real job
instead i moved in with my grandparents because my grandpa still works but my grandma is literally unable to take care of herself anymore
i'm effectively an in-home caretaker
they pay me a bit for it
it's very miserable but at least she has some like dignity
if i wasn't here she would literally just like
well, you know
it wouldn't be fun
that's good at least, yeah?
oh
lmao
wait okay what
you're giving me whiplash friendo
so just has outdated viewpoints
ah
that'll do it
it deserves death
hey, you asked
vvvvvvvvvvvvv fuck
you suck and you're stupid
except it's actually squiggly squirm saturday
get out
555-COME-ON-NOW
of course iti s, why is that even a question
same, except my eyesight isn't great either
oh yeah, i finally got a haircut
maybe i can do chad selfie too
it is a mystery
mine didn't turn out so well, but here you go

LOOK AT THE TOP OF HIS LIPS
i've returned to monke, after all
holy shit mines who do you remind me of
you remind me of fucking michael cera
i'm sorry mines but i'm losing my shit
this is the best day of my life
I'M SORRY
I'M SORRY MINES
IT'S TOO STRONG, THE RESEMBLANCE IS OVERWHELMING
nah, that's chin
<@!155401695138938881> i'm genuinely sorry, i don't mean to make fun of you
i'm sure you've gotten that four million times at least
it's happening

worst day of my "job" so far
just let me pass into non-existence
hurry up then
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
very good answer
what is, "no"
he stole the cookie from the cookie jar
i hate the job market
i've never despised anything more than working for a shit fuck boss
whatever form that may take
death
oh yeah she is
that sucks
wedding, more like covid party
i don't remember if ceru came back and did anything, our relationship with them is just generally very poor after everything involving the NSFW server
griever specifically came back to shit on this server and makin specifically, saying people shouldn't stay here
sky's takes are fucking bizarre and self-defeating
do it, i dare you
i could use some pocket change
you'll never get him back
accept your fate
it would be different if the authors weren't allergic to interesting plot developments
jamie that made me fucking laugh out loud, thank you
"most of the budget is going towards hiveswap act 2" good? that's what they should have been focusing on from the start
it's increasingly clear as time goes by that the team spread themselves way too thin trying to do multiple projects
at first it was just continuing hiveswap, which has been an ongoing endeavor for EIGHT YEARS
then they started fucking friendsim
once that was done they started pesterquest
then while that was STILL GOING they started homestuck 2
also good on them for fixing a minor visual detail
that's not sarcasm, i actually appreciate that sort of commitment
it means they kind of care
no jamie, we know nothing because the official team is dead set against being transparent with their audience because they want to avoid criticism
which, i mean, the homestuck fandom and especially us at times can get trenchant, so i don't know that i necessarily blame them, but it also makes things infinitely worse in the long run
well, before i wouldn't have been able to give you any sort of answer, because we just didn't know anything
now, i'm pretty sure the answer is piss poor management, aka andrew hussie
god, what a fucking shitfest
i keep trying to come up with reasons to even partially justify the way hussie was talking to us in the emails and remembering that particular exchange ruins it every time
in what fucking dimension do you need to exist to think that's a reasonable thing to ask from members of your fandom
still raises my blood pressure
it's almost like we've had a reason for being unsatisfied with how the official team tends to oeprate
and then they gave us ample evidence to that effect
there's three possible explanations i think
1) hussie actually didn't give a single shit about us the entire time and was just trying to get us to do what he wants (this is the worst faith take but i can't rule it out completely)
2) he has control issues stemming from a long span of time dealing with the homestuck fandom, which would kind of make sense
3) he has fucking terrible managerial skills and genuinely has no clue how to interact with people
i don't know what the reality of the situation is, but all i can say is that it must be rather dire
that's the general idea
i mean, you don't really need to
it's depressing as hell
holy shit, is that video edited or is it real
yeah interro, i've been there for the last three days
defeating a sandwich only makes it tastier
HOY-TAH-HOY-TOH
WHAT IN THE FUCK IS GOING ON
whoops caps but still
why was i pinged
biology stuff apparently
not every animal on earth has red blood but it's common enough
has to do with efficiency in oxygen carrying capacity
hemoglobin, what turns blood red, is highly effective for it
copper based molecules are slightly less effective if my understanding is right, but they're also more cost-effective in certain circumstances, which is why you got blue blooded animals like horseshoe crabs
i don't think bugs have "a blood hole"
they don't have an arterial system like vertebrates, instead they have this spongy-ish material that blood just sort of exists in
the respiration of bugs occurs through little openings in their exoskeleton called spiracles
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 'BOUT BUG ANATOMY
anyway i don't know what started the biology conversation or why i was pinged for it
is this about sexual dimorphism??
oh fuck no it's about trying to make sense of troll biology
that's a logical dead end conversation
urrg
pomeranians are weird dogs
my family has had three at various times
they're very cute and cuddly
got a mean streak in them though, like all small dogs
takes a lot more to get to it though, as opposed to chihuahuas
the worst junk food i've ever made??
i don't know, i usually don't _make_ junk food
cooking is reserved specifically for genuine food
i guess if we're stretching it, that candied bacon i make sometimes counts
yeah basically
if i just don't feel like putting up with food but i want something filling, rice is the way to go
i do occasionally eat entire loaves of bread just because i want to
mac and cheese is real food
what kind of fucked up conception of junk food do you have
what the actual fuck
that is NOT junk food
that's _real food_
you know what junk mac and cheese is?
how i survived a month of undergraduate school where i was super fucking poor was eating a box of that shitty kraft mac and cheese with no milk or butter, once every other day
THAT'S junk mac and cheese
holy shit that's a wonderful garfield variant
the sort of inventiveness we need in this day and age
i'm playing trimps game
what am i doing with my life
i love when anything represents video game controllers as just like four or five randomly colored buttons in no particular arrangement
it's how you know the person responsible knows jack dick about video games
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> perfect
that part of the show has always confused me
because he says "go to bed" at first but next thing she's in his fucking room
like, tell her god damn mom
i don't know, it's just fucked
you know, i think i agree with you nik
he fucked the president of his fan club
it's just more visceral because it's his sort of friend's daughter
whoops
i just realized i forgot to unban gnawms yesterday
i still feel bad for him in the same way i feel bad for anyone who's like trapping themselves in their actions
it's not anyone else's responsibility to truly get them through it, but it still sucks that they're in the tar pit, y'know
how much is one day's worth of participation here worth
like, four cents?
the worst part is that isn't even my profession anymore
i'm not hired as a dirt scientist
i'm hired as a fucking in-home caretaker
so i'm like an ex-scientist
yeah, no kidding
i can feel myself crumbling into dust
wow, you just got back
can't you hold off on posting furshit for like one night
<:kek:230307022598438912>
GUYS
HOLY SHIT
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
i mean, i kind of get the sentiment but it's a hilariously biased metaphor
who is saying this exactly, 0HP??
what a chode
time for futurama
makin didn't say the thing, i'm sad
it's like a reinassance
i didn't spell it right but whatever
pretty succint
lmao
"furrylatula" and "cronus stan" are practically synonyms
i can't fucking believe what i'm listening to
this channel is evolving into a higher form as we speak
our shitposts are becoming weirder, becoming stronger
you guys wanna see an code lyoko/alvin and the chipmunks fusion fic where the chipmunks are the ones who discover lyoko and they're all human sized?
that's one yes it's happening https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11447354/1/Code-MUNK

the word "bespectacled" is used literally 16 times in the first chapter

:bark:
no emotes? damn
fuggedaboudit
oh here
well, we're working on that
woc and nat work on the bot
they're supposed to make it so people can opt in to the stream role
for now we have to manually give it to people
misha does anime and cartoons
makin does a Main Stream and a Prestream
the prestream right now is futurama and the main stream is farscape
it used to be a bunch of other shit,
like, at one point we did avatar the last airbender as the prestream
it's been a whole fucking thing
do you want the role for misha's streams too
oh
we also have a Generic movie role for whenever i happen to feel like doing something random
like, we have the wallace and gromit shows lined up
not sure when we're going to do those
but we want to at some point
solid choice
ye
god, i love today
<:FeelsComfyPepo:332685201085825026>
yes
i mean, in real life today was fucking awful
but i've been watching the conversation and just basking in the feeling of 2017/2018
it's nice
same way i did
talking in chat often enough and not having dumb opinions
you wouldn't know anything about that latter point though
have at it nights
sometimes it's pretty funny
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
you have to put linky or it won't work
makin got banned, i left
why would i stick around in a place like that
fuck that lmao
this place gets called a clique a lot but that REALLY was a clique
i mean, it was aysha's personal server so whatever, but still
yeah pretty much
we're certainly not going to try and mend things anymore
no point, why bother
keep the employee who contacted us unmentioned, if you please
yeah, i feel similarly
friendsim was alright because it was new characters
in retrospect, pesterquest wasn't a good idea because it touched on established ideas and characters in a way that tried to fundamentally change them
and then they tried to handwave it by saying "differing timelines" or whatever fake homestuckian garbage
oh yeah, the new stonestuck update is fucking _amazing_
i want to meet this person and shake their hand

yeah, his official team is in fucking shambles like a few months after the emails came out
i'm starting to believe he really is just that bad of a manager
it would explain a lot
i mean, it's just blatantly ridiculous nights
it's hard not to dunk on him for it
like, how divorced from reality do you have to be to think it's a good idea
or rather, how high
it's near the very end
hence why shit broke down not long afterwards
i was tired and upset for obvious reasons at this point
oh yeah, that's right
happy borth lat
is it--oh shit
gimme a link
this panel made me literally laugh out loud https://mspfa.com/?s=36946&p=26
who the fuck made this? they're a god damn genius
<@!229907778800582656> i love you, make more things for us to enjoy
don't listen to radioactiveumbra it's fucking terrible
it's like someone figured out how to depict cancer in visual form
hoo boy
come back to us o
we miss you
what the god damn shit fuck?
the hovertext is "pass pass pass pass yes"

what the actual fuck have you stumbled upon?
how many of these ARE THERE
<a:think_vibrate:423261268015841290>
snatched the words right out of my fucking mouth
right, carlarc's bans are still in the system
they might show up anytime
it's in sight, linkybot sees it somewhere
i used to worry about that but as today has proven, we have people who will be gone for years and then come back
i'm starting to think "no one's ever really gone" is less of a meme and more the truth
what would even happen in litstuck though
like, what is the overarching story
we just kind of exist on a day to day basis
so maybe it'd be about us starting a session of SBURB and then stopping partway through just to casually exist together, talking about the merit of various things?
we all god tier and start critiquing literature forever
i'm not speaking in a practical sense carl
like, obviously, there's no chance it would actually continue
i'm speaking in the abstract you fuck head
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

WHAT'S MY NAME
SAY HELLO TO MY SBURB-BLEND

DUNC
please
hm
i almost just said, `if anyone here actually manages to make and finish a meaningful litstuck adventure i'd shove a lightbulb up my ass`, but knowing some of the people here i'm not willing to tempt fate
what, you gonna make like character concepts and art and shit?
be my guest i love that shit
i would read litstuck if we used tm's plotpoints
and vac's horrifically shitty memes
nat has to do art
her art is good
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
why _do_ we still have linkybot
the era of linky is over
I think the arrangement was that wed wait for a really big content update on scp
Did that happen yet
It's been several months after all
Either earlier this year or late last year
Rough life
Still worth playing every now and then though, if only to abuse the microphpne
STOP SHOUTIN' I'M NAPPIN'

the part about the hiveswap forums was not there
<@!207991389613457408> FUCK YOU REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
cy has already expounded plenty
the problem is that most of us, from what i can see, don't agree with the premise
if you want to consider that harassment, then so be it
i think there are other, far more concrete examples of harassment you could point to than this
on my list of examples of harassment against the main team (a list which does not exist because i don't obsequiously pay attention to these things), the engineer meme is somewhere near the bottom
fuck you tm i have to put up with your shitty discussions about how to determine if things are even real
you can put up with us discussing something that actually exists and that we all want to destroy i mean see succeed
<:howlow1:676839933754867714> <:howlow2:676840417328889962>
have two
but you see, if something is a minor irritation and i want to stop experiencing it, i can just call it harassment and there's no more room for discussion
+fuck
+fuckyou
+wiener
welp i'm all out of ideas
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
HE'S ON THE FIRST PASS
OH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK IT'S HAPPENING
sorry lat, you are objectively wrong here
at least in our modern conception of justice
intent is the different between manslaughter and murder
alright everytime you say that i'm going to ban you and edit your name to say "i am a big doo doo head"
does that sound fair
not gratuitously <:tenseiDistortion:347205248567345162>
yes
it will teach you that i ban you when you say dumb shit
it totally does though
like, what kind of usage is it
is it directed specifically at a person or is it used in a general context
these things _matter_
and saying that they don't matter for whatever reason is pretty damaging to discourse and progression
which some people do complain about, interestingly
toast, we all know what you're going to do
vote for trump, and then i want you to burn that ballot
or that, write in kanye
that sounds way more appropriate
fuck kanye
have a good time at work cy
we love you despite all of our arguments
i yell generally all the time
i'm yelling right now
can you hear it?
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
<@!133121291833049090> this reminds me of the banjo kazooie nuts and bolts demo, where you were initially restricted to the town square but could utilize underwater physics to break out of the demo barrier and explore the rest of town
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
IT WARMS ME A MAN
EEREREE
NOW SIX UP RULES THAT LEFT TO SHAME TODAY FIVE ONE TRY SIX ON JAV GET-GET
that's also fair nik
but
that never really occurred to me
i was just excited to be pushing outside of where i was meant to be
i've always really loved that kind of thing
beyond just experiencing a really good game, one of my favorite things to do is try to escape the confines of the map
i always end up doing stuff, it was one of my favorite parts of WoW
you needed a mount nub
i bet you got all the ladies in middle school
fuck, that shouldn't have made me laugh
_you're_ the height of comedy


in my heart
i wish i was drinky, i'm off for two days but i have no alcohol
at least, nothing i'm willing to drink right now
what, like, fucking delivered??
no, i don't imagine they do
i live 10 miles away from the nearest grocery store
oh, sorry, i "only" live about 5.5 miles away from the nearest grocery store
point is no, there are no alcohol delivery services in this area
i think point blank griefing like destroying peoples homes and stealing their shit is just terrible
even if one person gets enjoyment out of it, it fucking sucks
classy griefing is like leaving signs in peoples houses
and rearranging their stuff
fuck you
i love hearing about obscure glitches and tricks
i want this recipe book, it sounds like a good companion in times of hardship
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
yeah
a little sugar with that salt
fantastic stuff
nope, two
i'm glad the relationship is going well
asian food is pretty nice
my gf and i make beef bulgogi sometimes
i'm not used to seeing this kind of dynamic play out in here, it's been interesting
i'm not aware of more than one other relationship between two people i'd consider regs in here
ignore me, i'm being weird about people
yeah precisely woc
it's a shame, i wish i had had the chance to be a third wheel before leaving virginia
i could have crashed a date and really embarrassed the fuck out of both of you
oh man
i'm sorry toast but those words made me physically shudder irl
i love the people here but it being your only viable dating pool is like, damn
you're fucked
ez lyfe
i've invited my gf to talk here occasionally, and she wisely declines each time
i've since stopped asking, because i realize that would be an awful idea
i don't feel like answering four million questions about what certain things mean
also she pulled the gut punch the other day
i was relating something she was talking about to an event that happened here and she said, "no offense but no one's really known about homestuck since 2014"
i know, that's why it hurt
i was like, "damn, you right"
also she said "jade and dave aren't an endgame ship? wtf lmao"
"they really fucked up"
i mean, she stopped reading in 2014, she escaped
that's all you can really ask for
you want some fucking asparagus flavor carrot chips? japan's got your back
that's the face i make when i die
i don't think i get the point of the story
what about him being a nuisance means the other guys suddenly talked to him
first of all
do you prefer toast or kosh or does either work
daniel?
okay tktktktktk
second of all, why aren't you drinking right now
wait are you still underaged
well alright then i'll call you kosh instead
kosh is one letter away from kush and i find that funny
meetups so far have been very fun and i regret none of them
ehhhh
lat i'm gonna tentatively say no
it would be funny but also a gateway to disaster
i always enjoy talking to tensei, it hasn't happened enough for my tastes
do you see lat
do you see why we ignore people talking shit about us from the outside
they don't understand
the shit that happens here is _real_
two kinds of people
the first one andrew
it is very monotone in some respects
kind of level
spider i imagine your voice sounds exactly like that original clip of ugandan knuckles in the tank
this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvqC1EqWx0E
in spat i had originally included the rough geographical locations of people when i knew that info, but it was deemed too much so i stopped doing that
kosh your voice sounds vaguely dudebro-ish, like you have that swing to it where it sounds like you're about to dunk on someone for being an idiot, but you want everyone to have a good time about it
i think i need to stop pussyfooting it when i drink, i keep trying to be cheap and drink wine or do really cheapskate mixed drinks with crappy vodka
also yeah kosh
i had a real good time hanging irl
10/10 would do again
crappy vodka is vodka that makes me feel tired and have a headache instead of actually enjoying myself
if you're gonna talk with someone, you gotta put effort into it and make it feel like a real conversation
there's usually something interesting about everyone you meet, even if you gotta dig for it a bit
there's only been one or two exceptions to this and it's kind of bizarre to encounter, but the point is that it's rare
did you
ever talk with her about trying to speak up more consistently
lmao
god, i fucking hate that
it's just kind of embarrassing
i hate trying to hang out in loud places for that reason, i already have a hard time hearing people
going to a dance party? fuck no
why would you do that to yourself
just stop
the concept of helping people
against everything i've said, i find myself wondering exactly how a person like 0HP is molded into existence
he wasn't born like that, he had to go through x years of life and experience specific things to have these viewpoints
how the fuck does that happen
the average gorilla can benchpress upwards of 800-1,200 pounds
you would do well to be very afraid of them
you are a fucking fool kosh
that monkey would eat you sick ways to sunday
return to monke
"however monkeys don't have healthcare" made me laugh
kosh you ever see a hairless chimpanzee
this thing will eat your ass

monke could crush plate
that kills a lot of people in armor
i think about that a lot
i want a different species to have a similar level of intelligence
yeah, it would have to be something that doesn't occupy the same sort of territorial space we do
chimpanzees with the intelligence of humans would just start doing human things because they're already very similar to us
it would have to be something really different, like an octopus
look, starfish having a similar level of intelligence honestly wouldn't be a bad thing, they are very distinct from us and don't consume the same resources
i hate reddit sometimes
i just want to look at genuine content and once you get down far enough, every other post is porn
get this shit off my screen
i mean, i didn't think it would make it to one year
they're trying their hardest to prove us wrong
we'll just have to see what 2021 brings us
depends
without anymore shakeups of the official team, it could last a while
they're not exactly focusing on it super hard
there isn't much room for them to fall further
if they have another shakeup, it could very well die on the spot
well, APPARENTLY a lot of the funding from the patreon is going to hiveswap act 2
i don't know how much i believe that, but i fucking hope it's true
and it also makes me wonder why they're splitting their efforts between multiple things
they do not have enough people to tackle more than one thing
especially now with the team getting fucked up like it has been, or at least as it appears
thaaaaaaaaat's chronic mismanagement and caustic behavior from team officials for you!
you know what i'm more surprised by? the physical books getting dropped like a stone
i wonder what exactly is the reason for that
that'd have to be the only thing, yeah
i would have chalked it up to him not writing commentary fast enough but viz would probably whip his ass enough to get past that
what a fucking sorry state things are in
that would probably be one of the only ways that they could possibly inject new life into the property
besides, y'know, making something genuinely good
i think your project is more like embalming it so that the corpse at least looks pretty as its lowered into the ground
as it is right now, we're working with like a torso and three limbs
i have no idea what toby fox's attitude towards his fans are, and that alone is already better than what we've got
like, if you have a tendency to piss people off and make them not want to associate with you anymore, STAY away from any interaction with your fans
even if toby fox is a dick, which to all indications he's not, he's doing it right by staying kind of aloof
that was the impression i got too actually
indeed
well i mean, shit
look where we are
it feels like we've been vindicated pretty hard
and i don't want to hear shit about it being a self-fulfilling prophecy, like us being hard on it caused it to fail
that's bull shit talk
you have to say it three times while looking in the mirror
yeah, now all we need to worry about is infighting <:TenseiFace:243174946178596864>
you're going to get absolutely shit on bam
i mean, not by everyone, but by enough people
there was plenty of positive reaction to makin's archives but all it took was people on twitter getting pissed to make everything in february happen
just prepare yourself for that
^ that's the one thing that i can agree with, is makin should have done a better job asking for perms
in his defense he did basically as much as he _could_ insofar as reaching out to people
but if he didn't obtain explicit permission he should have been more selective about what he decided to keep in
like, tumblr commentary about stuff shouldn't have been kept in without explicit permission
yeah hb
hm
yeah, i don't agree with that lat
false equivalence
we're not talking about the authors, we're talking about their work
"nothing ever dies" is an unfortunate principle for people who want their stuff to be destroyed, but it's a good principle for just about everyone else, especially the farther down in time you get
i'm sure there's a lot of stuff from ancient cultures we've found whose creators might not have wanted it to persist forever
but those people are dead now and we learn a lot from them, so
intractable problem
Oh my fucking god
Dero and I decided to get up for a late night Taco Bell run
Felt snackish and she wanted to upload her first fishing vlog using the internet here
We get up to the drive through and I wanted to know if they still do steak, cuz I haven't eaten here in a while
I ask, and the person on the intercom is like "yeah, we dont stop selling beef at any particular time of day"
And then they start going on a fucking spiel about how they like steak better than the regular ground beef cuz it tastes better
This COMPLETELY caught dero and I off guard, to the point that were struggling to hold in laughter while we placed our order
Finally we burst out laughing and the poor guy was like "I-I'm just trying to help"
We tell him everything's cool and drive around, saying to ourselves "he is 100% high as balls right now"
We pull up to the window and are like "sorry man, we really weren't trying to make fun of you"
He goes "yeah haha I get it sorry, I'm just a little autistic"
"Oh yeah dont worry, I am too"
Internally, still trying to avoid laughing in his face"
All in all, a good night to run up to taco bell
He fell asleep on his keyboard
Can I get "dua" in chat
I'm fucking losing my shit
I'm to the point of laughing where I'm coughing and I feel like I'm gonna fucking hurl
Tonight has been fucking weird
Jesus christ why
man what a fucking great night
thanks cy wiener
fuck you
we'll never be free
once you get into less common questions of writing, it's kind of a matter of just going with what you think looks best and saying fuck it
no one actually gives that much of a shit about where the punctuation goes in a mixed sentence
it's kind of like with citations
the dirty secret is that the format doesn't actually matter as long as you're providing all of the information you can in a consistent manner
Not really
Look at the insane amount of cheap ass "X Simulator" games

holy shit, you're right
all of my hair just fell out spontaneously

my gf showed me that video of the kpop group performing in north korea and it just keeps cutting to members of the audience looking variously confused or disgusted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFAhfFnISQY
i don't know how real the threat is but i found it funny too
also i fucking hate you for this video
it's irritating the SHIT out of me
i need to listen to the real one
OOHUGH
OOHUGH
OOHUGH
OOHUGH OOHUGH OOHUGH
this song is only minorly ruined by the fact that this is the exact same sound effect used in LISA: The First where she vomits into a toilet
you know what this song always makes me want to listen to though?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQVsQsUmu-I
i'm fucking amazed by how the soundtrack makes use of all the dissonance
it's really impressive
Leave the music on. It's what he would have wanted.

we're getting close to a year since that stuff happened

mety didn't that stuff go down in september
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this is the deciding factor that caused the timeline split
we need to go back
i want you to know that when i saw "japanese dub al pacino" i LITERALLY laughed like "hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo"
it's also references in western or at least american culture that people are marginally aware of
how the fuck did they translate "say hello to my chocolate blend"
i mean, that by itself is bad enoguh
but as a reference to "say hello to my little friend"
it's like a fucking translation monster
mike stoklasa watching this movie and saying "they _literally_ put an advertisement in as a major plot point in this movie" will haunt me until the day i die
fuck "The Thing" we should just put on jack and jill as a halloween horror movie

i like that for some people on the show, they made sure they had the actual voice

Guys I'm in the city looking at stuff and I THINK that I'm looking at a line to get into a Trader Joe's
Is there any reason on earth for a trader Joe's to be popular enough to have a line
I almost want to go in just to see why theres a fucking line
I have never been to a grocery store with a line to go inside
That's fucking insane to me

What the FUCK
At least its moving quickly, we were twice as far when I started this conversation
Gf: "it feels like I'm getting on a ride at an amusement park"
I moved back home asswipe
Yes
No I'm in missouri <:HowHigh:424317169757716502>
Yes
But that's unrelated
<@195290352838508544> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VHg8d3k56g&feature=youtu.be
I would say standing in line to go to trader joes enhanced my experience by at least 50%
... you can definitely learn it
Tons of people do
holy shit i didn't realize the full fishing video was this long
dero only showed me a version that was like 2-4 minutes long
she's been wanting to get it put up online for a while
i had to go back to shopping at fucking trader joe's after i linked it, did people like it
it's a nice vid
oh
oh....
tommy's done it again
did you just say tayne?
now TAYNE, i can get into

i need to update the word count but it's probably not significantly higher than that
i haven't written a lot this year
maybe 50 pages
i think it's a fine title
point is that it's a fucking excellent quality fanventure so far
i hope it keeps going forever
okay sure, mr. fucking nitpicky
i know no one asked for this, but i was listening to the OH MY GOD JC A BOMB video and this is the original soundtrack used for it, so enjoy yourselves https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPjJW5iTFN0
oh shit it's been a while since i actually went and had a proper listen to most of these songs
i'll put that one on now
i can't remember the song that got me into caravan palace initially, but it doesn't quite matter when most of their music is this nice
solid head boppin
god, some real <a:duane:760147456938868786> shit
imagine being this much of a joyless snob
oh shit, i found the track that originally got me into it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yebo5ILBMC0
now this i can get into
pump this shit directly into my veins
interesting, i looked up "the auction chant" on wikipedia because of this and foudn this beauty
```On September 5, 2018, far-right activist Laura Loomer interrupted a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing about social media to voice concerns about possible left-wing bias on the part of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. She was asked several times to sit down or leave, before Congressman Billy Long (R-MO), a certified auctioneer and member of the National Auctioneers Association,[3][4] launched into an auction chant pretending to sell Loomer's cellphone which she was holding up to make a video. Loomer was escorted out and Long received laughter and applause from colleagues and attendees.```
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-a-fast-talking-auctioneer-turned-congressman-drowned-out-this-far-right-protester
i don't know much about congressman long, but his district includes springfield, branson, and joplin so it can't be good
jack dorsey, twitter's CEO
she was claiming that he was shadowbanning people critical of trump and trying to manipulate the election
```In September 2018, in response to sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Long retweeted a post comparing attempted rape to a "kiss on the forehead" on Twitter.```
well, there you go
yeah
he was defending kavanaugh's nomination by saying that the allegations of sexual assault are tantamount to nothing
yes, congressman long
politicians are rotten
https://i.redd.it/qsy5640q3eu51.jpg
doesn't sound familiar so let's say no
>grab it while it's fat
so FOREVER
i think this is the emerging story, really
a LOT of calls and advertisements saying "WE'RE HIRING" but then then no one actually gets hired
i can't tell you the number of times i've heard the organization in the city dedicated to this saying "WE'VE GOT THIS, LET'S GET YOU A JOB"
and then everyone i fucking know has no jobs
that's the spirit
that has absolutely happened i'm sure
but you know what? TIME TO RUIN MY SEARCH HISTORY YET AGAIN
```While a mother may benefit marginally from the nutrients found in breast milk, according to several lactation experts, a mother who drinks her own breast milk is exceedingly rare.``` this is basically the only authoritative statement i can find on the matter
shout out to this question posted on the CDC website though
i'm pretty sure that even biologically male people can breastfeed if the lactation cells are activated enough
"pretty sure" is very loose here, i'm not an expert
that sounds like bunk
oh
i mean, _anything_ in excess has the potential to be deadly
are you calling me fatal
correct lat
```Human male breastfeeding is possible, but production of the hormone prolactin is necessary to induce lactation, so male lactation does not occur under normal conditions.[6] Domperidone is a drug that can be used to increase lactation. Male lactation has also been seen during recovery from starvation. This may be because glands that produce hormones recover more quickly than the liver, which absorbs hormones, leading to high hormone levels.[7]

Spontaneous production of milk not associated with childbirth, known as galactorrhea, can occur in males and females.```
so just starve yourself near to death and then start eating like a fucking cow, milk will start shooting out like nobody's business
i thought it was fairly decent myself
although imagining tensei do an impersonation of immortan joe made me laugh
oh yeah, in that case i totally agree
@ makin F1X TH1S

wow, i'm ashamed to admit but a joke on /r/jokes actually got me just now

it just caught me by surprise

pretty solid contribution to science if you ask me
isn't that usually what blood drives are for? sudden crises?

or not donate it, but sell it

it took me less than 20 minutes
oh, platelets
yeah that's definitely different

if i can have it in little bits here and there over the month and like... use it as a mixer
man, i don't know
250 mL is enough where i'm like
"do i feel like choking this down once every ten years"
pureed baby
i'm just trying to figure out a way to make it as palatable as possible
because realistically, if literally the only thing that's stopping me from being _literally immortal_ is consuming a liquified baby once every ten years, i'm probably going to do it
but i won't enjoy it, and i really would prefer to be able to enjoy it
newborns don't know what they're getting into, if they did they'd consider it a favor
you also want to be a parent
that's fucked up
lat irl: I HAVE LEARNED HOW TO STOP PEOPLE FROM DYING

FUCK YOU FUCK YOU IN THE ASS

<@!125433170047795200> dude, this is fucking dangerous
when i drink vodka in general i just get kind of sleepy, but kamikazes turn me into a fucking animal
how did you figure this out
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
NONE OF YOU ARE SAFE
someone made this song in support of the "eat the eggs" cause, i'm pretty sure i pulled it off of the forums it was posted on just before that website died completely, and thus i have potentially one of the only copies of it left in existence

NO NO NO

you know, i bet with the internet it'd be possible to discover the rest of those pretty fucking quickly
maybe not immediately but certainly in a reasonable amount of time
how many
yeah, there you go
you need to post it on reddit or something, get a massive following
what even have been in the chests that were discovered though
this is the reality of what you grapple with tm

i want people to start talking about _something_ interesting in here
or else
what about it
you gonna cry
YOU GONNA EXPERIENCE AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS
SQUIRT ME A TEAR PUNK
it's something my gf says when she's feeling rowdy
she likes to abuse me, it's fun because she's half my size
i'm like 6'2, 6'3 or so
why would i bother pretending for any of you
this place matters about as much as my pinky toe
yes, we've been dating for around seven years
no, she wants to be a diplomatic consular
i met her in my first year of college
18
it's getting on eight years now
will be in june
we don't live together, things have never really been stable in terms of living conditions
i moved away from home for three years for graduate school and she suspects that she'll _always_ be living abroad once she becomes a diplomat
i think we're okay with that at this point
we've had lots of practice
mhm
we only saw each other twice a year at most when i was getting my degree
living 14 hours away from each other does that to you
it's okay, now we're only 20 minutes away
because it's

you know what?
fuck it
i'm getting more kamikazes
it's time to get fucking wild
you're all fucked
it's equal parts vodka, triple sec, and lime juice
you can't even taste the alcohol but it hits your stomach like fire
i had the equivalent of one of those little lime juice things you get in the produce section and i still feel wired to the wall
holy shit mint did you actually go and read that whole thing
when i had my religious awakening while i was still drunkenly passed out on the toilet
god that was an incredible night, i felt like shit
<@!108778093631533056> no occasion, i'm just off work now and i felt like getting fucking lit
life is short
i'm gonna make it shorter
lint is apparently my nickname
i'm down for that
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
time to go get that drink
<@!125433170047795200> you're responsible for whatever happens once i'm fucking blasted
god, i almost feel worried that i've distributed that screenshot but you know what
it's just kind of whatever
shroom just don't start drinking
that's all it takes
if you don't start drinking you'll never wake up on your bathroom floor after 3-4 hours, shaking from the cold
moderation is for my fucking sphincter
alright for real getting my drink now
batten down the hatches
soundtrack to me mixing my fucking demise https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpxLaTsylBU
<@!613572872673296395> i've never had an obama advice dream but i once had a lucid dream where i spoke to robin williams
this was after he died i think, so it was pretty freaky and sad
he even said "oh goodness, it's been so long! i'd been hoping to see you again one of these days"
god i miss robin williams
b3es, do you feel up to watching a video about 25 minutes long involving robin williams
you're welcome mint
i'm glad we could entice you to stay, you've been a wonderful addition to The Crew
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvPxRyIWWX8
enjoy my friend
robin williams is already an incredible human being, craig ferguson is one of the only men i find myself attracted to because he's fucking smart, earnest, funny, and witty as all get out
i fucking love craig and the world will shed a tear on the day he dies

<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i had sake once at a hibachi restaurant and it was the smoothest alcohol i've ever had
it was like water
yeah
but it also made me feel _weird_
it wasn't like a typical drunkenness
it was like half of my brain was looking at reality through a film of water
yeah, she still needs to pass her test and become a jedi knight
hope she doesn't run into any skeevy snivvians

i started saying some shit and she was like "wow, you know so much about these things, did you go to college"
"... yeah... i got a master's degree"
i took a break and got some tea and came back, she was asking about grandma's medication and i was all like
"OH YES she was taking olanzapine recently, it's apparently for schizophrenia"
it took all my effort to not sound like a posh british twat
this story was funnier in my head
i return to my kamikazes
oh no

<:GONE:696509069233487972>
you know, sometimes i envision online chatrooms as little slices of the afterlife where people can congregate and talk about things indefinitely
it's always weirdly devastating when people actually do disappear forever
like, i wonder where they go and what they're doing
the severance of contact in a world like this one is always a cause for sadness
gives me nightmares
no watch this instead
i think it might be 21 everywhere now
i'm definitely not sure about that though
yeah, see
that's a trump thing
people will differ based on how good an idea it was
in terms of health i think it's a good idea, in terms of individual freedom obviously it's not
if it's in the name of legalizing pot then so be it
as for drug admins, well
i will refrain from explaining my past
you can't afford to dream lat
sorry, them's the breaks

10 bucks is like ass pennies these days, not really
i was referring to the moral degradation more than anything
remember kids
it's not cool to be a scumbag
try to avoid hypocrisy and self-centeredness
god, when are we watching brave little toaster again
fucking fantastic movies, in different ways
holy shit spiral
we're gonna have to watch them sometime
they're fucking ridiculous
i mean, look at the super highway music video
it has computers with tits
it's _fucked_
the original movie isn't like this at all btw, it's like actually a genuinely good movie
with artistry and emotion and themes and shit
the sequels are free-for-all batshit insane mockfests though
lmao, what
who is this
an SO?
i don't think i have an appropriate "aww" emote
pretty solid reaction though
is she into the first movie at least

i am down for a stream of the original brave little toaster movie literally any time
it's one of those things that's like the definition of "soul" in a piece of media
you can tell that every single person involved in its creation actually cared about the product they were making
a concept that i feel is at the heart of what we talk about and do here
man
fuck makin's shill list
what we need is the layman's shill list
something that can touch the heart of the average person, instead of just stupid rationalists
brave little toaster would fit on there of course, as well as something like
like
land before time
both excellent additions
i've never seen last unicorn either
maybe it's something we should do one of these days here
```‚ÄúCroesus, king of Lydia, asked him as follows: ‚ÄòAthenian guest, much report of thee has come to us, both in regard to thy wisdom and thy wanderings‚Ä¶ a desire has come upon me to ask whether thou hast seen any whom thou deem to be of all men the most happy.‚Äô This he asked supposing that he himself was the happiest of men; but Solon, using no flattery but the truth only, said: ‚ÄòYes, O king, Tellos the Athenian.‚Äô```
```Croesus, marveling at that which he said, asked him earnestly, ‚ÄòIn what respect dost thou judge Tellos to be the most happy?‚Äô And he said: ‚ÄòTellos, in the first place, living while his native State was prosperous, had sons fair and good and saw from all of them children begotten and living to grow up; and secondly he had what with us is accounted wealth, and after his life a most glorious end. For when a battle was fought by the Athenians at Eleusis against the neighbouring people, he brought up supports and routed the foe and there died by a most fair death; and his people buried him publicly where he fell, and honoured him greatly.‚Äô [‚Ä¶]```
```Croesus was moved to anger and said: ‚ÄòAthenian guest, hast thou then so cast aside our prosperous state as worth nothing, that thou dost prefer to us even men of private station?‚Äô And he said: ‚ÄòCroesus, thou art inquiring about human fortunes of one who well knows that fate is apt to disturb our lot. For in the course of long time a man may see many things which he would not desire to see, and suffer also many things which he would not desire to suffer‚Ä¶ As for thee, I perceive that thou art both great in wealth and king of many men, but that of which thou didst ask me I cannot call thee yet, until I learn that thou hast brought thy life to a fair ending: for the very rich man is not at all to be accounted more happy than he who has but his subsistence from day-to-day, unless also the fortune go with him to possess things of value. For many very wealthy men are not happy, while many who have but a moderate living are fortunate‚Ä¶ But we must of every thing examine the end and how it will turn out at the last, for to many fate shows but a glimpse of happiness and then plucks them up by the roots and overturns them.'‚Äù```
yeah, sorry

that's a quality screenshot
the best screenshot i have is from the last time i got this drunk and posted in woc's private server, in his #posts_while_shitting channel
it's like a window into the mind of a man who's at his nadir
do you want me to send you this screenshot
that's not entirely accurate but sure
i got so drunk on sangria one night that i was basically communing with the universe and regained my sense of humanity
it's an epic journey of self-discovery and wine
yeah
that was a real experience i had
can't believe it's been almost two months
that was the beginning of september
it's not the first time i've had that experience, but definitely the first in a while
i'm glad my drunken spiritual awakening could move you so deeply
that's pretty sad
i'm kind of a failure
wow
you know what neth
you've inspired me
i'm going to get so fucking drunk i pass out on my bathroom floor _again_
in seriousness, i appreciate that more than i can say
i'm trying my hardest every day to be a decent human being and i'm gonna keep at it
if i can inspire people to be better and help them look upwards in their lives then by all means
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> okay, disregard, get smashed constantly
you know, in a fucked up way i don't even regret those nights
like, at the time it's easy to think about it in terms of "god, i'm repulsive and i suck"
but it's also humanizing in the sense of "i wonder how many other people have experienced this"
and i don't mean at this point in history, i mean across all of humanity
i bet the number is easily upwards of millions
this is just one kind of experience that we as people experience
it connects you to others who have experienced similar across the gulf of time
do you know how many people have ever been alive
I DIDN'T SHIT MYSELF

whenever i manage to take a vacation to brazil
approximately 1% of the population of the world is affected by "alcoholic disorders," which includes "drinking excessively"
there have been an estimated 100 billion humans to have ever existed
so
from this data we can suggest that up to 1 billion humans have had this experience
indeed
people have been getting wasted since time immemorial
yeah that exact line has been pulled by linky before, holy shit
I DID NOT
all i did was get really fucking sleepy and pass out on my bathroom floor
i only took a shit once i woke up and got on the toilet

you know, upon thinking about it, i think i like the end of samurai jack season 5 even less than i already did
the logical conclusion of him going back to the past is the exact same as if he had done it at any point he had access to a time portal in the rest of the show
i'm specifically thinking of the episode where he finds an enclave of xaolin monks who recognize him based on internal hand signals\
they agree to bring him to a nearby time portal but he decides to forego going back to the past in order to save the life of someone from the future
AND YET
ONCE HE FINALLY GETS BACK TO THE PAST
IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT EVERY SINGLE INTERACTION HE HAD IN THE FUTURE CEASES TO EXIST
i guess there's no way he could have known that would be the outcome, but STILL
i guess that's what happens when you need to come up with an ending for your show and don't have as much time as you should to do it
did i interrupt your spiel tm

<@!117481170228346880> do you ever feel shame in the deference you pay to this transparently obvious conman
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
CUT HIM OFF
TURN THE MIC OFF
TURN IT OFF
I HATE YOU
TURN IT OFF
FUCK
FUCKING HELL THESE MODERATORS ARE USELESS
GOD
DAMN
I HATE IT
"here's what the deal"

WHY FIND OUT
I HAVE TO RESPOND TO THAT he says, literally whining
WHAT
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
trump doesn't even fucking know where this money is coming from
i'm fucking losing it
i mean, to be fair, this debate is still a fucking farce
MALARKEY
or, you know, the impoverished people who can't afford... food
MUTE HIM
MUTE HIM
STOP LETTING HIM INTERRUPT YOU

lmao
yeah this is the last debate before the election day
kosh, you're delusional

I FUCKING HATE YOU
USE THE MUTE
USE THE MUTE
MUTE HIM!
WHAY
WHAT
SHUT IT OFF
SHUT THE FUCKING MIC OFF
IM FUCKING OUTRAGED
SHUT HIS FUCKING MIC OFF
lmao
i like how he enunciated "legislature"
it's like a 5th grader learning a new vocab word
no, he was drawing a comparison to how america cozied up to the third reich before the outbreak of the second world war
saying that cozying up to north korea is a bad idea
now THAT is delusional
that they might have the house of reps
the senate maybe
but the house?? i'm fucking losing my mind again
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
sigh
obama just sighing and drinking another apple cider
i mean, i hope so
be fair
settle down moon
THE HORROR
MANDATED MEDICINE
man
this may be an inopportune time
but i think it's high time that we unveiled our latest plan
MAKINCARE
what????
real question: what the hell is he talking about?
WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE
HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOCIALIZED MEDICINE
okay he's said "come on" too many times
stop doing it biden
MUTE HIM
MUTE HIM
"YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES BEFORE I ADD YOU TO THE LIST OF NSF CASUALTIES."
COME ON
take a shot every time he says come on
oh my god
so
it's okay that i can starve if giving me some money to compensate for covid also gets money to illegal immigrants
WHICH
ISN'T EVEN TRUE
i fucking hate this man
the sooner he's out of the picture the better for everyone else
hashtag "where's our bailout"
that could actually be vaguely trendy
MUTE
HIM
uh
AS STRONG A BORDER AS EVER HAD
did you guys ever see that video of a literal 4 year old climbing the fences that trump put up on sections of the border
THROUGH COYOTES
who oversaw those cages
"they're fish."
WE'RE BACK TO THE MURDERERS AND RAPISTS RHETORIC
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MY GOD
uh
i'm fucking losing it
holy fucking shit i'm losing my mind
holy fucking shit i'm just
i am cackling
irl
what a fucking bizarre soundbite
POSSIBLE EXCEPTION

i mean, i hate her thorough lack of the use of the mic mute, but at least this mediator is keeping things moving

i want that brown rice

RENT FREE RENT FREE RENT FREE
oh fuck
inject that shit directly into my veins
i need it
it's good food
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
<@!117481170228346880> really
like, i get your distaste for biden
i really do
i don't even like him myself
but how do you prefer trump over him
trump is like the definition of a scummy piece of shit
he lies about literally everything and cares about no one but himself
it's despicable
charging stat--ah, i see
i keep forgetting electric vehicles are a thing
but why
if i indicate to you that someone is clearly a chronic liar and a cheat and a thief
why doesn't that sway you
how are you not influenced by the fact that someone is transparently an evil, self-serving piece of shit
AOC + 3
WHAT
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

i would question what it means for it to be a debate
they interrupted each other plenty

not enough people like bernie i'm afraid
leave me out of this

NOW
i'm going to keep my eye on this while i play deus ex because fuck's sake, i haven't laughed this hard in a whiel
he needs to start making some kind of porn immediately, it's been a lost opportunity for the last 30 years
the "giant piece of hypocritical narcissistic piece of shit" genre has been left unfilled for a while
BIG
BIDEN
MILKIES
i'm fucking choking
no i'm good it's just time to start deus ex
i've forgotten the debate after starting up deus ex
has the populace voted yet as to who has won over the other
i wasn't seething really, i was taking the piss
don't get me wrong though
i don't like biden particularly much, but i prefer him to someone who would openly dispose of me if it meant they got even a little bit of money
kosh, i guess i'm just confused as to your priorities
trump clearly does not give a fuck about you
biden is... not much better
but he is indisputably the lesser of two evils
how can you justify going with the clearly worse option
i see
i don't know, i guess for me the deliberation is over
i can tell when someone is haggling with my life is all i can say about it
kosh, we haven't truly been on lockdown at _any point_
i'm speaking as a missourian but there was literally no period of time here where we could have been said to be under lockdown
people were "encouraged" to not go out but there was no real punitive measure for anyone to actually go into lockdown
if that had actually been enforced we might not be in the position we are now
red states have been handle with kiddy gloves to the point that it's adversely affecting everyone
we had like
_one day_
where people didn't go outside for anything
my parents described it clearly: "there was no car on the highway and all stores were unavailable"
then after that, everything is basically business as normal
i've basically been able to carry on business as normal, and hypocrisy called out i shouldn't have been
this has been handled in the worst way possible
dude
people have been using trump's mentality as an excuse to ignore directives against going out since day one
harsh
<@!207991389613457408> THIS IS A PUBLIC CALLOUT

LOOK
DO NOT SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY
god i wish i could sneeze
yeah
god
i'm trying to find a way to describe this
there's a list of "most pleasurable activities" somewhere
sneezing is honestly quite high
yes
it is
sneezing triggers a pleasure response
tm, you're inhuman
lay in the dirt
prepare for the end of your existence
i swear to god, there was a scientific study that suggested sneezing was within the top ten actions that were deemed "most pleasing"
i last heard about this when i was in high school so i could be wrong but i am extremely drunk and playing deus ex so don't @ me

TO THE POINT that i would be willing to try and fuck around on a livestream despite the fact that my internet is SHIT
i have been in all three rooms or whatever that theyt're indicating i need to go to
but i cannot find th way forward
at one ppoint i got shot and died and i assume that was the right way but
i cannot do it again <:sadCherub:347205248038862859>

no, it was closer to 100 people
i literally keep track of this on a day to day basis

misha what is that character
what are they from
yes, i was going to say that i see the character(s) in like future funk music videos sometimes
one in particular i like very much, let me go find it
this show looks cute
is it good
i thought i had liked this video, guess not
the one thing i hate about A E S T H E T I C is that it makes it nearly impossible to search for songs
HE'S DRIVIN' OVER THAT CLIFF--**AAAAAAAAA**
i _still_ can't find that song i was looking for, but this one is just as good so have it instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mS9TY2dNRk

live action char aznable looks like he gets a kick out of telling people puns
back into deus ex i go
oh, shit
i finally got it downloaded but i have not sent it out to people, sorry
after looking at it though, i think everyone will be delighted
just go with it

that was fucking great
i don't find the severe differences in form that absurd
butterflies already exist
they literally turn into a goop while they undergo metamorphosis
bugs are pretty malleable creatures
someone asked me that recently in gen
the answer is no, i've never made a trollsona
it felt a bit too much like roleplay for my comfort
i've entertained the god tier stuff but never bothered to do a troll
i guess what i'm saying is that i'm not interested
my classpect has changed over the years, i originally preferred heir of mind but then at some point it was knight of mind, and now it's probably something else
possibilities include seer of light or blood, knight of life, i don't know
i haven't put that much thought into it for a while
extended zodiac is whatever
i can't imagine they're making that much money off of it
the worst thing about it is that it's yet another example of them prioritizing the wrong things
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
"what's your extended zodiac"
"... sixty nine"

it even has the fallopian tubes and egg sacks
i'm impressed
i don't know what to do now

whatever extended zodiacs correspond closest to the aspects of time and space, those are the ones you're going to see the most

jesus, why has linkybot been pulling these out so often lately
surely not this much though
if i had to wager a guess as to the proportion of my messages that are genuine homestuck sulking, it would probably be like less than 10%
less than 5% even
<:drewkas:684981372678570023>
no, that latter message is ALSO homestuck sulk, but like a prelude to it
oh, right, how foolish of me
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>

it's not, just click it
this is one of the best fake songs in existence
i call it fake because the guy who wrote it and performs in this video is like some kind of australian comedian who did it as a joke
oh shit, that's 2004?
these guys did a fantastic job of making it look crusty as fuck

maybe with the sequel out i should change that
all i know about it is that ron paul called him a fucking fairy

```Kazakhstan is beautiful nation that have location very convenient in middle of Central Asia - with countries of Turkmenistan, Kyrgistan, Tajikastan (and shitting peoples Uzbekistan) all reachables within 100 days of travel. Although it size third biggest country in world, Kazakhstan only have ranking number 62 in population (7 millions people), meaning there is only 2 person per square kilometer (except for in Almaty jewtown, where there is 7 person per square metre)```
what the fuck?? <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
we should watch this sometime
it sounds ridiculous
if only makin and misha weren't hogging all the good stream times
i say as they reduce the amount of time they spend streaming stuff
how does sacha baron cohen exist
i feel like he's a manifestation of nonsense
are we talking about gloves used specifically whilst eating ice cream, or gloves literally made of frozen ice cream that melt as you wear them

i wasn't able to play today because i was out, and then when i got home i figured out i haven't even fucking installed tf2
i'll have to do that before next friday
oh fuck
that's going to be intense
i do hope we find a way to keep the SS13 server going
it always feels bad that it drops off in activity after the first few weeks
gotta find a way to get a greater number of experienced players in, to keep things moving
most of us are too fresh and stupid to actually stop anyone who knows how to work the game properly
what did it mean by this
apparently not
the scenario didn't leave much wiggle room
you must consume a baby, without significantly altering it in a way that might detract from the experience of Eating a Baby
you have to do it once every ten years in order to retain your immortality
it's not specified, that part is kind of inconsequential
sometimes in order to better understand humanity, you must plumb its depths
i mean,i think my response yesterday was arguably worse
where i said "the babies don't know what they're in for, really we're doing them a favor"
regular or modded
oh yeah, you had never done it before right
isn't it like 1 AM over there
you should go to bed, get some rest and start on it in the morning
i wanted to be asleep like three hours ago but i'm a sack of shit

funny how that works
flashbacks to when i tried to set up a php database so i could manually create a visitor's section of the website
and i gave up because i'm lazy and at a certain point it felt like i was getting tangled into a nightmare of instructions
php databases probably aren't all that hard but formal schooling makes things a lot easier for me
b3es coming in here and flaunting these workarouds
don't you know what this place is
that was your _first_ mistake

i didn't get pinged with stats today

that happened to me too nik
it didn't take quite an hour, but i had to leave the page up and eventually
EVENTUALLY the flash showed up
bwee
join the stream
it's great
also i hope we get something cool today
i'm speakin generally
you are wieners
but fair
no
i feel you lat
yes
we don't even know if it is in fact hiveswap act 2
just rein it in until something actually does happen
agreed, i enjoy it even more on each subsequent rewatch
pretty slow for a community stream unfortunately
wow, makin has shit taste
who's surprised
WOW
HOW DID YOU HATE ALL OF THESE THINGS
and you call yourself a rlm fan
mike and jay would be so disappointed
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
<@!131650004606648320> you're missing troll 2 my friend
chat is loving it
YOU CAN'T PISS ON HOSPITALITY, I WON'T ALLOW IT !
just because the director claims it was meant to be bad on purpose doesn't actually mean they did it on purpose
```Despite the majority of the cast ascribing to the same story, Fragasso has vehemently denied their version of events, and once reacted angrily to a panel discussion being conducted by the cast, calling the actors "dogs" (Italian for "bad actors"[8]) and accusing them of lying about their experiences.[6]```
it really is just that good bad
what a fucking bizarre movie
yeah, i can't remember the ending so i hope it finishes alright
ARE YOU READY KIDS
troll 2 needs to be a 10/25 tradition, that was great
if all you saw was the ending, you saw basically nothing
it was first announced in like... january of 2018 wasn't it
advertised for spring that year
then the last official news we had was like a year ago?
am i remembering the timeline right
fuck you leatherman
<:monkaOMEGA:663106010344587279>
IT'S HABBEDING
for me, this was the real event of today
i mean, this is going to be how i reread the comic from now on
man, we were watching meme vids earlier today and for the briefest second i got hit by that spark of "i love this" again
which one is that again
fuck, he put that in the actual shills list
makin you fucking wiener
i completed the shills list a second time months ago, caught up with everything, and you didn't put me on the completionists list
now i have to finish reading chili too
fucking REEEEEEEE
it's at the bottom of the shills
it's 7 PM EST, so going by that metric it'll be another 5 hours yeah
an external hard drive is actually pretty useful in specific cases
i wouldn't recommend it as your personal, constant-use storage
i didn't read ever17 twice, i just completed the shills i hadn't read before
i am not using google drive to transfer the entire contents of my hard drive from one computer to the other
it's not even remotely feasible
i have like almost 1.5 TB of files on my computer
^ i actually made a habit of replacing my hard drive with a laptop SSD
i should probably figure out how to do that, yeah
i've been using computers my whole damn life and i still use inefficient methods for stuff
i need to find an IT job
my external HDD is like 2 TB and i bought it back in...
jesus, like 2013 or something
it's old
i need to get a new one
nah
i mean, i've only built two computers
with the first one i just sold the entire thing to dero
transferred all of my files over and gave it to her blank
which
i still need to fix that
when are you giving me the SDD so i can reinstall windows
yeah i know how to fix it
i keep asking for it and you're like "NAAAAH"
"DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT"
"I'LL JUST KEEP USING MY FIANCEE'S COMPUTER"
like, fuck you, i'll drive over with a W10 boot disk right now
LET'S DO IT MOFUCKA
the only part of building a PC that's actually really scary is the CPU
all those little pins
and if you bend them you fuck it up
i'm working tomorrow unfortunately
look, it would honestly only take like an hour for both of you at most assuming there's no big problems
holy shit wada i would be so <:monkaOMEGA:663106010344587279>
bending one of those CPU pins is like a personal nightmare
wat
<@!153392726832840706> delete that right now
anyway dero come on, let me just drive over
i've been stuck inside all day watching the 10/25 stream
i could use a little bit of time out of the house
we have plenty of time to play 7d2d
your hosue is always a mess you dumbass
that's what happens when you have 4 billion pets
alright i'm heading out
wait, what
oh
not the SSD but the HDD, okay
are ALL of the sata cables in her computer now
or do you at least still have the SSD connected
that's literally all we need, you can get your own HDD later
might honestly be preferable
one more time
it's all connected
<@!146014279529791488> look, i'm just gonna come over, if nothing else doc still needs the damn boot drive
also i'm fucking weirded out about how frequently the bot posts hs2 sulking
maybe i just complain way too often
w-what bag
also i have some fear for hiveswap act 2
the screenshots are...
they indicate that it'll have a mystery section
and also there's suddenly a time limit for joey and dammek switching places
i guess we'll just have to see how it pans out
mission accomplished
depends on which coincidences you're talking about
wait, what the fuck does that mean
<@!133121291833049090> what the fuck is that person even talking about
too much coffee is bad
when i first started drinking caffeine this year i got fucking energetic as hell
but i'm also chronically tired and have no motivation
so i'm not sure if the energetic state was how people feel normally
i can imagine it would lead to unpleasant effects in people who are already usually energetic or active
also yes tori, i'm still uzzled why you pinged me with it
it's like... cursed vegetable
y u do dis
what's this i see about the squiddles album being missing
does it literally need to be ON BANDCAMP? because i see it on youtube with no issue
same for the wanderers, which even has the track art for each song
yeah, i was just confused by all the talk of them literally being gone
like, why couldn't someone just upload these tracks into a non-profit bandcamp page and link to that instead
```I've just been informed of the release of this unofficial archive, and this partial feature list gives me a prodigious amount of questions about their idea of what definitively is and is not "Homestuck".```
yeah, i was wondering when bam would start getting people like this
what a crock of shit
i have no idea who they are, my brain space hasn't cared about those kinds of details for a while
it's either an official team member or another random sanctimonious fool
make the tweete nik, become thine own worst enemy
LET 'ER GO
THEY'LL NOT HARM US
any significant complaints
i see some praise and i'm happy about that
<@!257144766901256192> yeah i'd hang out with you for at least a bit
i doubt you're actually as obnoxious irl as you make out with yourself to be
i mean, make yourself out to be
it's a homestuck reference dunkass
jade harley?
janine
anyway
nat we'd just get like soda or something
wait, would we be hanging in america or your area
if you were here i'd take you to a soda bar
if it was there, i have no fucking idea what we'd do
sol i've hung out with about a dozen people from the HSD at various points
yes
i met four of them in california alone
i can hit on ANYONE I WANT
i do not want to hit on nat
she's a gremlin
i can hit my way into a near eight year relationship with someone i care about very deeply, i think that's better than an unspecified proportion of people who use this server
uh
it's not a long distance relationship though
i mean, i guess it was for a few years while i was in graduate school
but i moved back home
that was six months ago <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i didn't realize that may and november were only two weeks away from each other, damn
may? you mean 2015?
i do not recall the passage of time anymore
i have become a pod person
we just make fun of nat being short because she reacts badly to it
it's called hazing your friends
yeah exactly
apparently people are already creating mods for the unofficial collection
someone in gen linked a project dedicated to "removing all slurs" from it
yeah, they made a big deal out of it, which is why i found it weird
someone in the comments also said "get rid of june's dead name please"
which, okay
yeah, i'm not like
upset
i was just pointing it out here
it seems weird to me that people care that much but who am i to judge, we have our idiosyncrasies too
i mentioned this earlier, but
the only thing that's stopping the squiddles and wanderers albums from being referenced is that they're not currently on bandcamp, right
those tracks are all available on youtube, what's stopping anyone from reuploading them to bandcamp, including a free download link and saying THIS IS A REUPLOAD FOR NONPROFIT PURPOSES
the wanderers album even has all the track art
do what lofam did, set the price ludicrously high, put a disclaimer that they're actually meant to be for free and include the download link
suck u
yeah
so like, all of the music is preserved just fine
we would just need some brave, intrepid soul to make a ripoff bandcamp
unless bambosh feels like adding the ability to stream directly from youtube, that's what we'd have to do
i don't blame him
look, how about i contact my friend brew drinky and see if they want to set up a bandcamp
they said yes, if that would help
cuz we'll kill her if she's mean
brew drinky wants to know why
alright, well
brew drinky is too wasted to give a fuck right now unless they get the go ahead from bam, so they'll just wait for now
i'm not drinking, what are you talking about
do you have me confused with good old brew
go home cy you're hammered
i still can't understand how people enjoy beer
like, is it possible for people to enjoy outwardly bitter things
i've tried many kinds of beer and they all taste like fucking dirt to me
and not the good dirt either
that's right i beat you to it fuckers, shut up
good dirt is still bitter but less markedly so, like if bad dirt is bitter like coffee then good dirt is bitter like sesame seeds
it also has more definition to it, bad dirt is very dusty while good dirt has volume and moisture throughout
it's still true every day
i'm getting better though, sometimes i don't pick up that take
you gotta take some of the biosphere with you, you can't just transport your food all the time
not cost effective
how you gonna know how to grow food properly elsewhere
your joke SUCKS
GET BETTER MATERIAL
"many" makes it sound like a significant amount of the content is actually problematic
what slurs are used except for the future arachnidsGrip joke and also debatably whenever they say "retard"
so like... three or four words?
oh yeah, forgot about that magi
the text is all in a json file isn't it
can you do a quick ctrl+f to see exactly how many there are
i don't mind if they pursue the project, i'm not denigrating them for doing so
i don't agree with the idea but it's their choice
no we haven't jamie, what the fuck are you on about
yeah but it's only been brought up sporadically
pay more attention
come off it, our discussion of this has been perfectly fine
the mere presence of this conversation is not a problem, the purpose is to discuss it like literally anything else
seriously, you're being weird about this
sanctimonious maybe?
anyway, i know for a fact that qweq probably supports the endeavor, she hates what they view as slurs too
shut up servant
i'm short on patience today
uh
the "real campaign" against it started many years ago
do you remember the real life physical campaigns trying to get people to stop saying it in like school environments
that happened when _i_ was in high school
i would argue that it's actually way less mainstream now
hm
sorry, i thought you were talking about the efforts to get rid of it
relatedly, you know what else used to be slurs tay?
insane, imbecile, moron, dolt, idiot
all of those were viewed as similar or worse pejoratives as "retard" is by various people today
dumb and idiot were both used as insults mere decades ago
being called dumb back in the 60s and 70s would get you beat up
calling someone*
yeah, well those people are stupid
<:TenseiFace:243174946178596864>
in seriousness, i don't really know what the logical conclusion of that mindset is
just completely getting rid of every possible insulting adjective?
these things are temporary changes that eventually become irrelevant, and they don't actually accomplish all that much in the meantime to begin with
i still go along with it because that's what people ask, but on a personal level i have to express some doubts about how much is actually being done
yeah essentially qweq
"retard" is not even in the same league as something like the n word, whose use is universally understood and only the most overt racists will challenge you over
also as evidenced by the fact that i feel okay using one over the other
something like "the r slur" is far more nebulous in its meaning and intention that people are going to fight you based on their own personal usage
obviously, citing lat's example, a parent calling you that because you have ADHD is fucking terrible
but i'm more familiar with the use where it's like between friends, as a light insult when you do something stupid
and so i get vaguely miffed about it
i've heard the more generalized argument against it enough times that i just don't bother most of the time anymore though
oh shit, hope you're having fun despite getting shit rolls
unfortunately that's how almost every low level D&D game goes
it has to do with the modifiers and how many dice you're working with
i heard you like wolves...
guys look at this tweet i found just now
i was at home
DM doing tabletop
i get called over
"what are we playing today"
friend says "DM is dead"
then who was at table?
alright, done with dinner, maybe now i can start on the collection
maybe this'll rekindle my love for the franchise
yeah, that's only shortly before "actual dinner time" here
americans eat between 5-7, typically 6 PM is what i'm used to
that's called an emulator, dunkass
uh
i can't even tell if this is supposed to be real or not
terrible
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
what is it, foul one
bwee
holy fucking shit, is that real??
oh shit
beyond just rereading homestuck with this i'm also trying to go through other content too
like, it's been forever since i read through whistles
i completely forgot that there's also a tiny robot that rips its way out of a doll in this story
HUSSIE IS A HACK, AS USUAL, PLAGIARIZING HIS OWN WORKS
in seriousness, i was hoping i'd witness some deep cuts like this
no
i'm going to try and go roughly chronologically
~~i don't actually know when his earlier stuff came out~~
but i'll be going through the team special olympics stuff, then each of the mspaintadventures in sequential order
i don't think being self-referential is a post-modernist feature
callbacks are as old as storytelling itself
okay, i was feeling kind of indignant with tm bringing up the meta aspects of the story cuz i don't feel like allusions towards other works the author has done counts as post-modernist
so i looked up "meta storytelling" and found this
https://iep.utm.edu/lyotard/#SH4b
this has little to do with "meta" as we understand it, and as far as i can tell is a way more generalized analytical look at what metanarratives are and how to define them
```Lyotard famously defines the postmodern as ‚Äòincredulity towards metanarratives,‚Äô where metanarratives are understood as totalising stories about history and the goals of the human race that ground and legitimise knowledges and cultural practises... Modernity is defined as the age of metanarrative legitimation, and postmodernity as the age in which metanarratives have become bankrupt. Through his theory of the end of metanarratives, Lyotard develops his own version of what tends to be a consensus among theorists of the postmodern ‚Äì postmodernity as an age of fragmentation and pluralism.```
what i get out of this is that modernity is saying "our cultural norms have value and are substantially based in reality" while post-modernity suggests that this is actually false, and our cultural norms have no real worth
this feels at odds with previous conversations we've had about notions of art or meaning in art, though
we've discussed the fact that what is "good" in art or what "good art" is depends on the individual
but we were able to come to a consensus that different schools of art or thought operate along certain axioms of quality that can be adhered to
i think we need to move past post-modernism and approach some kind of middleground where we can observe that different people value different things, but the fact that stuff is subjective doesn't mean standards can't exist
it's like a mutual understanding between people who happen to like similar shit
the splintering of art based on individual interpretation is making it hard for the average person to care or get involved
or, well
one might say it makes it _easier_ for the average person to get involved
but what i mean is that it makes it harder to discuss this shit in any sort of practical terms
it's that prager university meme about "standards in art" but i tried to phrase it in a less bullshit way
<@!186774984092418048> yeah kind of
i'm not phrasing it very well
and don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that we need to try and objectify art writ large
like, i think we've all agreed collectively that that's pretty much impossible
but this is what i mean when i say axioms of quality
where within a certain "type" of art, you should be able to say "this is a pillar of what it means to be good using this specific style"
"if you make something sufficiently different that is still able to be considered good, what you're doing is creating a new school of thought or a new type of art"
and thus new axioms of quality are born, which certain people may accept or reject
i basically agree with the part you quoted, in the sense that i feel post-modernism muddles things and makes it harder to like... get shit done
it's good to be able to discuss things in abstract ways, but too much of that becomes hand-wringing and prevents any real work from being done
philosophizing overly much can get in the way of actually taking steps
there has to be a decent striking point where you're able to say "okay, we don't have a perfect understanding of what's going on but we need to actually start doing shit"
yeah but we're not talking about hateboners, we're talking about being able to say "there are no objective truths but reducing everything to subjectivity is causing problems"
you certainly don't think that certain philosophies are as worthwhile as others
ie fascism over liberty
<@!146014279529791488> sorry we homestuck chat, not archaeology nerds
i'm telling you, you guys should contact an expert at the state college
it's an okay name
calls to mind joan of arc, a good namesake for john
fem!drew's name is you're a fucking wiener
oh man, it's today!
i'm glad the reception to the project has been positive so far
i'm worried that something might crop up, but each day we go where that doesn't happen, the less the chances are
gonna keep hoping that people view it positively
hell, i hope viz takes note and tries to work with you in a way that's totally constructive
or maybe not, you deserve your rest
wait is worm like some kind of important person
lame
read worm jokes are so 2017
<:monkaOMEGA:663106010344587279>
ACUPUNCTURE?
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
have a special achievement for it
piss everyone off
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
of all the messages to get pulled
wow, i thought more people were present for that conversation
it's an anecdote i've provided more than once
tori btfo
in all i'm greatly exposing the exposure to gundam stuff
appreciating
not exposing
sorry, i'm tired
i don't have my thoguhts assembled yet, i need to ruminate on them
i'm pretty sure a VPN works based on dedicated host IPs, doesn't it??
HOLY SHIT GUYS
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228> THE ARCHIVE <:fatHusky:295293991438516228> THE BETA <:fatHusky:295293991438516228> HIVESWAP ACT 2 <:fatHusky:295293991438516228> SLUR REPLACEMENT PROJECT <:fatHusky:295293991438516228> SLUR ENHANCEMENT PROJECT <:fatHusky:295293991438516228> FATHUSKY <:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
it's weird seeing you pessimistic qweq, you always try so hard to be a positive force in here
except for specific things i guess
also you're a furry, so that's points against you
no swish it's just a joke to people being vaguely divided/apathetic about the slur removal project
we were talking about it earlier today like
some people see the point, others don't, but no one is particularly up in arms about it
then someone came in, i think it was jamie, all like
"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST GUYS"
"WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS"
"JUST LET THEM REMOVE THE GOD DAMN SLURS"
disclaimer, jamie wasn't actually like that
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
the discussion surrounding the slur replacement project and literally all tangential arguments has been extremely civil and exploratory
there is absolutely no reason for people to be upset
just relax
what, a la the godfather??
who is putting severed asses in people's beds
is there an ass mafia
side note but crayon, regardless of whether it was on purpose, i am _definitely_ going to find a definition and usage for the word "alconolage"
like drunken acknowledgement
anyway
i have been TRYING to read the archive all day but chat has been popping and then i was watching giant robots
yeah i could stand to expand my repetoire
repertoire*
how are you feeling bam
i bet it's been a very exciting 24 hours
<@!137125582994538496> any attention is nervewracking, but i'm happy that it's been well-received
i hope that the other shoe DOESN'T drop, and i think no one would blame you if you just failed to persist on the radar
fading into obscurity isn't undesirable
yeah, basically
woc has a point bambosh
you'd have to withstand like a year of people sending you death threats, but then you'd be completely out of the public eye
i'm very unconcerned with the concept, call me male or neutral pronouns
or whatever really
i don't give a shit
as long as you call me a fatass we're all good
i'm joking
aspen we try to keep things at least vaguely chill here
it's all good
bambosh is my ectofather??
it's not that i don't believe you, it's that i'm trying to be charitable and also joke around with you, you stupid shrine maiden wiener
now SHUT IT
it's okay bam, no one expects you to say stuff
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
true
how did that journalist thing pan out
i can't believe bambosh is going in nature magazine as the world's holotype of a chad
i mean, in terms of archival, you're not really wrong
bam's efforts were way more intensive and worthwhile than SPAT
STOP MAKING THIS ABOUT ME AND MY STUFF
BAM'S PROJECT IS GREAT TALK ABOUT HIM
i already wrote notes about bam's project
i need to get around to writing it out
bam cut his hands on those artifacts so many god damn times
the work of a master
yeah that's the thing that blows my mind tay
homestuck is like... basically saved, not even an exaggeration
it's been protected against the tides of time, the disintegration of the internet notwithstanding
YEAH
i'm fucking astounded at just how much stuff there is
and the functionality on top of it
ancient personal lore
it's an image i saw in my dream once of a willow tree, drew it in mspaint, then someone here cleaned it up about three years ago
it's been my online avatar for like a decade
nat is like a vicious dog, she just gets angrier the more you try to mollify her
quick, pour some soda into her nostrils
well, this sounds like a problem for later bam
your work is done
let the torch pass on to the next great archivist
oh shit, i didn't know that solar
nat is going to start stabbing you aspen
my question exactly
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
fucking hell
thanks global warming, you ruin everything and _will keep_ ruining everything
nat is sleep deprived and not used to people being nice to her
i'm terminating this discussion
nat go to sleep, aspen let her be
i was enjoying the fucking archive discussion and it turned into a farce
oh wow, that is definitely pretty fringe solar
i love it
i can actually kind of see how it would work, too
find out how to take a fluorescent protein that reacts to the presence of radiation, of which there are many, and anchor it to the same genes that are responsible for the production of fur
wouldn't even need to be all of the fur, just a key spot or two
YOU'RE A LIAAAARRRRRRRRRR
GET OUT OF MY GOD DAMN SCUBA GEAR YOU IMEBCILE
have you ever heard the phrase lurk more
wow
wow, i have no idea how to approach this conversation
fucking hell, i haven't heard the phrase "thanos car" in a hot minute
alright i guess it's my job as the resident diplomat and people lover to explain
aspen when we say lurk more it means that you're thoroughly unaware of the channel culture and you're dragging down conversation by not engaging with it properly
you gotta make at least a cursory effort to become familiar with what's going on, otherwise it becomes awkward and stymies conversation
sometimes i get tired of being nice but mostly i just want to encourage more people to talk here
aspen's not doing anything wrong either, they're just being weird
that's perfectly fine for someone who doesn't know what the fuck this place is
anyway READ SPAT
you gonna seal it in crystal as a covenant of friendship between the dwarves and elves? you gonna cry?
what the fuck is the matter with you
okay, fuck you kosh
that actually made me snort so hard a booger came out
don't tell me to pick my nose tay, it's U N B E C O M I N G
STOP
I'M NOT ENTERTAINING THIS DISCUSSION
NEXT MENTION OF SEXUAL FLUIDS GETS A ZA WARUDO
<@!168980988477702145> it's probably someone's friend or something using the same account who cares
i'm not interested enough in this mystery to pry
just ove on
what in the fuck is HAPPENING tonight
the chat took a hard left from bam's archive into the fucking trash bin of confusion
alright, well
yeah, i must have pissed him off at some point
is ignoreplebs even on
alright that's it
nah it just takes a bit
to show up
ban already went through, woc has yelled at us enough times
oh man that was the family spaghetti conversation
i don't think so?
it did not, but i wrote about it in spat
it was worthy of that at least
i almost did throw up from laughing at that discussion
<@!207991389613457408> when was the last time you had the family spaghetti
misha isn't the only resident anime expert
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
what the actual fuck
i can't remember if i've ever read a steep price for pie before
this archive is awakening me to new old experiences
uh, excuse me
guess i'll see it when i get to it
fucking quaking in my boots here
jesus fucking christ having this in a browser format is godlike
i'm opening new tabs like it's fucking christmas
it's kind of weird, but looking at all of the really old art of his that has effort put into it, it makes me think of calvin and hobbes in some respects
i was more referring to the visual elements
specifically anything that feels watercolorish
dark humor is just trying to get some enjoyment out of the more depressing or sordid parts of life
it's basically "well, this shit sucks, but i might as well try to have a good time despite it"
gallows humor is a subset of dark humor
not all dark humor is gallows humor but all gallows humor is dark humor
humanimals is still great
i nominate that we make this guy our new server icon
i don't know if it counts as either but somehow i don't fucking remember reading zoosmells either
all of these are catching me off guard
i think zoosmells would categorize into shock humor actually
because its punchlines are all about just being as ridiculous as possible
what the ACTUAL FUCK is this jigsaw thread
i have NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THIS
<@!137125582994538496> DUDE
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i'm fucking losing it
what exactly does it take to be a hoarding specialist
just sifting through all the crap and keeping stuff that's worthwhile?
fuck, i should have charged my grandparents for cleaning out their shitty gross ass storage room
that took me like three days
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
what the fuck
yeah, that's been the entire point lat
"extremely doable"
who the fuck do you think most of us are
at this point i don't even believe i'm going to make that much money across the entire span of my _life_
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
just a bit
i experience that a little on like a weekly basis
every time i drive through another tiny town in missouri i've never been to with like 36 people
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
we couldn't have a commune
we could have a loose neighborhood at most
have fun jorts
i think sky just needs to fucking settle down, i wish she didn't feel the need to push the envelope on stuff
especially on horny shit
i'd let her back in if she were actually able to just not talk about that kind of thing anymore
beyond more socially appropriate discussions
i don't think it's that hard to comprehend that we don't want super explicit discussions or "tips" for people in a server filled to the brim with people under the age of majority
yeah, but
gnawms is still here
so clearly delivering an ultimatum has at least kind of worked
it's not really the furryposting
it was the associated implication of horny
i don't actually feel like explaining it
i could try, but i have a feeling our working definition/standards for this would just get semantically discussed to death
and i don't think i really need to justify when i feel like getting rid of posts that appear horny
the point is that some stuff is over the line and other stuff isn't, and if people want to be mad at us for being imperfect operators then suck my human brain juice
i'm reading the archive leave me alone
cold turkey means "quit completely with no tapering off"
it's often used in reference to drugs and alcohol
"i know what will needs. we need to attack him"
W-WH WHY A-ARE YELL-YELL MEEEEEEEEEEE?
I WAS MINDIN' MY ***DAMN*** BUSINESS EATIN' SOME ***DAMN*** FRUIT
i mean
what exactly is happening canis
are you just not getting around to your assignments
i think that being able to stay on top of your workload is a skill you have to develop
i'm not sure how that problem starts
but universities are pretty forgiving because this kind of thing happens a lot
you'll probably be put on probation but you can also ask for resources to help improve your study habits
i don't mean they'll just wipe your slate clean
obviously you can't be doing that shit too much or too often
but one fucked up semester is usually okay
well you sound like you went to a shit unviersity so neener
hopefully things work out canis
i'll be rooting for you
i'm okay with venting as long as it doesn't get too deep or personal
like, i don't want to spill my guts but more superficial stuff is okay
everyone has shitty days
well, he made that simple enough
thanks for the ping, foul raider
well, there's nothing to say we can't try to get back into it
tabletop simulator
i bought a bunch of copies for people in here and we ended up playing some stuff a few times, like poker
it was actually quite fun
interesting didn't keep up though, not least of which cuz i'm too tired to keep it going
what is it seymour
lmao, okay
i've read that before and i had no idea it was just an edit from a bronie thing
bronie? brony
whatever
that version is WAY WAY more believable
imagine throwing an anal vore party <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
horrified?
the illuminati were like "we went too far with this one guys" and are trying to cover it up
pass it off as a joke
see yo
i'm gonna read up to john playing piano and call it a night myself, i have work tomorrow
üêÄ
man, i'm just on page 43 and there's already been some pretty good humor in homestuck
```John: Captchalogue GameBro.

It might come in handy if you ever need something that burns easily.```
such a simple throwaway line
and yet it spices things up just right
a specific flavor of scathing
right?
there's just nothing like this in hs2 so far
i guess the question that might be asked is whether hs2 should even _strive_ to have stuff like this in it, or if it was better off trying to be something unique
no, stop
i was arguing in the hypothetical
oh you're talking about something different
silence, thot
for all our complaints about homestuck 2 not being good so far, we also complain a lot about stuff that doesn't try to do anything new
oh right, i wanted to ask
bam was there a fix for aliasing issues
i thought i saw something earlier
nah, image
images appearing slightly crustier than they should
the colors on the sassacre book popping out weirdly for instance
sure one sec
original on top, archive on bottom

just appears to be the way the aliasing affects the image
zoomed out you can't even tell
well, mostly
change my settings like in the archive or for my display
wew lad
makes sense
it's not that bad thankfully, easy enough to keep going
you'd think trump's first term would have put a nail in it but i guess they decided to hedge their bets again
thankfully it seems people are fucking tired of trump enough that they're overlooking biden's deficiencies for now
the memory of the people is short enough that this person is likely correct though, republicans will swing back in unless democrats really manage to appeal to the populace
it's hard when you're working with a group of people brainwashed into believing stuff that literally isn't real
the extent of deprogramming that would need to happen to get the average american citizen to not be a complete moron is unimaginable
tm, are you referring to us talking about deprogramming people
because there is a legitimate difference between brainwashing and deprogramming
like, that rhetoric of "how do you deprogram without reprogramming the other direction" is just tiresome
i don't know how else to describe that certain things are factually correct and other things are not
no i know i was just referencing it
i don't know tay, i really don't
i don't think i have an answer besides "you need to be able to use empiricism to get rid of blatantly false information"
obviously empiricism can be misused but it's at least better than bald-faced lies
sciencing away politics isn't about using science to understand _politics_
or at least, that's not what i was talking about
i was more trying to say that we need to reinforce the idea that science is trustworthy and people shouldn't just ignore it because that's what they want to do
part of the problem we're facing is that, despite literally _everything_ in modern society being predicated on the advancements of science and technology, certain hot topic issues can be turned into enormous wedge controversies
in ways that are completely contradictory to institutional understanding
contest election results, but otherwise not much would be available to them
i guess it depends on the extent of their failure
if it's just the presidency that's one thing
but if they lose congress again too, that would be crushing beyond belief
thankfully, it doesn't seem likely they'll lose congress
they're favored to win the senate and they're VERY favored to keep the house
putting aside the more doom-oriented prognoses, what happens if somehow the democrats win a significant portion of the house, the senate, AND the presidency? do you think that momentum will carry on into midterms or will people have forgotten how fucking awful trump has been and we have a repeat of obama's first term?
i don't think it's _that_ off base tarty, there was literally a plot to kidnap and murder the governor of michigan that got foiled by the FBI
we may not be at weekly car bombings yet but i wouldn't be surprised if things intensify badly
not possible, unless he manages to convince the secret service to secede in his favor
and the military
but the secret service and military both kind of fucking hate his guts
we don't need gun shipments from iran tarty, there's already more guns than people here
fair enough
i will fully admit to being ignorant about the scale of the troubles
except i'd like to point out that foreign interest is definitely a factor here already in the form of meddling from russia, china, iran, etc
uh huh sure
PLAGUE CHILDS ROAM FREE
imagine if this was a lying child

they would not like it
okay so ricesnot's halloween video this year was pretty okay, it made me laugh a couple times
i don't think he is ever going to surpass the tokyo drift one though
this is truly a pinnacle of vidsmithing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H43gzJU2NxI
real time sentences where you can see him go back and edit out typos will never get old
also this video is good for sure, but these are the mysteries is a golden series

hamborglars at the golden tits of america haven't been a dollar for years
they specifically call it the value menu to avoid being called out that it's not that cheap anymore
did she say two jobs? we meant three jobs
minimum wage jobs aren't like they used to be
you remember when they were supposed to pay a real, living wage for an entire family and now you need two or three jobs just to afford rent
that doesn't seem right does it
people are already doing that more tarty
over 50% of the US lives with their parents
even more than during the great depression
such is the """housing crisis"
ie the crisis that could be totally undercut by just lowering the cost of land and housing
where there's something like tens of thousands of empty houses not even being used
get ye bed rest
i remember reading like a year or two ago about how wealth disparity in america was the worst it's ever been and i remember thinking "huh, i wonder what that'll be like as time goes by"
turns out the answer is "depressing"

i didn't know that moon, i should probably get one of those dog tags
why
that's literally what that is
are you stupid
thanks guys
we're home now, taking the rest of the day easy
i gotta figure stuff out
including finding a new job
student loans are coming up due next month and i have basically no way to take care of them so i've got that on top of everything
just gonna crawl in bed for the day
no, just a six month grace period once you graduate
took a fat fucking nap for like four hours
still feel like shit
have a picture of my giant sequoia seedling
i haven't been drinking at all and i probably won't, i don't want to use alcohol as a coping method for mourning
i'm just gonna cook a steak and crawl back in bed

the tiny trunk is covered with soil, i got paranoid after the cat fucked up the plant before
it snowed yesterday and a little bit today, very chilly at 30F and overcast
i like the cold
this is TOO cold for these seedlings though, i took them inside weeks ago
anything below like 42F is overwhelming for young sequoias
i take umbrage with that post
you can't just make up random crazy bullshit, you also have to be able to tie it in to what you've got effectively enough
people try to come up with wackyzany plots all the time and fail, it takes a kind of finesse
you got something to say lat
probably
so i'm currently drowning my sorrows in vinesauce
it's a good decision
oh and also cosmic brownies
get your dirt fatty comments out right now we're gonna be here for a while

also wait a second what
what the fuck is this about hussie
wait, is this related to uh
some post i didn't actually get to see where he had clown paint on
uh
just more evidence in the "we did the right thing" pile

i want some beef brisket and burnt ends
bear in mind that i am a bread and meat guy
i don't like a lot of fixings
i just want the shell and the meat
and rice
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MAKE YOUR TACOS OUT OF
WHAT IS IT CALLED
TELL ME
I WANT TO KNOW
you mean like corn tortillas?
yeah of course
i love authentic tortillas
flour is also good, different flavor

how dare you speak to me that way
it's not hard
you should see how many messages most of us have
that depends on what the history is like, but a more salient question is why you're questioning this when you've sent so little
seriously, average post count in here ranges from tens of thousands to a few _hundred_ thousand
you gotta get those numbers up, those are rookie numbers
how do you think i feel, homer
wow
i didn't think it would be that pronounced but including <#310692219348713472> pushes you over 250,000

apparently earth C is post-scarcity due to alchemy
but where does all the grist come from
also why are you staying home saffron
stay safe cy
<@!191265659936702464> yeah i already played a bit of it last night
i'm torn between wanting to do a deep dive on it immediately or wait until i'm ready to go whole hog on sekiro again
i already beat one of the revamped boss fights
||inner genichiro is _fucking nuts_||
yep
there's three "gauntlets" that have different bosses you can fight in a row (completing all three unlocks a fourth gauntlet which is just All of the Bosses)
i just started a DS1 run with dero though
so like
i kind of don't want to split my focus
i tried going from ds1 to sekiro and it fucked me up so bad
makin you're just bad at sekiro
admit it
none of th bosses have been changed, there are just three bosses who have new, "inner" forms with different movesets
also the mini-bosses do not feature in the gauntlets
it's only Actual Bosses
got it in one
but father, not owl
anyway, my problem is that my xbox controller fucking bit the dust months ago and i was able to sort of jury rig a nintendo switch pro controller to work instead
there's a little jank on sekiro but on dark souls 1 it's absolutely fucked
the menu button and the target enemy buttons have switched places
the A B X Y buttons have all switched places
the gesture button is L3
i can't handle it
it kills me every single time
i'm okay with this
what does nevernude even mean
i can think of a few meanings based on context clues
there's a lot i haven't watched

i'm sure he's worried about the election

i think that if i started a watch through on my own i might be able to get through it now
i enjoyed some of the episodes i saw in isolation
but trying to start it from the beginning when we did it that one other time didn't do it for me
i'll give arrested development a proper try if i we do watch it
spin off show yeah
i liked the few episodes i saw of it, did it fall off in quality or did it finish strong
weird, i definitely thought it was done by now
neither can most people, i would surmise
but i'm biased here because i despise the cycle of words that makes things that were innocuous become unacceptabe
i also don't really mind that there's a group of people who want to replace the slurs in homestuck? it's easy enough to do and it doesn't like... delete the original
as long as they recognize that the original does in fact have those slurs in them, then let them do what they want
i car
if that's the logic trip then yeah i totally disagree with them
that the original work should be abridged to suit modern tastes? hopefully not many
i think we have deliberated on stuff like this a lot in here
i'm trying to figure out a way to word it succinctly
it's like, the desire to change something to suit you more and then _flatly deny_ that it was ever different
it's one thing to make a version that's different because you think it works better, but to claim the original doesn't exist or is invalid as a result? like, damn
might as well burn the book at that point
are you being unironic or
uh
qweq i think the consensus is that the physical product is fine, but the reasoning behind it kind of sucks
wanting to make a unique version of a product tailored to you = perfectly fine
using that unique version as casus belli to say the original work doesn't deserve to exist anymore = not okay
what do you mean
<:jerry:568521849714245665>
wow qweq
you wanna slap anymore of that giant morality boner out on the table
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i admire your optimism
that's interesting
i wonder exactly how many versions of bam's archive will exist before all is said and done

if a resurrected adolf hitler literally entered this server i have no idea what i would do
look, if the literal resurrection of adolf hitler walked into your living room, would you seriously immediately get the knives out and stab him to death or would you try to figure out how he's possibly standing there
arguably yes
yeah, what are you talking about
makin was not the one who started this derailment
i was just curious about the hypothetical
yeah probably
it's clearly a joke
or at least indulging in a hypothetical that is so fucking ridiculous it'll never actually happe
the implication is we develop space travel dero
imagine being able to say you punched hitler
if it was hitler yes
godwin's law is extremely powerful
i can try and actually make it to the texas meetup if it ever does happen, i'm much closer than i was before
actually it kind of depends on where in texas
if it's further south i probably won't make it
what was the nintendo news
wow, zento going straight for the jugular
no alright zent, you've clarified enough that i'm going to deny your position
you're suggesting that the true nature of "awful" is not ascertained here and it's just about what people perceive
i'm pretty sure dero, and how i feel, is that there is a real level of "awful" in as close to an objective sense as can possibly be ascertained by humans
and that this discord group is not really all that Awful
something something the nature of truth something, you're a wiener

just thinking about doing research again makes me want to cut my family jewels off
what a horrific rat race
HAH
yeah that's not surprising
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
what did him in, besides literally everything
sounds like stolen or fabricated research
i mean, that's also really bad but usually a gag order involves something bad on a higher level too
hard to say
i just remember reading a lot of ethical case files in one of our training classes
reports of students turning in their PIs for stealing research from other labs or fabricating results
well thank goodness for that at least <:TenseiFace:243174946178596864>
it's okay moon
you're in the same position i was, mostly
it's a daunting mountain to climb, but honestly? right now this is probably one of the better positions to be in
finding a job elsewhere is fucking hard, and i already _have_ my master's degree
stay where you are and weather the storm, and hopefully by the time you graduate things will be in a better spot for you to get a good career when you're out
i know it's not fun advice but that's how it is
yep, i did that in my biochem class
it was one of those "what the fuck am i doing" moments
oh
that's pretty evil;
what a coincidence, i have soda for you too
grape juice is fairly common for consecrated materials in presbyterian services
source: raised presbyterian
we also used pie crust for the body
i would take two wafers because i liked how it tasted and i was a fat fuck
presbyterians are more slightly more chill christians
are they flies or maggots
speak straight, wench
bambosh is too nice to take that position makin
you're the only one with the lack of humility sufficient to say "you should be fucking grateful for all the effort i put into x projects, i am literally saving your ass"
the actual truthiness of that statement is irrelevant, it's a matter of social tact
bambosh is a nice guy
like an actual nice guy, not a scummy neckbeard
so even if he makes viz 1 billion dollars he'll probably say some shit like "oh uh it's not a big deal i'm just glad i was able to help out and generate some interest in the property again"

i still haven't found a good enough idle game in the last month or two
i did play a dark room and that was pretty cool
<:pog:576614562598748213>
happy borth
if you have a game you want i will get it for you on the provision that it is 15 bucks or less
yes
that's called anxiety
or more generally malaise
it isn't so bad if it's once in a while, but waking up with it every day is crippling
i hope it goes away

if i have to make a topical recommendation, i think you should play deus ex for the memes
it's old but fun

well, let me know what you decide
no pressure, i'll be here
he has a point, the shooting is extremely bad
although that sniper rifle was pretty sweet
most of the time i used stealth and sord
<:gachiGASM:353818316046991361>
the sniper rifle is literally the only worthwhiel gun unless you train all of them sufficiently
the 10mm pistol is a fucking joke
the sawed off shotgun is pretty lulzy, it's more accurate than a pistol and has more range too
assault rifle is zzz
rocket launchers are great in certain circumstances, i usually used them to clean out robots but i also used it against a large group of enemies and it instagibbed literally all of them
gave me a solid laugh
first
well it's based on "giblets"
ooh, nice sale
also yes
that's the point andrew
so "instagib" would be "instajib"
the real lesson here is that english is fucking rarted
lmao
that's something dero and i talked about today while we were hanging out
there's a local italian restaurant and the owners are like _very clearly_ stereotypical italians
the original owner is clearly a first or second generation immigrant with the heavy accent, kind of looks like tito dick dickman
there was a picture of a dinner item called the "SUPER NANO"
dero asked how much it costs and tony said "40 dolla"
then he chuckled and said "it weighs five and a half pounds," i literally couldn't stop myself from laughing at that for some reason
i have no clue, it looked like three different sub sandwiches packaged together
like a meatball marinara and two others
<@!146014279529791488> that food was fucking good
apparently the regular nano costs 10 dollars
either way, the point is the food is great
we'll be eating at tony's a lot more often in the future
it's kind of bizarre just how much he looks like tito dick even though tito is from the philippines and not italy
depends on what the pearl jam is
that sounds pretty good
funk is pretty great when they chat
bam i'm just tickled pink that the archive is getting so much attention
it feels like an incredible spurt of energy in the fandom
shut up
shut the fuck up
NO
i'll give you access to me for like 10 bucks and a chicken sandwich
i can't exactly afford to be picky right now
spicy food? even better
what is it with you and paninis
paninis look pretty good sometimes
can it be any kind of meat? i usually see it as salami or ham
roast beef panini sounds pretty good
or chicken
excellent
when are we marathoning seinfeld
gundam is a weird show
i watched the movie versions by myself a while ago and was thoroughly unimpressed with it the entire way through, UNTIL the very end
and then there was a sequence of dialogue between two main characters that utterly transformed the entire show for me
i don't even know why it affected me so much, but it was like "holy fucking shit, all of a sudden i understand everything"
it wasn't even char, it was what's her tits
i don't think it was sayla either, it was some other newtype
she communicated with amuro telepathically
yeah that one
she spoke to amuro about the development of humans in space and how they were ushering in a new stage of evolution
something like that
yeah
again, i'm not sure why that dialogue impacted me so much
it was just incredibly visceral
tm you haven't even seen the thing in question
get fucked
yeah i think it was just
the intense chaos of what was going on at the end of 0079
like, it was just a complete den of noise and confusion for everyone involved in that fight
and in the middle of it all you have these specimens that are trying to not only survive, but to also figure out their spot in the larger universe
something about that struck me really hard
sad! but agreed
i heard you the first time
i'll get to it tomorrow, i'm going to bed
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
NO
YES (Will abandon previous covenant)
this sounds like something an edgy 13 year old would write after toking up
yeah, they're not that bad
unless you drink something at like a snail's pace
and they get all soggy
i would
it sounds fun, fuck the haters
i want to start calling people smoothbrains but it's uncharacteristically rude for me, i'm just gonna play games instead
oh yeah that's a thing right now
let me get on
i'm getting on tf2 right now
god, i have not played this game at all
i already did nights
you are a wiener
mfw makin forgot to say the password is "crosbytop" in the announcement
yeah my bad
we've got 6 people in the tf2 server, ping more people so they join in
8 people <a:pogChimp:600861153710833683>
this pretty much sums up my team fortress 2 experience

YOU _FAILED_
fuck you i do what i want
i'm having a blast
yeah i have to go run errands
that was a solid two hours
yeah
i hope we play again soon
maybe tonight sometime, who knows
sprays for days
good job makin
you fuck
like i said i need to grab stuff tho
it was realy fun, we'll have to do more another time
<:foooooooooool:292673270199746561>
why the fuck would i randomly turn around
i thought that i do that regularly enough anyway
no m ypoint is
i always try to look around just to keep my eye on things generally
so
you telling me to do this is pointless
<@!125433170047795200> i have no alcohol with me
what's the moscow mule again
right
hm
<@!125433170047795200> i am leaving to acquire these ingredients and i will be back shortly
<@125433170047795200> turns out the store has NO ginger beer to speak of, is ginger ale acceptable
<@125433170047795200> it's not bad
Very fizzy with the ale
i don't think i like this quite as much as the kamikaze but it's definitely something i would order at a bar
pack it up, it's time to go home
perfect though
sup gremlin
how long have you gone without sleep
at nat
also it's been a slow evening since tf2
no worries
we will come back to life like a phoenix huffing its own ashes
no, i was going to start on that with the reread
i shall start now then
you needy pricks
not unless a shit ton of people suddenly get interested
i'm reading karkat goes to a convention now christ
is his server even still up
ugh
do i feel like pinging all these people
also no probably not
i'm reading kgtac
flgs?
let's say no nost
it's honestly a bit late for americans now, it's like 11 PM on the east coast
ugh fine you whiners
<@&767403690055172114> last call for TF2 for the evening, get in before the server is taken down maybe for good
check announcements if you can't remember how to get in
also makin said interest has already gone down too much
check announcements
pushing game servers isn't my job
we need to get a whip
holy fucking christ
CHECK ANNOUNCEMENTS
sorry, it's just i've been asked that like 4 times in five minutes
i even said up by the ping to check announcements for details
ree ree, etc
i'm not sure, it's makin's deal
either way, get it while it's hot
really good shit so far, that's basically all i have to say about it
can't wait for more spice
and the comeuppance of badgurl413
indeed
i'll try to keep my eye open for proper ginger beer
what's _that_ one
what an awful week
hopefully the next will be better
i've given up trying to understand
so why HASN'T india seen a lot of deaths from vodi
there are a lot of areas in india that don't have the best infrastructure or education
holy shit, does sealand consider the people who purchase titles from them their ambassadors
can we go back to sealand for a second
i fucking love sealand, unironically
i've wanted to purchase a title from sealand for a while just for the novelty of it
and occasionally take a physical trip there
eventually rather
it'd be such a dumb conversational piece
"oh, and i happen to be a lord in the principality of sealand"
it's just such a quaint piece of international politics
SWIMM
you can be a lord/lady, a count/countess, a knight/lady, or a duke/duchess
duke/duchess are the most expensive at about $650, count/countess are about $300, knight/dame at $125, and lord/lady at $50
you can't be a princess of sealand because there's only one princess of sealand, and her name is joan
educate yourself you TRASH https://sealandgov.org/about/
i guess, but joan is already married to prince michael
no but in seriousness sealand is fucking hilarious
i have no idea how it still exists
oh
apparently princess joan died back in 2016
and she was actually married to the founder roy bates, and the prince michael was their _son_
guys
i have a crazy idea
the HSD should occupy sealand
```In August 1978, Alexander Achenbach, who describes himself as the Prime Minister of Sealand, hired several German and Dutch mercenaries to lead an attack on Sealand while Bates and his wife were in England.[8] Achenbach had disagreed with Bates over plans to turn Sealand into a luxury hotel and casino with fellow German and Dutch businessmen.[19] They stormed the platform with speedboats, Jet Skis and helicopters, and took Bates's son Michael hostage. Michael was able to retake Sealand and capture Achenbach and the mercenaries using weapons stashed on the platform. Achenbach, a German lawyer who held a Sealand passport, was charged with treason against Sealand[8] and was held unless he paid DM 75,000 (more than US$35,000 or ¬£23,000).[20] Germany then sent a diplomat from its London embassy to Sealand to negotiate for Achenbach's release. Roy Bates relented after several weeks of negotiations and subsequently claimed that the diplomat's visit constituted de facto recognition of Sealand by Germany.[8]```
yeah, and apparently it's like... actual """battles"""
with threats upon life
UK expanded its waters to 12 nautical miles offshore and steadfastly refuses to recognize sealand's sovereignty or even validity
apparently a true nation state would need to dwell on a natural land feature like an island, and because it's artificial it has no bearing as a place of residence
```At a micronations conference hosted by the University of Sunderland in 2004, Sealand was represented by Michael Bates's son James. The facility is now occupied by one or more caretakers representing Michael Bates, who himself resides in Essex, England.[34]```
```Bir Tawil's climate is, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification, a very hot desert climate (Bwh). During the summer months, approximately three-quarters of the year, temperatures can exceed 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F), while its hottest three months (June‚ÄìAugust) can see it as high as 45 ¬∞C (113 ¬∞F). During the brief winters, however (December and January being its mildest months), Bir Tawil can experience milder temperatures with 26 ¬∞C (79 ¬∞F) as its usual temperature peak. ```
bear with me here, i'm imagining a scenario
solar energy harvesting on the surface, with underground settlements
oh, if only we were rich and had the startup cash for it!
underground settlements with solar energy harvesting on top, use it as data storage
PERFECT

genuinely settling a part of the moon would be an impressive feat
i don't think people would try to fuck with you too badly if you actually pulled it off
the spacenoid uprising begins
more space
i think it'll happen
the exact time it'll happen is the biggest thing in dispute
some people think it'll happen in 10-20 years, some people think it'll happen next century, some people thnk it'll happen next millennia
look, the space shuttle was honestly a rarted idea
are we in the first or second cycle
i wonder what exactly was the height of technology for bronze age civilizations
like, what was the most "advanced" thing they ever conceived
too bad we'll never know this
i'm still amazed that there's enough people in here where these nuances can be discussed in any level of detail, i never really thought before about the difference in advances of armor between the west and the east
i was going to say
the persian tactics worked due to an extreme abundance of cheap, poorly equipped conscripts basically
if you remove the size of the empire from the equation it doesn't shack up at all
but i guess that's the point of the discussion, is that the circumstances of an individual polity will affect exactly how its tactics shape up
```Cyrus, convinced that Croesus was a  good man and a favourite of heaven, asked him after he was taken off the pile, "Who it was that had persuaded him to lead an army into his country, and so become his foe rather than  continue his friend?"  to which Croesus made answer as follows: "What I did, oh! king, was to thy advantage and to  my  own  loss.  If there be blame, it rests with the god of the Greeks, who encouraged me to begin the war. No one is so foolish as to prefer  war to peace, in  which, instead of sons  burying their fathers, fathers bury their sons. But the gods willed it so."```
that's good

i actually have a "set" of chopsticks that i have in a nice little box
it's two sets of wooden chopsticks that are nicely decorated
i bought them for like four bucks, but i use them all the time
very worthwhile purchase
what? fuck you
i use it for rice and asian chicken dishes all the time
wow
i have never, ever felt so attacked
i'm coming to brazil just to kick your ass and eat meat
you better have some good bbq prepared
i really fucking hate sushi, the idea of eating raw fish frightens me
<:WutFace:459126920349483029>
i've only recently started eating fish and even then it's just whatever i catch
DUDE
IT JUST
IT LOOKS FUCKING GROSS
i seriously can't handle the idea of eating raw meat
<:vomit:417196165239406603>
oh yeah, i was going to ask how the pandemic is going in brazil
i heard it was picking up

on the internet you can almost curate who you speak to
it's pretty interesting
oh nice job saeko
i'm glad you found something
sekiro is fantastic there is no downside to this
you are lost

JOHN EGBERT IS IN _GREAT DANGER_
oh fuck
sean connery just passed away

i have to admit, it's kind of impressive how pervasive this mentality is, that despite all the math and statistics biden \has already lost
no, he had a 25% chance
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/
538 gave him a near 30% chance of winning
if you're using any other predictive group you're a fucking moron
fucking johnson
yeah dero and i both live in butthole town
thank you for your sacrifice
i mean, they have healthcare
yes
we had 101k new cases _yesterday_
it's only going to get worse as we get deeper into winter

gay family time, i love it
the proof of that post is on the fucking white house website https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-national-day-remembrance-americans-killed-illegal-aliens-2020/
i'm not sure why you guys doubt it when trump does mondo stupid shit
he's demonstrated forty billion times now that this is the sort of rhetoric he likes to engage in
because ~~people think he's funny and endearing~~ a  hefty portion of americans are uneducated and don't possess critical thinking skills* fixed that for you
matter of perspective, i don't find it funny
i find it grating and horrible
i remember talking with my gf about him back in early 2016 when the republican primaries were still going, and we specifically brought up the possibility of trump being president
"do you think it's even remotely possible?" "haha, what? no way"
fast forward to now
bah
it's more about cultural influence and seeing how stuff is trending in other places
trump becoming president has been associated with a rise in nationalism and all the rhetoric that follows
i would absolutely not be surprised if there was some kind of effect happening here where trump being elected emboldened nationalist rhetoric in other places too
symptoms can themselves also have an impact on a person, i hate that line
what does that have to do with it, she's correct for both places
not the rap battle, but the bad lip reading
yeah, this is just "grass is greener" rhetoric at this point
i have 10 bucks on it, it's just for fun
i think the current stated chances are worth 10 bucks
not 50 or 100, however much these crazy fucks are betting

there'd be enough delusional rightwingers to form a militia, there's a metric shit ton of them around here and they all like to flirt with the idea of overthrowing a tyrannical government
they probably wouldn't _get very far_ but they would at least try
like i said, a feel like a _militia_ is something that could happen, but i agree with you that civil war is off the table
barring some catastrophic escalation
there are already groups of people who have secessionist ideology at their core, or who will engage in violent means to achieve their ends
civil war though, no, probably not
i like this post misha, it's pretty exhaustive
i would add the detail for the first world war where it had been a significant amount of time since the last armed conflict in many of the nations who participated in world war 1, so people were actually _eager_ to go to war to sort of earn glory for themselves, and fully expected the conflict to be over within months instead of years
but technology spanked their ass and the rest is history
they still had cavalry in world war 1, can you fucking imagine
wait what veli
used by who
i've got plans later in the afternoon but hoepfully should be able to get some SCP in
it's been a while, it'll be fun
BUTTERY MALES
man
there's a local business around here that puts up advertisements for trump
from everything i've been told by locals, the owner of the place is actually a really decent guy, helps out people for free if they can't afford something critical
nice disposition
he's just totally been taken in by the "trump is good for businesses" rhetoric
yes, the stock market is doing well but the average american is not
average meaning lower classes
this guy doesn't own a big business, he's just got the one store
i just have to wonder
because you know that if it came down to it, trump would nix that guy in a heartbeat for the slightest personal gain
how does it feel to be so dedicated to someone who would casually toss you aside in their own interests
yeah yeah, both sides, whatever
it's just kind of transparently obvious with this one
man shut up, i don't like biden
but he at least has a veneer of "i am actually for the american people"
trump has openly stated--multiple times--that he does not give a shit and demonstrates this all the time
okay, so do you prefer the person who probably won't help you all that much or the person who would actively gut you if it meant they came out ahead even slightly
kid sniffer over child molestor
don't forget, trump has a demonstrated sexual attraction to his own daughter and also brags about sexually molesting people
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
i can't tell if i'm just getting trolled right now or what
you realize that trump got a lapdance from ivanka and also he's said he would bang her
like
what more do you want
YOU'RE THE MAN NOW, DOG
in heaven
lat, i'm not making this shit up
i don't care if you also believe this or not, i genuinely think trump would fuck his own daughter if he could get away with it
sigh
i'm not sure why it's this hard for you people to understand where i'm coming from
this is a guy who actively bragged about molesting people in his show
and has raped his own wife
sorry, "allegedly" raped his own wife
tay's appeal is way more satisfactory
we just went over that dero
people have already handwaved it saying "tons of dads say they'd date their daughters"
which i think is kind of weird on its own but is also true, unfortunately
it's more common out here, unsurprisingly
in redneck incest country
hey dero bring me some spicy chicken tendies from the cold deli at the store
i command you
sad!

SPIN THE WHEEL FOR A TREASURE TO TAKE
CAREFUL MY FRIENDS OR I'LL RATTLE AND SHAKE
sometimes we get upsetti spaghetti, maximum regretti, but most of the time we're pretty civil
and we actually kind of prioritize having a space where people disagree with each other?
we're pretty concerned with the idea of turning into an echo chamber or a social bubble
fascist deez nuts
bell btfo
Echo!
kgtac does a really good job of conveying the awkwardness of trying to socialize at conventions and squeezing some humor out of it
raise your dongers
but homestuck isn't bad
for the first half of it
then it gets worse
passable yeah, certainly
it's only once you get towards the very end that it becomes kind of bad
the lilypad is grueling
imagine if rose had retcon powers
yeah to clarify, i didn't say "we are certifiably not an echo chamber," clearly we have echo chamber tendencies like literally any other online group does
we just vocally want to not be one, and try not to be
why did that make me laugh?

yeah daylight savings isn't until tonight

<@!184545248930693120> WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
A CLOSTER INSPECTION
god, i haven't recorded stats in days
i need to get back to that
actually i need to offload this responsibility to someone else
the bot is unreliable
makin the bot already has a function that spits out the daily stats every day at 8 PM EST
those numbers are usually okay but if the bot experiences downtime they're completely unusable
it's safer for me to just manually record the data
it'd be great if the bot could be tweaked to poop those numbers into a googlesheet file or something, and get them in a more reliable way than literally counting every message that gets sent in each channel throughotu the day
Speaking of the new rule, it's time for its first use: <@&770049989967347723> https://homestuck2.com/story/362 update!
you guys remember when i said there were 212 servers following our announcements channel? it turns out there's about 750 servers following our news channel for homestuck 2 updates
turns out we're kind of big guys for you
"SBURB ALLOCATED BLOWJOB" made me laugh
first time in many updates that's happened
i'm actually kind of
enjoying this?
karkat is actually lampshading how i've felt about these last few updates, i'm not sure if this was purposefully planned or if it's just the writers having some self-awareness
i will say though that it feels like thinly veiled commentary again
```KARKAT: I APPRECIATE THAT YOU SEEM TO HAVE DUG YOUR PAN OUT OF YOUR OWN CHUTE THE FEW MICROMETERS NECESSARY TO NOTICE THE PRECISE DEGREE TO WHICH THE WORLD IS BEING JUDICIOUSLY BATFUCKED RIGHT NOW. ...
KARKAT: BUT NOTICING THE PROBLEM AND MAKING MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARDS SOLVING IT ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.

KARKAT: THE NEXT TIME YOU GET THE IMPULSE TO "LEND A HAND", YOU'D BE BETTER OFF CANNING IT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND LISTENING TO THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE IT A LOT LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.

KARKAT: THIS ISN'T AN EXERCISE BEING CONDUCTED IN ORDER FOR YOU TO PROVE YOUR PERSONAL DEGREE OF MORAL RECTITUDE.

KARKAT: AND IF IT WAS, YOU WOULD HAVE ALREADY FAILED MISERABLY! SO DO YOURSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE A FAVOR AND STOP TREATING IT LIKE ONE.```
not good for them
i mean, i kind of agree with the message a little bit
it's complicated
i'm saying that even if i like whatever message they're pushing, they probably shouldn't be using this story to proselytize to people
that's a large reason that a lot of people have disliked it so far, this sort of thing has plagued the comic at various times in the past too
... written by people who are very vocal about using the story as a vehicle for pushing their viewpoints
god dammit
why am i bothering writing out a post for this hs2 update
i need to get in the game
i fucking hate this update
no i hate that homestuck went from having fun, humorous writing to garbage being shoved down my neck
davekat isn't a bad ship, it's just a ship done badly
davekat could be great
but making it this moe shy bullshit is fucking moronic
also having them skirt at the implication so many times
i hate it
i hate everything
what the fuck else do you want me to say
the writing used to bounce, it used to be funny and engaging
it is not those things anymore
end of story
WALLS OF TEXT WALLS OF TEXT WALLS OF _EDGY, ANGSTY TEXT_
to be fair some of my upset is not due to the comic
i'm also going through irl stuff
but that doesn't excuse this shit
<:reeeeee:311032673386627074>
we've known homestuck 2 is something completely different since it _starteD_
one of the most enduring comments people have made about it is that the tone resembles nothing about the original
i'm downloading a FUCKING UPDATE
SHUT UP
anyway that precise thing, that homestuck 2 is a different property being done differently, is _what people have been complaining about_
it has none of the spirit of the original and is a boring, confusing, irritating mess
written by too many people
i'm just fucking vexed as shit
i just got done rereading act 1 and the difference in quality between that and this is fucking _astonishing_
they share almost no similarities and the new stuff has nothing appealing to it
i just want to shit blood
art was fucking great this update as usual
i wish i could pay more compliments to homestuck 2 than just the art all the time
i want to like this story but i just can't
fucking CHRIST
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:741919221214347276>
i'd write in my fucking asshole
NO
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:741919221214347276>
sure belli
as i've said 100 times since this started, i never cared what they _do_ as long as they do it _well_
we have very little sense of what this story is about thematically, or where it might be going
we don't even have a larger mystery to think about
vriska getting captured is the first genuinely intriguing development we've had since it started
like, _how?_
that simple question is powerful
i haven't asked questions about this story in ages
fuck i'm probably not going to be able to join before round starts, i'm almost done downloading update
i guess i was thinking with regard to everything on deltritus
sure, the themes of the candy universe and to a smaller extent the meat universe are sort of apparent
and i agree, the epilogues did them better
i'm just frusrated
the story has no cohesive identity or a real sense of direction
and where it _does_ have those things they're just... not interesting
<:pepeHands:772116167749533726>
why have i invested so much of my time and energy in this story
why do i bother
my ping is literally so high i can't even move
<@!146014279529791488> when i'm standing next to you guys i can hear everything you say, but my ping is like 400 ms
i keep trying to walk through a door and it rubberbands me back into the previous room
i just got home, what's going on
oh boy, a donkey kong remix
qulality inbound
thanks nik
this singlehandedly saved my night
i did yeah
that's what i was reacting to
donkey konga
it's how you know they have true love for their craft
excuse me
what is this
oh right
well i'm glad you're enjoying it
free sekiro dlc is fucking great
it's kind of simplistic but it adds pretty much exactly what i had been wanting
my addiction begins anew, but hopefully not for long
also yeah trump is leaving his supporters in the dust again, to no one's surprise
/r/LeopardsAteMyFace and all that
so did dero
enjoying it so far?
nice
sekiro is definitely my favorite of the games i've played by miyazaki
looking forward to the revamp of demon's souls cuz i've never had the chance to play it on xbox
same with a potential port of bloodborne but i'm not holding my breath for that one
sekiro though just has another layer of depth to it compared to the souls entries
it's in my top three favorite games of all time, no question
```Sony says Demon's Souls PC announcement was 'human error' Later, Sony clarified to PC Gamer that the PC message at the end of the trailer was "human error" and that Demon's Souls would be a PlayStation 5 exclusive. When asked if Demon's Souls would ever release on PC, Sony declined to elaborate further.``` nevermind the dream is dead
holy fucking shit
i love karkat goes to a convention
it's not even in the same league as karkalicious
karkalicious makes me want to dry heave whenever i hear even an unrelated countdown
KGTAC on the other hand is the first homestuck related content to give me goosebumps since homestuck 2 came out
<@!260222802471157760> you should definitely pick it back up and keep going if you dropped it, i managed to enjoy the first 100 pages but the next 100 are pretty transformative
shut
you can house train dogs so you don't handle cleaning up after them
with cats they go in a litterbox so you will always have to clean up after them
they are more demanding
it goes outside
oh right, you don't live in the country
nevermind
they do if they have enough room for it
we have space out here in the country where the dog runs off into the woods and shits there, i never bother with it
the cat lives inside and we always have to clean up its box eventually
i don't like cats
or, really, i just don't like being on the hook for cleaning up after animals
why the fuck would i do anything about that
you want me to track my dog through 10 acres of forest and clean up every time she takes a shit??
are you fucking nuts?
it's not that it's a bad thing, it's just bafflingly pointless
i mean it when i say i live out in the country, i can count the number of neighbors i have in a mile radius on one hand
there is _no one_ out here
my dog runs free into the backwoods of our property and does her business there
fucking city folk, jesus christ
the only thing i hate more than looking after pets is people who don't look after their pets properly
letting waste accumulate in your house is like a surefire way to get me to hate you
just fucking clean it up
it sucks but that's what you signed up for
ss413 hype
lots of games that people have been pretty interested in
i think that playing games on like a rotation would help in keeping people interested
so don't keep a server going indefinitely
have a set block of time once a week where we ping people for TF2, then the next week we do SCP, then the next week we do ss13
gives people something to look forward to and keeps those games from undergoing fatigue
terraria is dead, we already beat that shit into the ground
yeah, trying to catch up in terraria was an exercise in futility
i mean, it was fun hanging around and resource gathering or doing bosses together
never did actually finish borderlands 2
got right up to the end
then the group i was playing with fucking exploded
also unrelated but i keep seeing people on the subreddit saying shit like "i actually enjoyed this update" but for every single update
and i hate to be That Guy but i literally can't understand how
it makes me want to write an essay about how other people's opinions are wrong and mine is right
but couched in less cartoonishly stupid terms
do it no balls
i'll write an essay if YOU write an essay
it'd be a good exercise in trying to explain ourselves adequately
god
frequently enough i try to take a step back and think about how the fandom looks, and how things look for us in particular
like, is all of our ranting really representative of anything meaningful?
it'd sure be handy if there was some kind of CENSUS OF THE FANDOM SO WE COULD _GET A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK_
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
rose lalonde Sees, with eyes wide open!
drew linky, in the depths of despair
temba his arms wide
sorry i was writing another rant on the sub
what are you people bitching about this time
<@!184545248930693120> shut the fuck up you dirty ass post modernist
i hate your implication that taste is more important than attempts to actually discern quality
it makes me angry, it's like an appeal to failure
cy's message is an ancient adage that doesn't even really apply here
there are Things you can point to in this that are fucking shite
oh god, i'm gonna do it
i'm GONNA ***REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE***
it's more that i feel reducing arguments to "it's about taste" is self-defeating and completely nullifies other discussion
if we're going to put things down to "it's just what one person likes versus another" then literally why should we discuss anything ever
i fucking hate that argument because it undercuts EVERYTHING
no tipsy that's not what that means
<@!184545248930693120> i hope you're forced to work for a hypercorporation that makes you literally sell your own sweat for pennies a day
good, good
depends on if you can find a buyer for the raw chemcials
most of the time i feel like appealing to a more gentle rhetoric, where we DO in fact recognize that taste is a thing that can impact how people perceive stuff
but as time goes by i feel like that opens us up to the thing i described above, where it just fucking kills the possibility of a meaningful, in-depth discussion before it has a chance to get anywhere
at a certain point you have to move past that aspect of determining quality because otherwise art literally becomes meaningless
i want to be able to look at something and say "this is good" and provide reasoning for it
i care about that, because it's expressly hypocritical
... yes
this is true
do you see why we're upset
homestuck 2 is as real of a "true sequel" as it's possible to get
it's literally called THE OFFICIAL CONTINUATION
it's in the fucking main page
it was also endorsed by the author of the original comic
how the actual fuck does that shack up with giving the fandom control of where the story goes
no, i don't think it's that big of a deal
why would you do that to yourself moon
WIG WIG WAG WAG WOM
okay cy so we're like making progress
i'm not talking about the ability to enjoy bad things
it's about being able to point out critical features of something and definitively call them out as good or bad
and then there are people who say "you're actually full of shit, x quality is good because i happen to like it"
okay shut up
god damn it now i want to fgfpost but i need to be responsible and set an example
i guess what i'm trying to say is just that i wish it were possible to engage in discourse without someone always trying to undermine fundamental tenets of discussion right out of the fucking gate
gatekeeping is a good thing sometimes, keep morons out
anyway, i don't really know how to answer that question tera
like, fun in what way, humorous?
most of the books i choose to read are enjoyable as a rule, it'd be kind of strange to read a book if it wasn't enjoyable
i realize the fucking enormous irony of saying that after ranting about homestuck 2 for an hour
tera, couldn't it be said that being thought provoking and heavy is in its own way enjoyable?
enjoyable is like a final end-state of construction, a piece of media can be outright bad and still be enjoyable
see, i don't know if i sympathize with that assertion tera
i feel like being able to enjoy something and liking it are like synonymous
i feel like liking something is a natural result of enjoying it
if you enjoy something, you kind of _have_ to like it
mind, i'm speaking in a strictly mathematical sense
you can also enjoy something but not like it for various Other Reasons
enjoying something is like an axiomatic idea
the reasons for why you enjoy something are complicated
but enjoyment is itself like a positive thing
you cannot experience raw enjoyment and have it be a bad thing
enjoyment can be a bad thing for specific, complicated reasons but again we're talking on a very simplistic basis here
in this discussion there are no examples of What is Being Enjoyed or Why It Is Enjoyable
it is just enjoyment
enjoyment is 1 to 1 a good thing
so if you enjoy something, you ostensibly like it
no, the reverse
you can't enjoy a thing and then not like it
yeah, there you go
yeah, i was worried about a conversation like this
i don't want to have to operationalize words every single time i have a discussion
canis i guess i was saying that i feel like discussions get hindered by this sort of interaction, where we can't even agree on a foundation to begin from
we've played witness to this argument about the differences between "ike" and "enjoy" for like an hour
the original idea is no longer relevant, it's been supplanted by whatever this is
i mean, i'm close to ragequitting myself
this is not an entertaining avenue of thought
there's only so far you can get with expounding on the base assumptions of an argument
like i said, this has completely undercut what we were originally going to talk about
regardless of whether you feel this exploration was necessary, it's impossible to deny that it thoroughly overtook what we were originally going to talk about
i shiggy diggy
... is muslim an ethnicity???
i sleep
"look at those funny little markings underneath the pictures, we call them _words_"
bwee
almost forgot it's NNN actually
thanks for the reminder guys
... a scam for what
who on earth is making money off of this
it's just something that's kind of dumb
i totally agree with that
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
who the fuck is spending money on NNN
a scam is specifically something involving the exchange of money or something with monetary value
"i need help not losing NNN donate to my patreon at"
"five dollar tier: i send you an email every day saying whether i have or hvae not lost"
"if at any point you check and it's unlocked, you can tap a button to send an electrical shock directly into my balls"
"YOU WANNA SUCCEED AT NNN?! FUCKING ENLIST ENLIST ENLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIST"
NNN is a personal quest
what the fuck?
this is.... interesting
i don't get it though, how is there profit involved in this
do you have to pay to enlist
`I HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR A VERY PAINFUL MONTH`
it's just something that people are opportunistic about
that's true of basically everything
what even is this garment
i hate that i'm interested in what this could possibly be
oh that's boring
when people say "garment" it usually makes me think of something slightly fancy
holy fucking christ this is awful
moonjail that video is displeasing
i am actively displeased by it
it feels like he's staring into the face of death
props to that voice actor
too bad my internet is literally so slow that i can't play SCP
guess i'll die
yeah have i not told you what's been going on
i live back out near where i grew up, in the middle of bumfuck nowhere
alright then i guess you can go fuck yourself my dude
yikes dude
stopping something without slowing down first
i need stream
i just sat down with food
also it's sunday, so you know what _that_ means
that's right, it's time for some light day drinking
sweet bro that's perfect
CONFOUND THOSE DOVER BOYS
HOW I HATE THEM
i felt good for waking up before noon today but then i remembered that last night was daylight savings
wha
i mean, i'm kind of with lat
i don't enjoy a majority of thanksgiving foods
turkey is alright and i like dinner roles
i don't like mashed potatoes or ham
i also agree with this, christmas has been overcommercialized for years
decades really
it needs to be stopped
we wouldn't officially sanction it, because we don't want to endorse people sharing their private information with each other
but if there's a group of people who want to participate, i don't think we would get in the way of that
parents tried to force feed them to me when i was a young kid, just putting them in my mouth makes me want to throw up
i don't know anything about that, if you can make it work while retaining anonymity that's even better though

have a dedicated time each friday or saturday or sunday to playing together
switch between games each week
otherwise it gets tiresome

the only thing i use notes for is to mark people's original names so if i ever get confused about who someone is, i can doublecheck and see if someone just changed their name

<@!111477124384202752> i already brought up the idea of doing multiplayer mod with dero actually
she doesn't quite feel like it right now but it sounds like it could be very fun
i haven't tried the mod yet, is it a big file
i would really enjoy fallout 4 together i guess
make it more interesting than it is alone, for sure
what even is genshin impact
oh right, that shit
what the actual fuck

i love it, but it's terrible
you know what i miss all of a sudden though? GTA V online
yeah, but it was still fun
because no one plays it anymore because it's bad
GTA online is something rockstar made to suck whales off
hey guys i've been feeling under the weather since i became a legal adult, donate to my patreon so i can...
BASED CRINGE BASED CRINGE BASED CRINGE BASED CRINGE BASED CRINGE
so the vtuber thing, actually, i have a question
how did that start, and what is the general "attitude" surrounding their existence among fans
like, is it treated with the appropriate degree of distance ("these are just fake anime girls don't worry about it") or are there a hefty number of fans who treat them like they're actually genuinely real
yes, i was more referring to anyone who might view this content and then get mad at others when they recognize that it's a personality and not a real person
<@!125433170047795200> i have come to appreciate the moscow mule a bit more
a kamikaze is great if you want to get fucking blasted but it tastes pretty strong and it dehydrates the fuck out of you
the moscow mule is more gentle, at least with ale instead of beer
and i don't feel like i'm going to fucking piss blood when i'm done with it
alright fair enough misha
i was just worried that there was a significant element of people who literally don't comprehend that it's not real, or who are delusional about it
i wonder what it says about me that i worry about these things
<:huskSalute:668315977070411792>
that is not the emote i wanted to use
okay so hololive _is_ a vtuber thing, i was confused about that
we live in a really strange world
i feel like i'm being overly cautious about this
it feels like a natural extension of like, me listening to vinny playing video games
OKAY UH
whoops caps
looking at this radio closet video, i'm uh
definitely detecting a significant difference
yeah, i don't know why i did this
but it's this kind of principle, right
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
please rip
me when i start learning what all of this stuff is and means
i'll become a vtuber where my persona is just a fucking orangutan

i remember when i was the tired college student
now i'm the tired unemployed sad sack
i need to see if there's any IT work around here, i keep discovering i'm actually not that bad at it
dozle is a sweet man who actually felt the weight of his actions for a second and then waved it off by saying that all of the people they killed just weren't fought for hard enough
yeah i've been slowly getting into it
i think i want to go and watch the 0079 movies _again_ now that i've seen origin
i want to really sink it into my brain
did we already fucking watch thunderbolt???
jesus fucking christ
no, i missed this
i'm sorry, i've been a complete disaster this week
for obvious reasons
yeah just shove that shit in my rectum i'll watch it tonight maybe

god story of my life george
i submitted over 150 applications to places through linkedin and other services when i was initially looking for a job back in june and july
i got one interview out of it
<@!213413608732884994> how old is it
<a:ablobsigh:635255789329580053>
hate job searches
link me i guess
wait, what happened last time
you are being vague
clarify
yeah, thanks for all of the literally no advertisement you ever did for this property fellow traveler
i can finally leave that fucking server
i mean, i honestly don't know why i'm trying to keep up with it
and i don't think i would be welcome in the "official" server so i'm probably just going to stay out of it
how the fuck are they going to have "no mods"
that seems like a physical impossibility
<:spongebobFishYouWhat:669659253111390208>
yeah, i think i'm going to stay out of this
i don't think i miss sky anymore, she drank too much koolaid
no, no
sky doesn't want any sort of centralization at all
she just wants WP to control everything the fandom does
cuz those two things are completely reconcilable
our partnership is based on the subreddit
i don't think they can get us departnered, but they can seek partnership of their own too
i want to appreciate sky and keep her as a friend but there's a level of simping and willful ignorance that i just can't ignore
she reached it when the emails came out
so like, eh
she can do what she wants, i'm just tired
sky never openly shit on us, she was banned for horny
griever is basically dead to me
wouldn't surprise me
let them put effort into moderating a community and having to keep an eye on it 24/7 if they want to completely avoid any problems whatsoever
i'm still very bitter at being lambasted by various WP staff members for the mere _occurrence_ of problems on our server
they didn't even specifically take issue with us handling the stuff, they just used the fact that problems happened at all to say we were bad at our job
i think that was the start of me not giving a shit about what they think, that's pretty unreasonable stuff
yeah basically 1011
the complaints i'm voicing right now are all old, as far as the development of their own server is concerned i've maintained for a long time that they _should_ do something like this
they clearly desire more control over fandom space, even if they weren't particularly motivated to make one for themselves before
we'll see how that works out git
i'm going to make a prediction
let me think of exactly what i want to predict
their server will not exceed more than a quarter of our total activity over the first year of its existence
<@!184824419300933632> not even as a joke
you would think lat
we'll see what happens

that's HVSD
that's probably more than the fellow traveler's discord though
i can't tell because i left the FT discord already
how much is 10 reals, like 3 cents
i kid
i'll take you up on that bet, and if i lose i'll double it for free
actually fuck it if i lose i'll fork over 10 bucks
you're only on the hook for 10 reals though
as long as i actually get brazilian currency
i like having foreign money
we'll work it out when the time comes
that's what i predict lat
ooh boy
already two problems with this
the first and initial problem is that if they have a large influx of users and an explosion of activity for the first week or so of their existence, they won't have enough space for that discussion to take place without crowding out various people who feel like chat is too specific and/or going too fast, so they'll lose people that way
the second and eventual problem is that without other associated channels, the range of discussion will be severely limited and people will stop talking as they lose interest and don't have anywhere else to go
that's even worse vR
but i mean, this is also the first night
maybe they'll change that later
maybe an announcement later
dude i'm not seething
i'm literally pointing out issues with what they're doing
i guess this goes back to that quote about like
"don't point out when an opponent is making a mistake" right
whatever
i'm just going to grab more beef

i'm definitely strong but i have a lot of padding, ie fat
no, why would i do that
getting punched hurts
the "stated average" for intersex conditions of any kind to happen is something like 1 in 1,100
it's not very common
i don't feel comfortable trying to contribute to this because it's not in my realm of expertise
i learned about chromosomal disorders in undergraduate school but that doesn't count for much
intersex stuff is like The Realm of Uncertainty for me
when speaking in generalities, i'm most comfortable with the realm of logic that says sex is related to phenotype and gender is related to social experience
as soon as you start inserting exceptions to those generalities i'm out
i don't want much to do with that discussion
i would feel more comfortable engaging in discussions like this one, except that most people actually have some kind of view they want to assert instead of just talking about it in a more clinical standpoint
it would be one thing to talk about it in terms of "these conditions exist"
instead it's "these conditions exist AND THUS MY VIEWPOINT IS RIGHT"
i specifically don't want anything to do with that
a fear, admittedly i haven't seen that happening in this discussion too much
there is some assertion happening that intersex people existing invalidates the generality i described earlier but i don't think anyone is particularly animated about it
i'm just a wiener

I JUST FINISHED WRESTLING SOME JABRONI HERE AND UH, KNOCKED HIM OUT
the inherent difficulty is that any number of disorders can show up due to the nature of how genetic mutation works
"there is more room for study" applies to literally _everything_ you see that's related to biology, _especially_ in matters of health
saying that there's a dearth of research in one area is pretty worthless, chances are we're already aware of that problem
i can't count the number of times i've seen the phrase "more study of this area is needed" because that's basically the universal truth of anything related to the finer matters of biology
probably not b3es, i'm thinking in terms of the fact that not every sperm or egg cell is the same
every single sperm and egg cell has a different set of genes that it took from the parent
so even if both the sperm and egg came from the same person, each resultant zygote would probably end up at least slightly different from one another
ergo, they wouldn't be clones
now, how many scientific experts are there that study this kind of thing
_especially_ with something this politically charged, and _especially especially_ with something that involves humans
andrew banned
you wanna have the FDA shoot directly up your butthole?
yeah, hermaphrodite has very unpleasant connotations
but i don't know what the more appropriate wordage is
see: iceland
well, per my own customs that would be kind of unusual, but as long as it's consensual and there is genuinely nothing weirder about it than the fact that they're first cousins, i would probably get over it
the world is made up of places with different ideas of morality than my own
noooo
i find that older research tends to be more blunt when discussing things in terms of personal satisfaction
i read a lovely paper discussing an ordination strategy for visually depicting data written by a fellow back in like the 80s, and he made no attempt to censor himself
"This strategy is a complete farce because it violates the principles listed above."
"Do not do this; it seems palatable because it has been rendered in a manner that seems easier, but it will cause your ordination to warp and skew in undesirable ways. Avoid at all costs."
like, yes, i wish i could be that acerbic in modern scientific writing
yeah basically
now it's all about being _supportive_ and _professional_

your question automatically answered itself because trump is actually a fascist, even if he's fucking incompetent at it
i don't know what to tell you
you have a guy who is literally encouraging his followers to commit acts of violence against his political opponents
that's pretty much knocking on fascism's door
like, did you guys miss the whole thing where a _literal caravan_ of his supporters harassed a biden tour bus and briefly tried to run it off the road
and then he saw this and retweeted it with support
he's done this many times in various circumstances
holy fucking shit i hate you, just a moment
https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/02/trump-caravan-biden-bus/
```After a caravan of President Trump‚Äôs supporters surrounded and delayed a Joe Biden campaign bus on a Texas highway on Friday, the Democrats on board canceled the rest of that day‚Äôs events, citing safety concerns, and federal and local law enforcement opened investigations into the incident.

‚ÄúIn my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong,‚Äù Trump said in the tweet. ‚ÄúInstead, the FBI & Justice should be investigating the terrorists, anarchists, and agitators of ANTIFA."
...
On Saturday night, Trump shared a video of the trucks following the bus on the highway along with the message, ‚ÄúI LOVE TEXAS!‚Äù At a campaign rally in Michigan on Sunday, Trump also claimed his supporters were ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù the bus.
...
‚ÄúThe real story is that the left is trying to extort votes out of peaceful citizens under threat of rampant violence, just like in all of the cities leftists burned this year in their 'peaceful protests,‚Äô ‚Äù Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.```
```‚ÄúThese Trump supporters, many of whom were armed, surrounded the bus on the interstate and attempted to drive it off the road,‚Äù he said in tweets recounting his experiences. ‚ÄúThey outnumbered police 50-1, and they ended up hitting a staffer‚Äôs car.‚Äù ```
this is like the latest in four hundred million examples of his supporters doing something that they would crucify democrats for doing, and then he looks at it and goes "THIS IS GREAT! Also the real problem is Antifa."
if you haven't seen examples of this by now you're fucking blind
https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jlj3ss/us_election_biden_event_in_texas_cancelled_as/gaphgtc/
more examples of praising violence against his opponents or engaging in similar rhetoric
because some of us are tired of it
knowing something is bait doesn't help when it succeeds in making us upset
i'm pretty tired of dealing with all this
people who don't give a shit are just fine with it
fuuuuuuuck
oh hey more gundam talk
did magi actually say that? i got the impression he's just tired of your rhetoric
and was mocking it openly
i would also be doing that but i'm not that clever or fast
to be fair, it also seems to me that you do way more defending than dunking
like, 90% of our conversations over trump have been one of us bringing up some shitty thing he did and you going "akshually"
and then saying some shit that doesn't really make it any less bad
yes, that's what i was going to comment on tarty
this feels like the point of someone who is less familiar with the internal workings of what's happening here
which
misha is _from brazil_
i don't exactly expect him to know 100% of what's going on within america, that owuld be egocentric to the max

yep, we have the humidity too
100% humidity when it's 90-100 F outside

eurovision is fucking awesome
you're just a fascist <:TenseiFace:243174946178596864>
yeah mines, that was the round where i was talking to him because he started shooting everyone when we got to the elevator
i said "dude, i have been peaceful this entire time, why are you shooting me"
he was all like "well... hmm... i guess it's my job"
then you fucking merced him
you literally saved my life while i was talking my way out of death
and then i died to gates two more times yesterday

i wonder if i should just explain it all again or if i should find the last time i explained it and link it here
let me find the original explanation i guess
here it is kosh https://discordapp.com/channels/152981670507577344/184908151185866752/707805369614991400
<@!117481170228346880> the other thing that comes to mind is when brapposting started getting really bad
in retrospect i think it was due to the placement of some _really_ fucking good memes
and then mostly woc
yeah basically krato, i was just about to link the nesquik conversation
https://discordapp.com/channels/152981670507577344/184908151185866752/726595030688596062

the moscow mule is really growing on me though

i say "another kamikaze" but it's more like six kamikazes
yes moon now SHUT UP
no, it's still the ale

wait a second what's going on
<@!125433170047795200> what the fuck do you two mean, "roleplay"
did they actually take arquiusbot <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
boooooo that's a way more boring answer
i would have fucking _loved_ it if arquiusbot somehow became used there too
i'm not drunk enough for this
give me a few minutes
i don't have any weed, i'm not a shitty stoner
minecraft update when
also just give it a bit kosh
i'm starting on my drinks
it should be
it might inject some life into the game that it's been needing for some years
see _this_ for yourself: <:robotass:737043838761304084>
wait, so
what exactly is hermitcraft
yawn
are there any fun challenges to do in minecraft
i might fuck around with it for a while before the cliffs and caves update
i ain't no speedrunner
maybe i should replicate the NAND game where you recreate a computer from logic gates, and see how far i can go before i get fucking bored
nah i've done logic circuits in minecraft before
i made it so that a lava gate i had built would open if one or the other switch were flipped on, but not both or neither

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEE
WHY
b
just shot the shit with my grandpa
he's cool
that's all there is to say on the matter
<@!125433170047795200> the verdict is in
i'm fucking myself up tonight
i didn't have anymore lime juice but i have this offbrand key lime soda
i poured the rest of my triple sec and vodka in
this might be htat night
i might discover religion
i'm wallowing in my sorrow as a millennial who doesn't get to buy a house
i forget wwhat the conversation was about that was part of it tho
<@!168980988477702145> shut up zoomer
it was fun meeting with you in california
we should do that again
but in oregon
oregon sounds fun
what if dero came with
silence
answer my question
cool
dero is chill where it matter
ss
she's also funny where it matters
everyday
also dero hurt her back today
so she might not answer
we were gonna play coop dark souls 1
and eventually coop sekiro
i think she just slept on it wrong like a fucking noob
<@!146014279529791488> welcome to being old you fuck
i fear for that possibility
i've been there at least three times
but you know what
we all make sacrifices
oh no
it's today
also working with dirt makes you stink
i would know
i was stink man
dirt man
dirt stink man
FUCK YOU IT'S YEAR
i want a print of that
i would hang it up right above where i sleep
"oh no it's today" was literally every day that i woke up in the like one month prior to my thesis defense
i want it NOW
oh god
i can feel the alcohol coursing through my veins
it's dimming my very actions
i am devolving
i am
becoming
monke
this isn't even a kamikaze
this is just me saying "fuck it, what's left in my fridge"
i literally poured the rest of my triple sec and vodka into this and said "i have no lime juice, what do i have that works instead"
also i'm eating battered and fried pork chops
my grandpa is fucking cool okay

i would never
i would only do this in like a mines of moria situation
where we're being surrounded by goblins and need to escape
i can't remember, i haven't watched lotr in a while
we should do that
surprisingly apt comparison
we should have another lotr stream though
let's do it, for real
i think i still have those on my computer, i can get it set up
oh i don't know about that
JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN
i'm torn
between whether i should start watching lord of the rings this instant
or
gundam 0079 movies
<:ree:475542526791516170>
i don't have the extended versions
guess it doesn't really matter then, does it
in musical theater???
i guess nothing would change because that's fucking worthless
wat
...
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
too late
i am here and fucked up
this is literally the first time i've heard of this
i'm pretty sure it's lat being hyperbolic as usual
give me the receipts
are you a fucking moron
give us proof that penumbra has been doing this
then shut the fuck up until you're out
why are you looking at me
i'm drunk
tay what are you trying to suggest by invoking my name
that i should like
stop this discussion?
<@!195290352838508544> i for one love it when you shut the fuck up
ez lyfe
in modchat
we're done discussing this publicly
thanks for bringing it up lat
liek i said, never heard of this before
we'll handle it internally
so everyone shut the fuck up before i start passing out bans like my farts
i don't care what you have or have not done
this is the first time i've seen it
that's all i care about
so again
shut the fuck up
we'll talk in modchat
<@!227181775221161984> to be clear, i view you as a hyperbolic shit meister
i take what you say as seriously as it must be
just keep that in mind
you fuck
coming from you that doesn't mean a lot
you would pin my daily bowel movement if you could
that's right kids, drunk linky is here and i'm going to slay thots
until i get too drunk to think straight and i pass out on my bathroom floor again
look forward to updates from woc's personal server in the #posts_while_shitting channel
FUCK IT. HOMESTUCK ARCHIVE UPDATE THAT'S ACTUALLY WORTH KNOWING ABOUT
thank you for your service bambosh
you are the best person here, forever
<@!227181775221161984> if you keep trying to suck in non-mods for this mod issue i will personally ban you
now be quiet
i've had it with you trying to stir shit
what
oh
you meant
modification
yes
i thought you were loosely alluding to the previous discussion
nevermind, i rescind my chastisement
proceed
seriously, i am really far gone
i'll make you a bet triop
i don't know
i'm sorry i just made myself laugh
how about
if i yak tomorrow, you get five dollars
wait
that's a stupid bet
there's gotta be something about this that makes it more interesting
i can't tell what that would be right now unfortunately
swish i dont' even want to remember election day
i plan on spending the next 48 hours in a coma
i want to make it clear that that was a joke
just sayin
just saiyan
super saiyajin
super saiyajin deez nuts lol
look, this has been a really hard week
i know i drink recreationally already but
like, really
i don't know that i even want to go into it
nik i'm eating those right now
they're dleicious
trip the thing is
when you vague it like "you don't even want to know"
it just makes people want to know
i will give the very short version
when my grandma died, i saw everything
i had a nightmare about it last night
yeah, a week ago per tuesday
got woke up at 4:45 AM because she collapsed and wasn't responding, we called the EMTs and they spent an hour trying to resuscitate her
i got a front seat to that and i think it's something i won't be able to ever get out of my thoughts
no, let him do it
i shouldn't be talking about this
i'm done
i don't have health insurance
it is
i openly recognize that now
i have no recourse
i'm just going to fuck off
you want me to fly down to venezuela for therapy?
local psychologists are like hundreds of dollras per sessio
i still have so many porkchops
it'll be fine eventually nik
i don't think i've been traumatized to the point that it will "haunt me" or some shit
it's just that it happened less than a week ago
give it a month and i'll probably be okay
i'm gonna eat so much ice cream you have no idea
i'll be frostier than st. nick's butthole
i already gave an extremely explicit recounting of details with one of my extremely close irl friends, i think that's as much as i need to do
BRERB
<a:anumbersNUMBERS:394370289036820480>

apropos, to be sure
fuck you for being vague

technology is truly amazing
can you imagine describing this video to someone from ten years ago?
especially 20?
<:loss_jpg:354791933375152129>
i made a deliberation while i was cleansing myself in the bathroom
i think i'm going to do everything i can to make this day as shitty as possible
i'm going to sustain this general level of drunkenness as long as i physically can, and then instead of going to sleep i'll be using some energy drinks in the fridge to stay awake until a "proper" time to go to sleep in the afternoon
WHY NOT
_WHY NOT_
i will not be dissuaded
shut up
I'M UPSET
I'M GONNA RIDE THE WAVE

that's right mines
i want to shove the entire array of human existence into my cerebellum in a 24 hour period
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE TRANSHUMANIST
i'm probably going to fail this challenge in like two hours
we'll see what happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGRYgkdrgVQ
look, i don't really know what's up
i'm just filled with so much disgust for the general human condition right now
we all deserve better than what we've got and yet we need to put up with so much shit just to exist
i'm tired of it
i'm indulging in my extremist tendencies for the night
i'll be fine
i always am

WORKSHOP DAT TWEET
what is it carl
oh
hm
you know, you have a point
i'm suddenly freed to do the sleep experiment
i can probably pursue that before i obtain a job
i would have to start it on a day i'm not fucking myself up as much as i possibly can though
this doesn't count, i'm just being obstinate because i hate the conditions i've been put under
the question is what to do with all that anger swish
what are we supposed to do?
there are such monstrous injustices that face us as a species and as individuals
how can you possibly surmount those things
HERE'S YOUR FUCKING ART
the ability of any human to be cruel towards another human is cause for fear and anger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQDPHp0jGkk
tm, i'm tired of being frightened and anxious and sad
i just want to stop
you know, i should probably go through the campaign of red dead redemption 2 again
it has all of the aspects of overcoming personal hardship and strife that one can ask for
i am approaching nonsense
kosh i just hate that it's possible for people to undergo hardship
i didn't ask to be here and neither did anyone else, yet here we all are
struggling in our own ways
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:741919221214347276>
I'M FUCKING ENRAGED
I'M GOING TO INDULGE IN MY EMOTIONAL STATE OF AGITATION

the only way out is to try and remember all of the good times too

its age shows rather terribly for a game released in 2000
but its influence on modern works is clearly visible

it's easily one of the best 6/7 dollar purchases you could make
it's the janky combat that'll get you
guns are useless, do whatever it takes to survive until you get the ultimate melee weapon
then just fucking destroy everything
i was a pacifist run until i got that thing
then it was like
"why would i do literally anything else"
true that
the moral ambiguity goes out the window
<@!173936231229554688> do you have even a single fact to back that up?
jthat's the kind of election day spirit we need
he is relatively woke
how interesting
https://i.redd.it/a5embjf9j0x51.png
yeah kosh has argued this before and it still takes me completely off guard each time i think about it
he is literally saying that the popular vote doesn't matter because of the way the population works, which blows my _fucking mind_
it's kind of amazing how frequently KGTAC makes me laugh
twice in one page
```FCG: I HATE EVERY SINGLE VERSION OF YOU DAVE.
FCG: YOU GROW UP INTO EVEN MORE OF AN INSUFFERABLE BASTARD CHILD.
FTG: haha yeah```
```FAC: Wait, did you really mean all of what you said up there?
FCG: YES.
FTG: nah
FTG: hes fine with you
FCG: DO NOT TALK FOR ME SHIT BULL.```
just got me good
at some point i'm sure we will
also yeah why the fuck did you  freeze the channel for like two hours for talking about politics if you were just gonna bring it back up immediately
have some consistency you fucking dummy

also misha it's kind of debatable as to which one he's better known for at this point
HMMMMM
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
alright kanye
enjoy your next bipolar breakdown
i have very little respect for kanye west
defenses of him involving his bipolar disorder don't really persuade me, more reasonable people recognize that they have this problem and actually try to do something about it
he just indulges in his mood swings to a degree that's gross
he also sells really shitty clothes and people eat it up because they have no sense
you remember when he sold like a plain white t-shirt
how much did those go for exactly, like 60 bucks??
astrology needs to be criminalized
<:pog:576614562598748213>
yeah that's usually a floridian thing
florida doesn't have a problem with it, they let their freak flag fly
is this yet another phrase that has been deemed problematic and i'm not aware of it
<:PogChamp:301366798228652043>
peace and love
YER BABY
about 15-30% of females born with down's syndrome are still fertile but for obvious reasons they usually don't reproduce anyway
if they do, the child has a much higher chance of also having down's syndrome
affected males are typically viewed as infertile due to defective spermatogenesis but it's also likely that some are still fertile and just don't know how to have sex
that's not a joke by the way, that's the actual scientific consensus
the report i read didn't distinguish between the two, so i assume they're taken together
i'm also not an expert on chromosomal disorders, i could be talking out of my ass
i like to make it abundantly clear when i'm not an expert on stuff so that i can also make it abundantly clear when i AM an expert on stuff
it makes things easier for everyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PipzizkF-SY
and yet here i am, posting it before you
who is the real loser
inb4 "all of us"
IT'S OVER IT'S OVER BIDEN BTFO
hoo boy
i shared that this morning
fun stuff
ah, taking a leaf out of trump's book and calling it too early, i see
peace and love
GUYS
HOLY SHIT
LOOK
you're not funny
that is correct, early votes such as mail-in and absentee
those usually get counted last
first in, last out
**i understand you have to tell everyone that**
it's very early dero
although with 22% of the votes counted that's pretty interesting
usually the earliest reports are from smaller, more rural areas too, because they have less votes that need to get counted
they're predicting a turnout of about 67% or so, which hasn't been the case in decades
or absentee ballots
both my gf and i voted absentee this year
as well as like 96 million other americans
75% of the vote counted in florida and biden is _still up_ by over 1%
that's better than i expected
yeah, fair cheeze
it's still kind of eye opening
how much did trump win florida by in 2016

florida really isn't that important anyway, it'd be neat to see if it turned blue but you guys are focusing on it overly much
florida going to trump was a given pretty much from the start
pennsylvania is the real nailbiter
shut up monke
I'M GONNA VOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTE
seven billion times tonight apparently
can't wait to be disappointed in my home
yeah, of course we did
https://gfycat.com/coolzealousdevilfish
it's even better with sound, can't tell why that isn't in the embed
terrible
<:fearblob:553434591105646593>
arizona gonna start reporting in soon, it's early voting reported first so it'll start strong for democrats but probably run up more republican as time goes by
sigh
does penn count the early votes first or last
interesting
ehhh
those are older millennials
hussie is like on the cusp between gen x and millennial
a more typical millennial right now is in their 30s to 20s
mid 30s to mid 20s let's say
i'm definitely a millennial, one of the later ones
i'm 26
i think that assessment more or less tracks with most people
seemingly the chest
i'm getting ready to hibernate for the next four years
i wasn't exactly expecting a blowout and biden does admittedly still have a path to victory, but this does not speak well of the american people
if biden loses again i just give up
i thought people were better than this
as long as trump doesn't win ohio by more than 1 or 2 points things look kind of okay for pennsylvania still
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
proceed
i highly doubt we're going to kick out anyone who's not an adult
content ratings only matter if you're an official retailer or something
we are explicitly not an official group
also no horny in here because it's against Discord TOS _and_ it leads to a shit ton of problems
we don't want to encourage the sort of people who are horny to the point of being problems, or who make other people uncomfortable
<@!257144766901256192> go to bed you fucking disaster
i'm already giving up hope
just gonna take a break for the next four years and become a dirt ape
moon, i would love it if biden won still but at this point i'm mostly just disappointed in other americans
they've been duped and instead of changing when it was pointed out to them, they doubled down on it
so like, eh
i don't have the motivation to give a shit right now
no i can also za warudo
i just generally don't see a reason to
i'm gonna DOOOOOOOOOOOM
my two cents is that i definitely don't think things are "the worst they could possibly be"
but i also think that continuing down this road is a bad idea and could lead to things getting a LOT worse
yeah, he was always going to win here
and the corollary to that hitler image: "literally any comparison to hitler, no matter how minor and/or accurate, automatically invalidates your argument because people are terrible at critical thinking skills"
<:karkatEvans:638142963481968650>
i hate today
<@!207991389613457408> i don't want to hear it
here's the dirty part
if we were in the reverse situation, i don't know whether i would be just as smug as you are
THE RED COMET STRIKES AGAIN
what is this "red mirage" shit i'm hearing about all of a sudden
i mean, this seems pretty strictly set misha
are you just taking the piss
because i could use an extra hundred bucks right now, things are tight
i was more pointing out that your bet seems extremely unlikely at this point
<@!343831026373623808> yes i was being serious, i don't know if the red mirage is the same phenomenon as shy trumpers or if it's something different
i keep seeing people pull shit out of their ass at the last moment
so what exactly is it
oh okay, that's all it is
don't know why they needed to call it that
https://i.redd.it/kaptc0c4c3x51.png
fun fact, that's a female orangutan so her name should be georgina
isn't susan collins the shitbag
i mean, fox news was the only one who made that prediction
and clearly it was premature
yeah
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
suck it zoomer
which would be very boring
for some reason, biden being creepy and handsy with women has been a death sentence for him, as opposed to trump literally bragging about sexually assaulting people
biden didn't run because he was mourning a loss in the family
he didn't have it in him that year
i think the point fae is going for is that our justice system is not actually a perfect representation of justice, so denying people the right to vote based on incarceration is dependent on the fact that you're leaning on a system that admittedly has its deficiencies
people shouldn't be incarcerated for drug use and yet they are
those people are subsequently unable to vote
you have this chicken and egg problem of people who violate the law can't vote even though they shouldn't have gone to jail depending on the exact thing they did
why on earth does limiting one, uniquely informed right automatically mean that their other rights should be violated too?
criminals still get _fed_ while they're in prison
you're presenting this as internally consistent logic and it's really not
alright i'm tired of seeing this
the next person who relies on some stupid insult instead of sticking with their point only is getting banned for the night
<@!207991389613457408> <@!117481170228346880> <@!343831026373623808> <@!195585050509574144> and anyone else who was doing it
we talked about making a politics containment channel earlier this year during the primaries, it was shot down by almost everyone as being a bad idea because politics channels degrade into complete shit
yeah, you think this conversation is bad?
shut the fuck up
i'm just gonna become hikikomori after this, i have no desire to participate in society and honestly haven't for a while
i'll survive off my own fat stores
i'm starting to think georgia might actually go to biden, personally
ugh
alright enough of this
shut up
a winner is you!
no, it doesn't actually seem that way anymore
i mean, it might
but pennsylvania is no longer the only state that matters
horny is banned
according to SOME projections, but clearly reality had different plans
i keep finding myself grinding my teeth and it's hard to stop
inb4 he declares victory already
i do
what do you mean
<:waitwhat:316648744579760128>
revolvers have advantages and disadvantages to them just like pistols do
what are we even talking about in terms of owning one
i'm pretty sure we're talking in terms of self defense right
and you think a militia uprising is somehow _more_ likely than a home intrusion??
well, whatever floats your boat i guess
yeah, what the actual fuck
nothing arguable about it, we live in a shit hole
how could we forget
death
burn in hell, little one
i don't recall, which one was that
it's late and i don't remember this so let's say no
but
AP just announced arizona for biden
this election is all kinds of fucked up
i hope not
```‚ÄúRight now, Democrats are very depressed. Even if they win the political fight, the moral fight is lost. After snatching babies from their mothers arms, after 240,000 American deaths, there was a hope of a true repudiation of Trump. And clearly that is not happening‚Äù```
i thought it was pretty clear
even _if_ democrats win the presidency and other races around the country, this was nowhere near a blowout
it's hotly contested at best
and healthcare
the good parts of canada are very heavily outweighed by the bad parts of canada, ie anything french
alright, give us an example then
what would you say is the worst atrocity ever committed by the canadian government against people on its soil
iceland kind of _does_ want you, if you're skilled enough
they sort of need the fresh blood in their genetic pool

COME
TO
BRAZI
someone post the video
<@!184545248930693120> shut
not the video i meant but that'll suffice
what's that uninhabited strip of land in the middle east that no country will claim because it's basically worthless?
let's move there
you know what i'm talking about because we discussed it in here the other night
also it's not about raising property values, it's about being left alone
alright, you earned it
miserable
i feel completely deflated and motivationless
i just want to sleep for a while and not think about stuff
need to find a job though
let me go brush my teeth
does someone want to do me a fvor
i've fallen so far behind on tracking data that i just don't even want to fuck with it
i'd really appreciate it if osmeone could help me catch up
the server
i record numbers like total messages sent in a given day and in what channels
how many people joined/left
mostly that
the bot doesn't do a good job
and yes homer
here let me send it
be warned that i don't have excel so it's freeware, apache actually

oh my god, fuck me, i'm like a week behind
<:justmiserable:688218021440782384>
it's not that difficult, it's just a little annoying to go through and do it multiple days in a row
basically you set your computer's clock to universal time and then do during: x day in: y channel
so like
in:general during: 2020-11-01
then you record the number for that day and then move on to the next channel, which would be altgen
you know what, saying all of this out loud makes me realize how batshit it is, i'll just take care of it tomorrow
<a:pensiveWobble:530000479401279490>
the biggest help would just be giving me the numbers for messages sent in channel each day
channel order in the "daily channel messages" tab is: general, altgen, mspa-lit, serious, bot-commands, fathusky, homestuck, homestuck2, hs-art-cosplay, art-cosplay, oc-hell, music, gaming, western, eastern, science, coding, and then i can take care of the ones past that
it includes the mod chat and then the patreon channels
<@!146014279529791488> but i am le tired
because i've lost control of my life
fuck you
anyway it's really not that big of a deal, i just need to suck it up and get it done
if you want to take care of the channel counts though i'd appreciate it immensely
once i'm caught up i can avoid falling behind again hopefully
it's complicated
arquius also reports on numbers each day but it's not really copacetic with how my spreadsheet works
and if the bot goes down at any point, it doesn't register messages for the time span it's down
which means the count is highly unreliable sometimes
i find it easier and safer to just record the numbers myself
arquius does  make it more convenient to whip out a number real quick though, instead of consulting my fuck huge document
yeah, but they'd have to retool the way arquius reports numbers so that it's using search API or something
it's a lot of work for them and they've already done a lot
yes, good, be excellent to each other
this is what i like to see in here
chat is a really unique place, we're kind of a public mod hangout and talk about a whole range of stuff
a lot of literature but stuff in general too
do check the channel description
<@!266807632390520833> i dreamed about it too, it was deeply uncomfortable
sorry to interrupt this broadcast but i have breaking news

those five comments include one saying "TROLL" and then two having the exact same imgur link to a random fantroll
WAKEY WAKEY
he looks like he wants to gargle my balls
whoa
magis, did you come up with that little blurb about nate silver in his war room last night
okay so it's from the thing yeah
i just opened it up and saw that, and it slammed into my cerebral cortex like a sack of bricks
<:flatHusky:682273112137793546>
<@!207991389613457408> if you could own any mobile suit in real life, which would it be and why
for the sake of "real life" let's say no
but you can include an alternative answer where you are
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
it costs 3 million dollars to recount the votes there, unless it's within one quarter of a percent
i'm sure he has 3 million bucks
either way, this race is definitely interesting
i just want things to be okay for people
that's a pretty swaggy suit
make a chicken hat you fucking losers
race isn't over yet nate
you might still be on the chopping block in the public's eyes
JOE
yeah
data orbital is also a fairly unbiased polling outlet
decently rated
i wouldn't take this as gospel, but still
yeah, you seem to be implying that the supreme court is immune to the partisanship we're seeing throughout all levels of governance right now
the supreme court is 6-3 conservatively stacked, and three of those justices were picked by trump for just such an occasion as this
they would automatically pick whatever scenario helps trump and hurts biden
that is basically their job at this point
it's not SUPPOSED to be, judges are supposed to be nonpartisan
but that is the reality we have been fucking infected with
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
i'm hearing as early as tonight or tomorrow
i mean
at this point the presidential election is kind of inconsequential? the senate is projected to remain in republican hands, which means that even if biden wins the presidency, he is fucking hamstrung

shut up brit bong
i've been dooming longer than you've been _alive_
oh yeah i forget you're one of the adults here
maybe if you were better at paying attention to shit in mod chat i would remember that you're almost as old as i am
wow, that made me physically laugh out loud
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
i need to see this
haven't been to /pol/ in years
<:monkaOMEGA:663106010344587279>
second thread down
tensei did you start this thread
we all wait, hunched over, with shit in hand, waiting for the moment to let fly

fucking JOMAHA
i just want my stimulus check
shove that money directly into my sphincter
AP and CNN too
yep
NYT just listed it as the first flip

oh, i didn't realize, thank you
i agree, it's less premature than fox yesterday but it's still pretty tight with two more sets of votes to be counted tonight

what the fuck is that real?
SHUT UP
I WANNA DOOOOOOOOOOOOM
it's almost like recounts are performative except in highly specific and extremely contested circumstances
because i'm chronically depressed and this year has been very hard on me
this is how i vent
i have tried everything
no but i did try your mom
okay that's enough i wasn't inviting people to start giving me advice
go back to dooming and blooming
but why, tori
you were my favorite
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
un fucking believable
every post on /pol/ is made by the same guy

TRUE
i don't think moot can kill anything at this point
FUCK

i just remember that one time where he posted and it was in the most stereotypically broken english possible
NO
wait so
how do you allocate memory and stuff to the minecraft computer
i saw you were able to choose its RAM, which i assume is dependent on how much ram you have dedicated to minecraft
but what about other components like GPU and CPU
okay, so it's like pre-set out of game
that's pretty cool
i have to admit that i'm not sure what you would get out of it besides the sheer novelty of using a fully functional computer in minecraft
is it possible to interact with out-of-minecraft stuff using only stuff found in vanilla minecraft
i remember something about that
who is DSP
i'm older than you
oh
i don't like this man
what's the response lagtime radio
ah
fair enough, it would probably be better on my machine then
i used virtualbox with an ubuntu setup for all of my grad school thesis work
oh yeah true
java will really fuck you up
yep
gotta love it
<:thonk:538981238082502677>
now i want to try this
i have a lot more RAM to dedicate to the virtual machine
i think my computer has 32 GB of RAM
i'll probably avoid it for now then radio
i'm lazy
<@!205026834205769748> speak english, monkey
yeah i'm officially taking a break from politics
i need to find some fucking food
that too
fuck yeah
well, i was GOING to take a break from politics but here you guys are
btw nat
oh that's great
all hail fat husky
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
who would each political candidate main in smash melee
i bet biden would be a falco main
trump would probably main gano--wow
fucking beat me to it
marth is too soy
+progress
```Conor Sen @conorsen ¬∑ 11m These mail votes coming in Georgia are 20-30pts better for Biden than a normal county baseline. Gotta see how exactly the Fulton/DeKalb/Chatham/etc numbers look but I see no reason why he can‚Äôt do it.```
surely you can just... go find a half-life key
the game has been out for 22 years
remember, the cultural fallout from this political cycle will haunt america for the rest of our earthly lives
which... is precisely why we need to get _off of_ this earth

police apparently have been called to a vote processing facility in detroit
i have no source for this but still
precisely
mind you this doesn't tell you who they voted for, just their party affiliation, but... partisanship being what it is...
shut up yud
a lot of people also lost a fuck ton of money
i was seeing people in the megathread talk about this
pointing out "LOL WHY ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT THE POLLS, THE BOOKIES HAVE IT TRUMP NOW"
like, it either had to be a troll or someone with no rational thinking skills
that's too far tensei, get rid of it
thanks
<:loss:595393082195968001>
isn't mod abuse a bitch?
is that the one from the great dictator
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
well, some people are pretty afraid of clowns
jay is the bard of mind, his takes are skewed in bizarre and occasionally horrific ways
michigan called for biden, as per CNN
that was called hours ago
you mean arizona?
idort
tensei is shaking his ass for an arizona flip
positively twerking it over in his cozy apartment
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
WELL DONE REPUBLICANS WELL DONE, _HOWEVER_
so nat
that's good
now turn off your computer screen and lay there for a while
eventually you'll lose consciousness
I KNOW THIS IS FRIGHTENING
but it's a completely normal process
you'll feel better after you wake up
NO
DO NOT GO TOWARDS THE CAFFEINE
you know, i think i'm going to take this opportunity to put this bottle of wine in the fridge
just in case biden is announced the winner today
i had taken it out yesterday after trump took the decisive lead, but
maybe there is hope after all
i say as a single tear sheds from my eye
if trump is announced the winner i'll shove that bottle right up my ass
yeah actually
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
WAKEY WAKEY
well, it wasn't clear just how much power the mail-in-ballots had
from a purely geographical, day-of standpoint it seemed pretty conclusive
HELLOOO DISCORD
it's the difference between saying "i am the winner! stop the election, i've taken it all!" and "keep the election going, but when it's properly finished, i expect to win"
trump's MO since last night has been to prematurely declare victory despite not actually having it
it's like dewey vs truman all over again
/pol/ has desperately needed a kick in the teeth for years
you have inspired me
i'm going to go pick up some ice cream
be back soon
i take it the news hasn't been good for trump supporters since i left
before michigan was called
was this his thing last night or is this a new thing
oh wait no sorry, i saw michigan get called
trump claiming victory is something we all saw coming from a mile away
jesus fucking christ, that cope video is fucking _off the wall_
"Why are Democrats always so happy?" HAH
today is bizarre
/pol/ is generally a disgusting cesspool 99% of the time as is, no one should ever feel bad for them

thanks linkybot
what the FUCK is this shit with biden milkies
i just banned cy for this earlier
SHUT THE FUCK UP
i think i'm going to temporarily subscribe to /r/conservative just in case they have a melt down if trump loses
they might put their sub on private and i'd miss it
uh huh sure

looking at this megathread is like staring into a mirror universe where people believe a completely different set of information
i'm honestly kind of scared by it

man, i remember back in 2016 when it first hit me that trump was actually going to win
i didn't react like this
after i got over the initial doom feeling, i took a step back and said
"well, who knows"
"maybe he'll surprise us. i want him to be the best president he can"
then he started lying like on day one
misha i guess that's my problem
the existence of indecent people is really demoralizing
when are you starting the stream
sweet, i'm looking forward to it
for some reason i thought you were older than that magi
i was just old enough that i could tell something intense was happening but i still didn't care overly much about politics
like, going through the halls of my highschool as people literally chanted "OBAMA OBAMA OBAMA OBAMA"
yeah basically
wow
life imitates art i guess
i'm not pinning that
better than it did
i'll be satisfied if biden wins with more than a bare 270 EC
270 by itself is fucking awful, in terms of the schism it represents
if he gets more than that then it's at least like... some kind of tangibility
if biden somehow gets pa and ga then that's really good
if we learn the outcome tonight i'll ping you the second i find out
LMAO
i think it's a caricature of obama specifically, bottom right section of the map
yeah i was mistaken
good job tensei, you done goofed
silence
wait, so
i know that fox rescinded their call last night
did they then make the call _again_
oh
that's
yeah this day has been fucking weird
yeah, i voted against that
the actual wording on the ballot was very confusing and it was tied to something completely unrelated
the secondary amendment had something to do with eliminating donations from entities to politicians
which sounded good
but it turns out missouri already has a limit of 5 dollars per person
so the additional reduction didn't accomplish much
losing the nonpartisan structuring committee far outweighed it in importance
that guy isn't totally wrong
like i said, the senate is still in republican hands (pretty sure) so biden won't be able to effectively push policy
i'm looking long term
things look rather dire
that's why i said "totally wrong"
he's wrong about it being biden's fault, but regardless of why that's the future we're looking at
unless the midterms wildly exceed our expectations
what have they said about the election so far, if anything
but that's the ennemy
that would be ifnar 3
yeah, i get the feeling people thought i was joking or exaggerating when i talked about people like this
i literally live in an area where there are people who unironically believe this
wait, so is the implication that someone made that shit up or is jac o'hara a real person who actually said that shit
fair point
<@!188089222958153728> ownership transferred back to makin, we're co-admins
that's basically where we're at jman
as will you, and i
so today has been pretty exciting, huh
i could use a break
that's impressive
what a world we live in
man, trump's campaign grifting its supporters literally to the very end
i wonder whether kosh sees stuff like this and just kind of ignores it or is able to square it away as "dems are just as bad"
yeah, i do
beneath the incessant bait i'm sure he actually kind of cares
that's why i'm curious what he thinks about this
sorry, can't do it
my inner humanist won't let me
they're saying you argue in bad faith and just bait all the time and i'm saying you actually have positions you're trying to defend even if you do it in a shit way
let's not get into that
<@!219540352212795392> that's friggin sweet nyeheheheh
donate to my paypal so i can afford to eat paypal.me/fuckyoui'mnotactuallybeggingforcash
it's not a SHARPIE but there's definitely an Official Ballot Marking Pen that marks _like_ a sharpie
that's standard in missouri elections, i don't know about elsewhere
~~it's toast~~
is it time for a time out
pretty cringe inducing isn't it
GA very well may be mandatory recount territory
and AZ come to think
it meant that he's prematurely declaring victory in order to establish a narrative that he's The Real Winner
he literally said he would do this, multiple times
_HERE'S HOW HE CAN STILL WIN_
oh boy, you DID miss out on a lot
the lore doc is optional
it's just for nerds who care about history

yeah that's a completely accurate screenshot
he said it last night when he was declaring victory in all the states that are still up in the air
let me see if i can get the actual transcript
```

President Trump
Donald John Trump
Chris Wallace condemns Trump claims that he won the election
'Squad' member Rashida Tlaib wins reelection in Michigan
Biden campaign blasts Trump victory claim as 'outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect'
MORE
early Wednesday declared victory in the presidential race against Democratic nominee Joe Biden even as millions of votes were still being counted across multiple states and the president said he would be going to the Supreme Court in an attempt to stop ballot counting.

Trump asserted that he had won states like Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan despite there still being tens of thousands of ballots still outstanding.

No media outlet has called a winner in those states, no election officials have declared a winner and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden may still overtake Trump on the strength of mail ballots that are still being counted in Michigan and Wisconsin.

‚ÄúThis is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election,‚Äù Trump said in remarks from the East Room of the White House. ```
whoops
fucjubng gekk
whatever i give up
```‚ÄúThis is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election,‚Äù Trump said in remarks from the East Room of the White House. 

‚ÄúThis is a very big moment. This is a major fraud on our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we‚Äôll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don‚Äôt want them to find any ballots at four o‚Äôclock in the morning and add them to the list. It‚Äôs a very sad moment,‚Äù Trump continued. 

Trump contradicted himself at times, arguing votes should still be counted in Arizona, where he is trailing, but not in states where he is leading.```
yeah, this is a good person who certainly won't further attempt to dismantle our voting system
get ye rest sparrow
```Former Sen. Rick Santorum, a Republican ally of Trump's, said he was "very distressed" by what Trump had said.

"The president is prone as we all know to bluster and fits of pique, being upset about how he's treated," Santorum said. 

Santorum said it was fine to say he believed he had won, as Biden did earlier, but "the idea of saying, using the word 'fraud' " when people were counting votes was wrong.``` /r/LeopardsAteMyFace
wow, what
is it _actually_ pronounced "neh-vay-duh"?
i was going to say, that's some fucking "missouri = misery" shit
they ner ver der
i wonder _why_ this shift
this is extremely pronounced
wew, is that even legal?? better not open carry that
good luck with _that_ shit
good prof
i can finally say it
_inhales_
_LATE_
Haha
wait, that's not one of YOUR conversations is it
that's just something you found online right
hm
i really have to wonder if the GOP will be able to come back once trump is like, PERMANENTLY out of the picture
it feels like so many people have attached themselves to his image _specifically_
how many of those races were based on trumpist rhetoric and appeals
yeah, why
it's just depressing
oh yeah you were actually _here_ for the stuff with hussie
why _did_ you read the emails <:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
sigh
we didn't even fucking advertise it is the thing
that was like a completely organic transfer
what, in the like three days since it went up? no, you would need at least a few months to reliably be able to look at that information
<@!286433950308630528> here, i can tabulate how many messages have been sent in the homestuck and homestuck 2 channels over the last week, but i don't know how active the official server has been
let me look the info up real fast
you'll have to work fast, there's only so much time
no, they don't actually want to deal with that
man
i kind of, kind of want to join the server but only because i want to keep track of their activity
i feel like that would be viewed as really petty though
lmao really
this would be an addition to my daily efforts with this server qweq
it's not a one time thing
anyway <@!286433950308630528> one second i'm putting this stuff together

this is since the middle of last month obviously
this is for the entire year so far, total on top and average on bottom, same columns
indeed
we'll have to see how things shape out throughout the coming months
yeah, fair enough
i'll join the server when they actually announce it
if that's never gonna happen then i'll join sooner
it's odd to me that they fear their twitter base
seems counterintuitive
makin would never do that for multiple reasons
<@!227181775221161984> i guess i'm just confused and mulling it over at this point
so the server will literally be left to its own devices 100% of the time once it's done being set up
right?
i don't really know what to say about that
i guess it's like
i kind of hate to render it this way, btu
as much as it sucks that they got hit by the whataboutism stick vis a vis "YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT BLM," they probably shouldn't have been using their official media accounts to engage with fans in that manner in the first place
when you play with the identity politics fire you get burned sooner or later
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
no wonder user5 has been quiet in here
but if he's doing a good job then more power to him
i mean, i'm not worried about it so much, i'm more curious about how it'll play out
if you ask me, making a server just to abandon it to the fandom "except in emergencies" makes no sense
it's just gonna fall into destitution _or_ become another place where people regularly call them out over stuff
oh yes
lat, i actually brought up the idea in mod chat of crafting a list of "do not let these people into your mod team/server" and giving it to them but we shortly shot it down as being kind of nosy and probably unwelcome
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
based
tentatively no
user5 seems to have calmed down somewhat, and i'm willing to take the leap to say they have improved and can actively participate in constructive ways
i don't understand what you're talking about qweq
wait, is twonks over there??
we should probably give them that list
oh
thank god
some dude
wow, calling me neurotic?
you're right <:sadCherub:297824511477415938>
after meeting user5 in public, let me put those suspicions to rest
he is
just kidding, user5 is a totally other dude
yeah i met user5 at the chapel hill pgenpodcast deal
you know, you probably _could_ so i'm not even going to dispute that possibility
i am not convinced that hussie has ever stepped foot in this server
he sounds fairly disconnected from the fandom at large these days, except maybe twitter
he does have a discord account, i've seen screenshots of him talking with members of the staff
they always remove his name so i don't know what it is though
i don't really have any desire to find out either
redneck
get out
it was good to see you jman
take care

isn't maricopa in arizona??
yeah, biden is... ahead... in arizona
this is some galaxybrain shit
say what you will about the man himself, trump could be a buffoon or a genius, but his supporters are indisputably fucking lemmings
fucking qanon nutjobs
i don't know if he'll pull it off in GA
i underestimated just how fucking close it would be

hypocrisy is the thing i hate most on this fucking earth
it is the worst form of scumbaggery
i might be late but apparently puerto rico approved a referendum to start appealing for statehood
<@!131650004606648320> MAKE YOUR STATE HURRY THE FUCK UP
carrying swords in public is generally illegal

they don't drink gasoline, t's a woman who sniffs gasoline constantly
like, huffs the shit out of it
chugging it would actually lead to like... suffocation, interestingly
due to the incredible volatility of the chemical
it just turns from liquid to gas at a rate that it would keep trying to escape from her stomach and she would keep breathing it in
the process is interesting
the result is horrifying
be quiet, insolent wiener
god damn you
ARE YOU READY KIDS?
I CAN'T HEAAAAAR YOU
GOOD
IN YOU GO
man, that donald duck cartoon is adorable
i love when simple differences between cultures are depicted in an amicable way
donald going for the handshake and the parrot just full on wrapping him up in a hug and going on
i assume that was a brazilian stereotype back in the day
i'd probably get along well there then
i give good hugs
so... not everyone fits the stereotype
that's pretty normal
maricopa is arizona
did they actually say that kreuz
i fucking hate nevada
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
i prefer the version with the curb your enthusiasm theme
it's amazing just how _stunned_ he is though
like you can see the gears turning in his head
WHAT
there are also fat furries too
what about it
yes, that's a beer
<@!227181775221161984> you need a time out
no
i was just saying you need a time out
reminds me of being at a convention
LITTLE TIMMY
or LITTLE TIMMY THE ACCOUNTANT if there's room
good shit
same as it was last night
are you ever not sleepy
i don't believe you
anyway we're waiting on four states: NV, PA, GA, and AZ
they're very tight
things looking pretty good for biden though
https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/1324415365439463424?s=20

i hope so
aaaaand discussion over
<@!257144766901256192> i actually decided to hit up crash bandicoot today
i don't remember ever beating the first game but i just got done iwth the first island
will probably try to complete it within the next week
very challenging, i like it
it feels janky in some respects but it's also pretty old
you're trolling right
yeah tensei
all of the physics are pretty much the same
that's banjo kazooie
crash bandicoot is a completely different property <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
no, they're not the same at all
so if you're a moron? sure
nah i was talking to interro because he's saying a thing i don't like and it makes me angery
clearly this deserves insults
you must be this boomer to ride the HSD
anyway crash bandicoot is like a rail platformer and banjo kazooie is explorative
also crash bandicoot isn't even really a collectathon
the main gem you collect to progress in the game is found as a natural result of completing the level, everything else is completely optional
hell, the first game doesn't even HAVE a main gem to collect in each level, they're ALL optional
notes and jiggies in banjo kazooie are all pretty much essential
THE POINT IS THEY'RE DIFFERENT OKAY <:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:741919221214347276>
oh holy shit though
you know what i just made myself want to play? diddy kong racing
bide...
i did, i'm just still processing everything
my brain isn't fast enough to keep up with this nonsense
it'll happen to you someday
there it is
i was waiting for the other shoe to drop
arizona is still contested b3es, fox and AP have called it very early
it may actually go to biden but the voting is close and it's not sure where it'll actually go at this point
which puts fox and AP in a weird spot if nevada DOES go to biden, because then they'll basically be announcing biden as the winner
you have a lot to learn, "me"
lurk moar fool
we'll mold you into a fine litizen yet
now i need to go shoot myself in the face for saying that
9 PM
because they're fucking mondo stupid
```47,277 ballots are still outstanding in GEORGIA, per state elections official at Atlanta presser. Among them.

17k in Chatham (still scanning)

6k in Clayton

4K in Forsythe

7,305 in Fulton

4,800 in Gwinnett```
it's gonna be fucking razor thin either way
i really hate the subreddit sometimes
<@!205026834205769748> this is because you are a wiener
people shit on rural areas because of the people who live in rural areas
i live in a rural area and i love it, but i hate the people here
i sat on my porch yesterday for five minutes just to escape the election craze and there was no sound except the wind going through the trees
it was fucking amazing
i even took a picture of the view, let me see if i can be bothered to post that
maybe where you live moon
i think my aunt and mom who live here have given in to the qanon stuff
yes, and i _live_ in my area
what the fuck is your point
```can you at least tell me how is this low effort?``` i'm gonna shit blood
i don't give a shit whether or not they agree with "our platform" moon, i'm appraising these people based on what i've seen after living in this area for like 15 fucking years
<@!131650004606648320> the problem is that "being as effective" as fox news also requires duplicating a number of their strategies, which include warping things to the point of unreality or outright lying to their audience
no one with a semblance of morality or dignity wants to win under those circumstances, which means we don't pursue those strategies, which means we keep losing people to absurd propaganda and conspiracy theories
okay, what is your suggestion moon
how are we supposed to counteract this behemoth of misinformation
so what?
yes, but what are we supposed to do about it
i know that my extreme relatives literally believe abortion is murder, but what is the point of bringing that up
are we supposed to like... give in to that rhetoric
do we give them an inch
why on earth would they think that??
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i know, that's why it's <:howHigh:354512283038121984>
that's pretty fucking out there lat
i mean, full props to you for being consistent, but damn
this could be by like... mere hundreds of votes
nobody has the patience required to pull off literally any of what you described
what i'm saying is that your plan is unreasonable
it may be a path to victory, but you also know what a _different_ path to victory would be? completely killing everyone who opposes your viewpoint
we don't do that because it's also unreasonable
so this is starting to look like an intractable problem
she also tried to do it with the discord server too
also there's a policy against it, i don't know if there's any real punishment associated with it but subreddits are discouraged from placing people in charge of the properties as heads of communities too
leads to a conflict of interest
~~i could totally be talking out of my ass, this is information relayed to me by other people~~
anyway
is slander abusive? the new hot topic
i think the problem here is conflating the idea that "abuse" is automatically the worst thing possible in this scenario
i kind of agree with lat that kate accusing us of running a child porn ring is not really "abuse" but even so it was still a really fucking bad thing
like, there's a spectrum of severity in play here
i feel "harassment" is a more accurate descriptor
so we're in agreeance then
it fucking sucks no matter how you slice it
no
they were understandable
but they were not, in the end, justifiable
important difference
he handwaved a felonious accusation because of his familiarity with one side of the argument
and then demanded unreasonable things of the opposing party
like, i don't know what else to say about it
it makes sense from a certain perspective but it's still completely wack and dumb
things could have turned out a lot better but they actually turned out like shit
no one is happy about that
i would much rather be living in the timeline where we weren't in this situation, but things didn't pan out that way
gotta parry into legend someday
i can't wait for this to be over so we can go back to shitting on homestuck 2
it's a good show
uh
okay?
why
<@!168980988477702145> WHAT what WHAT what WHAT WHAT
lat i think you mean vociferous or vocal or osmething
ah, right, sorry
i thought virulent meant something to do with "potent" for some reason
and yes it does tera, but it specifically relates to the contagion's destructiveness
wow, and i thought liberals exaggerated hard
nost if that were to happen
i'm not the kind of guy who says "i told you so"
but
it would be hard not to in a situation like that
i didn't catch a link, someone hit me up
also apparently greta thunberg was dunking on trump
```GretaThunberg
So ridiculous. Donald must work on his Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Donald, Chill!
```
greta has more spirit and fire in her than i ever will
um
what?
i wonder what kind of mindset it takes to be able to say things this blatantly false without flinching
why the fuck is he talking about this
saying he won pennsylvania again
trump is spewing about all of the things they won and whinging about all the stuff they didn't win, claiming that everything they DID lose is because of external interference
DID
DID HE SAY GEORGIA IS RUN BY DEMOCRATS
he's stumbling hard
BINOCULARS

some reporter just said "Are you being a sore loser?"
i'm fucking losing my shit
i want that guy's fucking name, he is a hero
have you ever asked the president of the united states of america, _to his face_, whether he's a sore loser
i can't believe i'm fucking getting excited over this
i can't wait for misha to post monkeyflip again
no, he's a fucking loser
yeah andrew
hell no, the speech was him bloviating about how the election is being stolen from him by "corruption" in the form of mail-in ballots
i fucking love it
is there a livestream of those proceedings? that would be WAY better
it's like smoking crack, i need the next hit

with every vote that draws us closer to a monkeyflip, i can feel every atom in my body vibrating just a little more quickly
biden has multiple paths to victory here
trump needs to win most/all of these states in order to win though
<@!131650004606648320>
facilities is correct here
i mean, faculty is also correct
the point is you're being pedantic and you're not even completely right you DINGUS
YOU BUFFOON
shaka?
the monkey is eternal
a shit lasts only a while
magistrate, sometimes i wonder what you must think of all this
i have a lot of respect for you as a writer and you don't spend _that_ much time here
no, this channel
fair enough
enough waxing pensive about our culture from me, MONKEY FLIP INCOMING
oh yeah i forgot about that
FLIP FLIP FLIP flip... flip? where flip? come on flip, we're waiting
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
jesus ben
put it back in your pants, would you
i like that he labeled the clock as "wee hours"
that's such a fucking stupid and minor detail
i mean, there's the "disclaimer" at the bottom of that snapshot of q
it's either some dude trolling or they just didn't notice the disclaimer and took it as legit
i hate you for making me laugh at "trump sharted too hard"
like, he didn't even get hurt or die, he just shat his pants so bad that they cut him out of the election process
bweeeee
yes, there's talk of the red wave crashing in arizona
as much as we shit on nevada, at least it's not north carolina
which has declared it won't count anymore votes until next _week_

no woonjail
Often used word in politics!
the examples of hypocrisy go back like a decade and are endless
jeff bezos shoved them into his fat ass
fucking edging us all day
i'm tired of it
<a:aTereziFlipping:393671882442014721>
i know, it was viscerally terrifying
what a thrill
Get out, dude. You're fired.
<:ResidentSleeper:240720478925225984>
he has a point though i'm getting fucking bored because these people take longer than my dead grandma to count ballots
<@!146014279529791488> let's play dark souls or something
i don't give a shit kosh i just want it to be over
you thought i was fucking joking?
lat, you are like little baby
watch this:
<:kek:230307022598438912>
yeah i saw it misha
quality shit
that really went out the window with the advent of DLC, didn't it
you'll miss the flip
sad!
but fair
GUYS
HOLY SHIT
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
has anyone brought up the fact that putin is resigning
what a mindfuck
wait a minute
this is The Sun in the UK
yeah nevermind
<:eyes_fast:417208120859951105>
i plan on getting a handgun at some point, dero and i went to the shooting range once a couple months ago and that helped me to get over my fear of handling them
i've shot guns before but they were all like toy stuff
i was speaking figuratively, shut up
i know they aren't actually toys
but they are not guns sold in a gun store
fuck OFF
i don't give a shit about your careful pedantry
i know the difference, do not patronize me
anyway
when we went to the range i tried two pistols and a revolver
a few weeks ago dero brought over her shotgun and we shot a few rounds from that
no, i was a bit taken with the revolver so i don't recall the types
<@!146014279529791488> do you recall what we tried at the range
yeah, and i understand the danger of a firearm and i shouldn't have referred to a BB gun or a .22 as a  "toy gun," now squarely fuck off with this before i shove it up your ass
b3es demodded
<a:wackiest:393686215502594048>
but nah here you go
shut up
anyway, i didn't like the shotgun at first but i think it's grown on me
i don't much care for pistols though, the act of reloading the magazines was very frustrating compared to just dumping the revolver cartridges and replacing them
fucking awful
PA vote margin down to 24,000
SAY THE LINE
so what is charlie kirk's deal anyway
why does literally anyone know who he is
i have to admit the schadenfreude is a little impressive
i would much prefer that we weren't in this spot though, where there seems to be one section of the populace fucking furious at the other all the time
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132> what
that sounds ridiculous
.... are we sure??????
that they did this to own the libs?
this sounds like a thinly veiled fetish concept
oh my god
that makes me uncomfortable
our monkey flips have been denied until tomorrow
what a fucking joke
between 1-3 AM EST i believe
they're on the last season ever
i dunno, i don't watch supernatural
ehh
full story might be enough
i was JUST looking at the steam page for it today and decided to download the update
but have they said what specifically is still missing from the game
is it just small tweaks or is there major content they still want to add
```Decision Desk HQ has Trump‚Äôs lead down to 1,479 votes in Georgia based on what I‚Äôm assuming is another small batch of returns from Clayton County.```
sigh
i should probably just ignore this shit and go to bed
<@!146014279529791488> are we playing again tonight or are you a stupid wiener who's going to bed
DIE DIE DIE DIE
piece of shit being an infamous county in the southwest of the british isles
pretty sure the part makin is focusing on is the very temporary nature of it
you're right that this is all technically legal but it doesn't feel very in the spirit of residency
no it's not
this just in, makin supports tyranny
wait, what am i talking about
makin has been a tyrant since day one
what the fuck how did i not notice the 1.1 collection announcement
two days ago? holy shit
KGTAC has a lot of emote bait
HAMBERGER
i'm going to avoid those channels then, i don't wanna get spoiled üò¶
fuck you bepis
nah, there are other news sources reporting on it
hm
someone posted a link from a new york paper of osme kind, but i'm not seeing any major news outlets saying anything
so maybe you're right, this seems a bit like bunk for now
wait, is it your birthday today tipsy
happy day of your birth
resuming my read through of homestuck with the collection
```TT: John, are you ok?
TT: You seem a bit tentative.
EB: i'm fine i guess.
EB: since i got here i feel compelled to do these weird things i don't really want to do.
EB: by some kind of voice that i can't really even hear. i don't know, it is hard to explain.
TT: Perhaps the early symptoms of an anxiety disorder, like post-traumatic stress?
EB: yeah, maybe. who knows!
TT: Well, if you can pull yourself together, there are a few more things we should try.
TT: Like prototyping the Kernelsprite again, if possible.
TT: We should hurry. My laptop battery won't last forever.
EB: Ok. I will go back inside.```
this got more done than like 25 pages of homestuck 2
i didn't realize jesus christ was a software developer named "wilkolicious"
```And the son of God, savior of mankind, walked into the temple where Twitch streamers had their audience subjected to multiple stream ads over the course of each hour. Wilkolicious then said, "What the fresh fuck is THIS? Oh hell no, I'm not putting up with all these shitfuck ads." And then he began to overturn the tables and made a new project on Github.```
kosh extra tilted tonight
not the best turnaround but better than nothing
wow, you're giving me fucking whiplash
you never did expound on that by the way
and until you do, i'm just going to ignore it
watch it kosh
hey cuil
hoping to go to bed soon
oh man
this is bad
oh boy
i'm gonna say it in a full sentence otherwise it may come back to haunt me through linkybot one day
the conservative fear-mongering slogan chart has given me: `If Joe Biden wins, transgenders will touch babies.`
i told you it was not good
... oh, OH
no, sorry, i had it wrong
it's `If Joe Biden wins, transgenders will touch my religion.`
mega late, but based enough that i'll allow it
cuil is viewing your questions as a rebuff, and has assumed that their own question was an invasion of your privacy
no flip yet but the margin is less than 500 votes
no, trump is still in the lead in georgia
biden is projected to overtake him
"THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!"
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
sad i missed the fleeps but good enough scrolling through backlog
i both do and don't enjoy the copium memes
on the one hand, the sheer level of delusion is unreal and it's hard not to want to make fun of it
on the other hand, we're gonna have to put up with the consequences of these people being so utterly divorced from reality
it's a bit weird misha, because florida voted for a pretty progressive policy (15 bucks minimum wage) while also rejecting biden
democrats also lost a shit ton of down ticket races
it feels like things are moving kind of sideways
it's been like less than a week
i gotta get ready to leave in a bit soonish but i want the memes to be poured directly into my veins
uh
is toby okay
i mean, that's the fucked dup part though
is that without jo spoilering trump's votes, we would probably be looking at a trump presidency right now
or wait
how does this work out with PA in the mix
oh man, you're right nik
what is jeff gonna do now that orange man bad is out of office
the dude has virtually made a living off of pointing out trump's inadequacies and fuckups
i have to admit, the whinging from trump supporters about democrats being "poor winners" is pissing me off to an inordinate degree
hypocrisy, man
unapologetic hypocrisy no less
it is... and yet it feels wrong
both GA and PA
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1324730186798161925?s=20
i hope you're all ready for trump losing his fucking mind today
i unironically fear the possibility that he'll initiate some kind of offense
against whom i'm not sure
i think he's implying that trump will retake georgia and pennsylvania while biden has no chance of taking arizona??
either way it's clearly unhinged
can we get a wellness check on charlie kirk
apparently rush limbaugh said biden won but then trump supporters went apeshit on him so he took it back
<:SHIALABEOUF:532559243270946816>
THERE'S BLOOD _EVERYWHERE_
RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE _from shia labeouf_
guess i'll bite the bullet and go check 4chan out again, it's been a while
all as it should be
alternative realities tm

let's all agree to refer to them as "lizoids" from now on

bernie is probably too old to run again in 2024
i mean, he's legally allowed to, but he's probably fucking tired
you know, i had totally forgotten why i used to get enjoyment out of 4chan threads
it's not only way more conducive to reaction images, which is 90% of the deal there, but everything there is just way more stark in general
0 punches pulled
it's kind of shocking, in a way that is variously terrible and sometimes funny
yeah i got bored of 4chan again real quick
i don't have the energy to sift through all the shit for the diamonds
same
i find the "leftie takeover" threads funny though
"REJECT DYSPHORIA
OBTAIN ESTROGEN"
pretty amusing, i wonder if we'll see a shift in that direction
probably not for long, if at all
yeah
i should probably try watching made in abyss as well
i tried to hop in stream but it was already a bit along so i missed whatever had happened at first
was totally lost
well, it's like
actually, i don't really know, it's been a long time since i regularly used the website
i just remember that it used to be based a lot in counterculture, so if any one viewpoint became too prevalent or dominant it would start getting assblasted from the opposite side
eventually it seemed to settle into right-leaning or even alt-right culture pretty hard without that counterculture really popping up
now it feels like the bubble has finally popped a bit
but again, i don't really know, i haven't used the site regularly in ages
4chan is the kind of space where those uh
what are they called, crude leftists?
that would be the kind of space they congregate in, if it werent for the fact that it's anonymous and 4chan hasn't been relevant in ages
dirtbag leftists, thank you
dirtbag left is just liberals and progressives that have no compunction against using offensive language and fighting dirty
yeah, i don't think 4chan is on the scopes of many, if _any_, leftist groups looking for a place to call their own
like i said, 4chan hasn't really been relevant for ages
although, the qanon stuff may prove otherwise
of all the things to come out of 4chan since the aughts, fucking qanon conspiracy
i don't even think that's really been true zent
you can argue that stuff like peepo and wojak are still relevant insomuch as they're used in places like this
but for a long time i don't think there's been real Original Content coming out of 4chan and going into other places
most internet content now is recycled text posts going between reddit, twitter, instagram, etc
yeah, after thinking about all this, i definitely am not giving 4chan enough credit
totally forgot about brrrrr
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
i see a lot of economic doomer posts about biden winning and making the economy tank
interestingly though i'm looking at some of the index funds and they've actually been going up with the certainty of joe biden's victory

you're kind of shit out of luck then
lat is very anti-capitalist
oh, man
i was actually looking at a crackshack in town that was small enough that it seemed like it could be a fixer upper
it was only 15,000 so i figured the mortgage would be easy to keep up with but if they expect it up front that's not possible
benis
HOWEVER 7 billion points for gryffindor
yeah, if you have reliable and cheap/free housing you're basically miles ahead of everyone else already
i have just now secured that, but the problem is that we live in bum fuck nowhere so the minimum wage is bad, and i still need to find a job in the first place
you know what's fucked up? when i was looking for housing in undergrad and grad school, studio apartments often costed the same or MORE than one/two bedroom apartments
i don't know mint, although i did stay in one place that was fucking wretched and it was only 300 bucks a month
that was the apartment that was so small that i had to shuffle to get into the bathroom
studio apartments are _specifically designed_ to be efficient in size and arrangement, why the fuck would they cost more than a full sized apartment
i need to buy some cheap land and build a house on it
like a barebones shack
then i can languish in peace
i actually am fine with taxes, i'm not some kind of dumb fuck libertarian
why would i not just build a shelter underground
that is the more reliable and safer option
mobile homes are kind of hard to live in, unless you mean like the full sized ones
in which case those are literally just houses
i used to use a singlewide mobile home as my bedroom for a year when i was in high school, and it was kind of cozy
hickland as fuck but cozy
yes, people do that often here
it's always interesting seeing what's essentially an entire house shorn in half and transported on the highway
they're legally referred to as "manufactured homes"
every house is like over 1,000-1,500 square feet
i swear, it's just indulgent
i could get away with like 500 square feet or less
i HAVE lived in places like that without too much issue
too bad even smaller housing is fucking expensive
yep, everyone's waiting for part 69
with bated breath
there it is
i'm solidifying my place in history, see you fucking virgins later
stone that man
i don't understand, why are bundles functionally different from any old inventory spot
making me want to play again
stop it
how long does it usually take from snapshots to full release
ugh
fuck
i don't want to wait that long but i also don't want to play before full release
oddly though now _i'm_ curious, what's yours woc
fair enough, me neither
i never got really into benchpressing when i was lifting weights either
i mostly did curling
that's a solid goal for benching, yeah
you do dumbbells or a barbell?
what's your curl weight
god, i need to dig my dumbbells out of my car trunk
at my best i was curling 40-45 lbs dumbbells
i had poor form and it hurt my arms though, didn't get that sorted out until i was basically moving out of virginia
i would get the barbell out too but i don't actually have a bench for it here
nice, lmao
it'd be worth the candle if wales could actually finish writing this batch
+pogress
come ON
legit going 3 months between updates at this point
killing me
oh shit
yeah, that's fucking weird
that's pretty coolio
posts like that are why i've had to gradually abandon participating in discourse on those topics
you get a bunch of unfiltered crazies that twist things and transform it into this fucked up, hostile rhetoric
rather than being about seeking equity and the removal of social barriers, it becomes about affirming social barriers that are in support of their viewpoint
it's extremely disturbing and i don't have the heart to participate in it
"""joked"""
OH BOY
<@!191265659936702464> imagine being such a beta that you're afraid of comparing chins with the homies
lat never claimed it was based in logic
or at least not sensible logic
it's just a natural effect of dealing with people like that and then trying to rationalize it, poorly
<@!184545248930693120> settle down, there's really only two
maybe more, i didn't scroll that far back
either way you don't have a monopoly on the discussion
it'll be nice to go back to not caring about politics OOPS WAIT nevermind that's not happening
i was literally thinking about him just today actually
do you think bill watterson is happy these days
nah he's still alive
just extremely quiet
true to his ethos
i didn't know they had a collab but that immediately sounds awful
sorry cy, venting is hard to do in this channel
we're all about hard intervention and examination
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
that fucking twitter thread <:eddy:659154159169306644>
I'M A GAY LIBERAL _COMMUNIST_ and then you vomit pea soup like in the exorcist
based on the words "trump" and "fanfic" i can already tell i don't want to engage in this
you said that like it was reassuring, but it just made my grimace worse
it's like that thing redditors post every day
G Gaslight
O Obstruct
P Project <- he is here
<:huskHusky:663743008939704321>
imagine being this wrapped up in a conspiracy
fumbling for literally any detail that could support your ideas
trying as hard as you can to avoid reckoning with the cognitive dissonance
it's almost like being a homestuck fan
i was expecting the race to get called by now
this is no longer fun, i just want it to be over
let us move on, please
it's because fox and AP put us in this fucking ridiculous gridlock with arizona
among other things
i'll believe it when i see it
nah, putnam has found a real job
needs more spice
<:HowHigh:272752191595610132>
NOW, OF ALL MOMENTS
"BIDEN'S DONE IT, HE JUST PULLED AHEAD BY THE REQUIRED MARGIN IN PA, MAKING HIM THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE U--"
"i concede"
then everyone collectively shits their pants and dies
don't ping me u fat nasty trash
how on earth is this better, what the fuck
that mustache needs more curling and he needs to be turned into a pickel
that's better
i  honestly don't see the point in nuclear anymore misha
it takes forever to get the infrastructure up and by the time we develop a bunch more nuclear plants to meet energy demands, renewable energy like solar, wind, and hydroelectric will have continuously been cheapening to the point that nuclear is just nonfeasible
we're already pretty much there anyway
it has been cheapening for decades and is even more economical than coal/gas now
but whatever, don't let me get in the way of your ranting
in my ass
yeah no biden got speech therapy for it when he was growing up
his stutter was _bad_
indeed
i have to wonder if he's actually approaching senility or if his seeming out of it was because of being out of the political game for a while
that too
i actually felt pleased to hear a speech from someone remotely connected to the office of the president for the first time in like four years
it was pretty empty but it was soothing
that's called being a bad person
i mean
let's be frank, biden is still not my first or second or third choice
i'm not 100% pleased that biden is what we ended up with
i'm more kind of like grimly accepting
yang?? hell no
yang would be a really weird and unconventional president
and i doubt he would have really pulled the nation together
MEME IN HELL
mcafee's never gonna consume his own penis is he
pussy
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
IT'S FLAT FUCK FRIDAY YOU FUCKIN' LOSERRRRRS
but uh
when was the last time missouri went blue, out of curiosity
sometimes a military helicopter will pass through
gotta love fun drivers
according to these nut jobs yes
still laughing at that meme whenever i see it in the corner of my eye
yeah, i really do hope we get to see that
icing on the election cake
no, i think trump actually said he will barricade himself in the white house if he loses
i wouldn't be surprised if he does this
oh
FAT HUSKY
makin ~probably~ doesn't live in the united states and he would never ever ever agree to meet with one of us irl, so we would probably just have to put him on voice call so he can use a voice synthesizer and/or big man tyrone clips
"Strange truth: it seems that a vast portion of President Trump's personal time throughout his administration was spent observing and coordinating an online chat group called 'Homestuck,' our investigators are currently..."
i would leave this server
why
no one wants that kind of attention
ever
you know what would happen if it did?
entire server would just start brapposting at him
yes
but also CAN YOU IMAGINE
the sheer idea of trump physically watching all of the hugh video
that idea is fucking blowing my mind
ranked on what
just general personal preference?
well, bowser from mario 1 can fuck right off
or king koopa as he's colloquially known
mario world bowser didn't really make any lasting impression
he's like a slightly worse version of mario bros 3 bowser
so i guess of the three listed--well in that case it's hardly a question, modern bowser takes the most influence from a mix of mario 3 and mario 64 bowsers
in visual design and manner
modern bowser is really well polished in most of his forms
i like galaxy bowser and paper mario bowser a lot
probably the most actually
shoutout to bowser's inside story bowser though definitely
god damn, canada was a wild time
that was the same trip as <:bred:684981349311971339>
why do you even have this image
not that i'm upset, i'm just curious how you found this
yeah no fucking shit
but in seriousness, explain
yeah, behind every minor incident in this server is a lengthy discussion in the modchat where people debate what to do for an extended period of time
this sounds snarky when i write it out like that but i'm being 100% serious
this happens in like 60-75% of all cases where we're even slightly divided on how to proceed
over multiple arguments no less
oh god, you guys don't want to know how long we have argued about the word "retard"
which i think we might FINALLY have put a rest to
NO
DO NOT
i swear to god i've spent more time debating the use of that word on this server than i have playing some video games that i _really like_
it's you and a couple others
probably tay included
i'm sure there's a couple other people in there who would agree, but the problem is that those of us who have been around for the discourse in the past are so fucking tired of it, and woc will personally rip our collective nuts off if we try to discuss the matter again
also i miss streaming
there are games i have wanted to stream
like deus ex
i fucking loved deus ex and that was the first time i ever played it
i am 100% certain my internet just physically can't handle it though
i could give it a test here during slow hours but i just don't think it'll come out to anything good
you only regret it because you got fucking assblasted for it later <:TenseiFace:243174946178596864>
that's fair
also it's part of why cyr got assblasted, it was like setting a precedent
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN
THAT YOUR ACTIONS
HAVE
_CONSEQUENCES_
to obviate furthering this discussion... tera, would you mind being a guinea pig for me to test streaming conditions and see if i can possibly pull this off
no idea, a mod probably misclicked earlier
could even have been me
me neither, but it's irrelevant
that is makin's domain and makin's domain alone
alright tera let me put up streamlabs and finagle some stuff
i doubt this is going to turn out well
<@!137125582994538496> dude, okay
you generated a lot of good will with the homestuck archives
so we're going to let you off with a warning
but you better never fucking jape us on a fat husky again
or else it's your _ass_
cuz it's not actually twice the dogs makin, it was just one dog being covered by a pillow or some other sick instrument of subterfuge
we were cheated and lied to
isn't that betraying the public's trust?
isn't that immoral?
`who was that guy?`
`i don't know. he must not be from around here!`
also tera i already feel like this test stream is going to go like ass
it apparently has its slew of performance issues
i'll take it though
unless there's someone else who wants it in which case give it to them
that number is more than one and i hate that you've made me aware of it
finally obs updated
okay, let me get this game up on screen
gonna try
it's gonna look like shit
if it works at all
oh boy
let's give THIS a shot
<https://www.twitch.tv/drewlinki>
yeah, terrible as expected
<@!186774984092418048> decided to abort stream because it was just that bad
there's seemingly some new internet provider in the area that might start servicing my location, which should be a lot better than what we have now
if that happens i'll probably try to start streaming again
until then it's donezo
https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trumps-ex-wife-once-said-he-kept-a-book-of-hitlers-speeches-by-his-bed-2015-8
```Trump then recalled, "Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of 'Mein Kampf,' and he's a Jew."

Brenner added that Davis did acknowledge that he gave Trump a book about Hitler.

"But it was 'My New Order,' Hitler's speeches, not 'Mein Kampf,'" Davis reportedly said. "I thought he would find it interesting. I am his friend, but I'm not Jewish."```

it's kind of like when bolas watched the room every fucking night for like a month
DADDY
do you even feel any enjoyment for that movie anymore?
like, why would you do that?
god
i'm so sorry
soon though, i don't know why not
soon being a relative measure, probably not this week
direct connections like that require a little finagling using the cmd prompt
i don't remember how to do it exactly but you can easily look it up
it's probably extra weird cuz of one being a raspberry pi
also i'm glad you had a good birthday tips
sorry, i was reading backlog
yeah i was asking nat about it because she's been helping me take care of the server as well
also i think the url you had was for a different server also hosted here
we have two
i have one, and i think... prime? or raar? someone here has the other
ours is a fluctis address
yeah there you go
that address might be old
i've had to repurchase server space because i didn't realize deactivation was a permanent thing and it retires the old address, for _some reason_
well, let me just go check the hosting service
oh right <:HowHigh:272752191595610132> this was back when we very briefly wanted to play hardcore mode and we did it like one night hardcorehomestuck.fluctis.net
no one cares about farscape
we want VIDEO GAMES
who do you think you are, rich evans
THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED BUT I LIKE THE RESULT SO I WON'T CALL IT RIGGED
PRETTY
PLEASE
can we at least prepare first
i also need to go out and take care of some stuff
make it for like in an hour
pls my children are starvink i need to get bred
we'll see when supreme leader makin says
that's been on like 80% of trump's tweets for like a week and a half

so when _do_ we start
<:monkaOMEGA:663106010344587279>
good thing i prepared for this
i assume it's better with more SCPs in play
with just one it's definitely kind of milquetoast
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<@!120187484863856640> F1X TH1S
we're still good to go for a few more rounds
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
BRING BACK THE GAME
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
FAT HUSKY
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
<:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
i wonder if i can like
download my TF2 files and drive them over to you in a flash drive
that would take infinitely less time
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
<@!146014279529791488> you wanna play dark souls instead
sorry you missed out on SCP
what did he even say at the conference
"I WON" several times?
24/24 players, sigh
bah
what a despicable human being
what are you talking about
yes, what about them
i already gave you the name of one that's up
yes i did <:howHigh:354512283038121984>

hardcorehomestuck.fluctis.net
you fucking wiener
let me get a screenshot from when we were doing homestuck ages ago, we still have those maps so it's not technically wrong
wait, hold on
i thought the server was perpetually up but it may have gone down at some point
the beastmc one is run by raar
DUDE
HOLD YOUR FUCKING PANTS
i'm trying to find a screenshot of our old server
it had a lot of good structures on it
dude, can you shut up for like five seconds
wait a minute and let me figure it out
the fluctis address i gave you is joinable, the server is just not _up_ right now
apparently nat has been using raar's server, which is the beastmc address
i'm launching the fluctis server and joining in a second
christ you are so
FUCKING
_WHINY_
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:741919221214347276>
god, i forgot just how fucking slow my internet is <:punctuation:305073440975486976>
it's literally taking like 20 minutes to redownload this version of minecraft
<@!120187484863856640> fuck it, we weren't planning on doing anything on the vanilla survival world until caves and cliffs update comes out
just don't include it, i'll let you know when we fix it up
it's 1.15.2
have fun with that
see you in sixteen hours
<@!156922195631669249> we need to get our ducks in a row because makin unexpectedly got his panties in a twist
<:annoyedCallie:422827427866083329>
i fucking hate you
sort of
makin is going to list all of the different games we do on his website so we don't need to do the subreddit sidebar anymore
i've still got my server going too, and i think having two differently purposed servers is best
what is yours for specifically
like, anarchy right
... creative or survival, which is it
okay
uh
in that case we can keep mine around for more specific stuff
<@!120187484863856640> how about you just make it so that if anyone wants, tell them to contact me with requests for what to do, like mods or hardcore mode since that's what we initially purposed it for
that's probably like addons or whatever they're called
plugins
i just wasn't expecting this today
i hate having shit sprung on me out of nowhere <:drewseethy:719621463753359461>
i'm sure the server is still up
probably pretty active too
that works perfectly
check the link makin posted
both of them are on there
discord's been pretty weird lately

yeah i want him to fucking talk already
i hate this pre-talk shit
someone @ me when they actually start the speech
damn lat
you've really matriculated into older internet culture since you started talking here
"no i haven't"
but yeah i haven't even sent goatse in like 10 years
what's a woman?
<@!111477124384202752> so you said you've been playing genshin impact
i have a few questions
mainly 1) how big is the world 2) how dependent are you on being able to fight to explore the world 3) is there actually _fun shit_ to explore
i basically meant "are you forced to be able to survive enemy encounters to be able to move around and explore stuff"
how grindy is it
i see
but you can generally get around without investing that much time
cool
can you actually explore everything you see or is it like lotro where mountains and shit are actually forbidden
i want to climb mountains, is my point
<:howHigh:354512283038121984>
i might check this out
even better actually

i've downloaded the launcher but it's acting weird

yep, that fixed it
mmmm, borger

he dies before taking office
i wonder how expensive those masks are
he definitely sounds... better than he did earlier this year

i want there to be considerable feedback
OBAMA... TWO!
take a shot every time he says folks
down the bottle with malarkey
also yeah i'm cynical too but it feels good to actually hear someone who is capable of using the english language
are you actually watching the video right now umbra
i'll give you an example of a trump speech in a bit
"NOTHING WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO DO" except for like... national healthcare
<@!542086093776879616> now i'm cheating a little bit, but here's trump during some speech, a debate or rally https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elhyo-_fR0E
this is about the average caliber of his talks
anyone with even a single iota of attentiveness and rational thinking looks at stuff like this and is just baffled by it
do you see why so many of us were upset for the last four years
it would be one thing if it WAS just an inactive lazy fat 15 year old
but that was the president of the united states
i was going to say, that's probably cuz they were written by a different person
https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ed9n5o/i_wont_be_reading_et_again_trump_attacks/fbglage/?context=3
this is a reddit comment from earlier this year
it provides a plausible explanation for why trump sucks at speeches
i mena
most of us begrudge being this in-tune with our politics
we kind of hate it
but not caring also leads to people like trump being able to gather large support
so it's better to stay informed, yeah
i'm definitely going to keep up reading political articles in the future, doesn't matter that trump's out
i know right tori
as it was originally envisioned, the president should more often be kind of symbolic than anything that actually impacts our daily lives
in an ideal scenario we probably wouldn't have to think about him too much
but it's still relieving to know that trump's gonna be out of office in january
i actually feel motivated to get my job search back up and going on monday
like, "damn, i can breathe again"
i know the president is the commander of the armed forces, i was more saying that ideally that doesn't matter much because we're not supposed to constantly be at war
unfortunately we _are_ so it's a relevant detail
in times of peace though, that probably wouldn't amount to much
army would mostly be relegated to peace-keeping or relief missions like for natural disasters
yeah, isn't it nice to have someone in office who actually understands the basic duties of being an elected official, and crucial details like how our government is supposed to function???
it's much better than someone who hamfistedly tries to establish cronies and suckups who will give him anything he wants
i have a feeling it's time to return to east asia
probably china or one of the countries it bullies
i think elon musk is a nasty piece of shit but leave him alone until he gets the infrastructure established to actually take us to other planets, thanks
i was going to say, another thing i'm looking forward to, hopefully, is the repudiation of complete nutjobs like alex jones
i fucking hate alex jones's guts
he is a miserable human being who needs to be kept away from the pbulic at all costs
same for like, rush limbaugh
and everyone on fox news
the only alex jones adjacent content i have ever liked in my entire life https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByJgRrMvd2g
nah, he just stuttered once or twice
hell, just the one time from what i can recall
what the fuck am i listening to
this makes me want to listen to dethklok
why on earth would they??
it's not fucking earth
it's mars
they would probably have their own unique set of laws
FUCK YOU KOSH i knew you were going to do it
i knew it as soon as i said it
<:ree:475542526791516170>
god
if elon musk ever puts out a call like
"if you want a one way ticket to mars for free, now's the time"
i will take it in a heartbeat
i love you all but i belong somewhere else than here
nope, there's a metric shit ton of people who say "i can't imagine leaving the earth"
let's be martian bunkmates kosh
the idea of exploring and documenting stuff in space fills me with such unbelievable joy
it is one of my fondest pipe dreams
you fuckin said it
i mean, could they not see ships coming from far away on the ocean
i don't actually know the specifics of this
OBVIOUSLY
I'M NOT A FUCKING WIENER
i'm just saying in general, there was a minimum distance of visibility
hm
no
i live in the middle of the country
do you need a reminder of where i am
i'm literally
in the middle
of the continent
there are no lakes big enough around here for that
god i just
i think i would be able to die happy if even just one time, i was able to go into orbit around the earth
or even just shoot out of the earth's atmosphere

the challenge is to make a nice dinner and enjoy your evenings
i'm drinking, and the gods cannot stop me
i'm finishing off some american honey i've had in the fridge for a while
it's definitely not the best drink, but it's very efficient
it's a kind of whiskey made by the brand wild turkey
it's extremely, sickeningly sweet
so i tend to cut it with water and just drink it like that
there's no telling how i'll be in like... an hour
you impress those lesbians dude
jam that whiskey STRAIGHT UP

wow, going back and looking at the tourette's guy is such a punch in the balls y time
that shit is 15 years old
at least you can admit defeat gracefully
yeah, that's why i only bet 10 bucks
if i had bet more and lost, i would be fucking insane with anger
send it to the organ donor society or whatever it's called
that's much better idea
<@!133121291833049090> oh, BOB SAGET
i just watched a "best of tourettes guy" video and it was fucking surreal
internet humor has evolved a lot in the last two decades
i'm trying
oh man
i used to look at a fucking _website_ dedicated specifically to chuck norris memes
and i laughed at them
i also used to look at a website for out of context text messages between people
that was like the funniest shit when i was in 8th grade
nah it was called texts from last night
wow nik
against all possible odds, that made me laugh
i congratulate you
<@!168980988477702145> FRAGMENTS OR SOMETHING?

that's a pretty good meme though kosh, to be fair
like, i saw it used hundreds of millions of times, literally
no exaggeration at all
this roblox video is fucking blowing my mind
i keep expecting it to cut to something else but no, this is the entire thing
some dude mic spamming
the audio clipping is like so bizarre and otherworldly that it's still entertaining
you know that dero and i's sister plays roblox on like a fairly regular basis?? i wonder what she'd think if i sent her this
WHALE

yeah i have two siblings
i'm the eldest, dero is the middle, and we have a younger sister

yeah by that point all of your tastebuds have been killed off so you can't even tell
wow, you pissed off nik so hard that his venezuelan came out
holy shit i forgot he was in parks and rec
that's kind of weird
yeah
now compare that to how biden looks today
he doesn't seem bad but he's definitely like, on the way out
he's in the last so many years of his life
that's gonna happen to all of us
how does that make you feel
yes
well, how many years have passed between that picture and now
and now he is a fucking loony
compare that with

i would probably have never heard of alex jones if not for sandy hook
the fact that he's trying to claim it's a hoax makes me so fucking mad
he says it's a character that he plays when he's in court
that's as much as i know
i mean, whatever it is
you probably shouldn't base your media content on calling an elementary school shooting faked for political expediency
he calls himself _retarded_
it's not humanizing enough
god, still makes me upset
joe rogan is complex, he seems like a genuinely good investigator sometimes and then other times he's up his own ass about shit that makes no sense or is blatantly wrong
someone on his subreddit once said that joe rogan has "fallen out of touch" with the average american and i wouldn't be surprised if that's true
nah
it just depends on the episode
i don't care for a majority of his content but a few of his interviews have actually been decently interesting
just watch his interview with bernie sanders, that should alleviate some of your hatred
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O-iLk1G_ng
for anyone who hasn't seen it
he may not have acknowledged them but near the end of the race he definitely tried to bypass them
he tried to publish a tweet through white house media or something
i forget the details
but he wanted to avoid being censored
truly a new milestone in this election

so how does the healing even work with barbara/noelle
like, does it heal your own party members or is it purely a co-op thing
i'm gonna wait until dero finishes downloading the game to continue playing
holy _shit_
i missed some serious discourse an hour ago

the retcon mechanics work on the level of "there is no consequence for this"
this is explicitly stated
dave's time travel stuff is sanctioned by paradox space and subject to its rules and whims
john's retcon stuff is not, he can do literally whatever he wants at any time and permanently alter stuff
that's kind of why it's dumb

it's just
fucking impossible to find japanese dubbed versions of the 0079 compilation movies
i can stomach that, but this dude just said "CALLING THEMSELVES THE INDEPENDENT DUCHY OF ZEON"
i actually, physically grimaced when i heard it
gundam is so fucking sad
generally though i find i'm not minding the dub
bright's accent is delightful
also the scene where they salute ryu and the other fallen heroes was tearjerking
like, god damn
the kids saluting and everything
this show is just rife with the sorrow and devastation of war
no u
i certainly gawk
it's kind of an uncomfortable piece of literature
mein ever17
the world is always changing, but i think that it changes too fast for some people
hell, i like to think of myself as being fairly accepting or patient with people, but a lot of the shit i see is just too much
it makes it hard to accept things at face value when the discourse around things like gender identity changes so quickly that it doesn't even resemble itself from one year to the next
i can see why some people would be freaked out about this  and do a 180 on supporting it, even if that's not what i would find acceptable
i try my best to understand it but
look
today i was told about some kind of gender wiki
and they had an entry for "animesexual"
it was precisely what it sounds like
uh, what
yeah, what tm said
the point i'm trying to make is that there's an absurd amount of _stuff_ that is constantly changing, to the point that almost no one can feel assed to keep up
and then when you actually give a critical eye to it, half of it seems like a joke
there's a spectrum of gender identity called "celestial" or something where people identify as various planets
that kind of thing screams "absurdity" to me but, no, it's pushed as being completely serious
i think that, whatever the validity of such things may be, it will only ever be relevant to a bare handful of people
i don't consider stuff like the celestialgender example i used before to be "harmful" so much as it's like
well, i don't know
on some level i think it might be harmful, but not to other people
i guess it's like
i'm concerned with what things _mean_
i'm going to continue with the celestialgender example because i feel like it approaches a middleground of not being TOO cartoonish while also being clearly apart from the more accepted set of gender identities
what does it mean to be a celestialgendered person, ie "mercurygender" or whatever
i know what the fuck mercury the planet is but how the hell do you translate that into a personal identity
how the hell does it approach anything that's even remotely meaningful or worthwhile thne
that just smacks of nonsense to me
"i identify as joviangender" okay, what does that even fucking mean and why
no, i guess what i want to say in using this example is that i don't think couching this stuff in terms of gender makes it magically fine with no questions asked
if you met someone who genuinely and unironically believed they were the personification of zeus i would probably be worried about them
identifying as some kind of planet gender is like... in that realm for me, of thought processes that make no sense and are somewhat concerning
am i making any sense
it's not that i think they're going to hurt me or even themselves, but i just don't get it and i can't stop myself from thinking about the implications of it
i don't know about that tay?
i actually kind of like being able to ascribe proper meaning to things
pushing the concept of gender into complete disuse by force doesn't strike me as worthwhile
i guess here's my problem with this
what's being suggested here is that gender as a system can be tossed out the window, right
and that people should be allowed to describe themselves as whatever they want
alright sure
so
let's go with the classical separation between sex and gender so that we can put male and female (i am not going to include the complexity of intersex debate here) elsewhere
and so
you're left with describing people based on their individual behaviors
so historically, you have masculine and feminine
and when you say those two words, various characteristics immediately spring to mind
that's all well and good
now you can say "i don't identify as either of those things" or "i identify as a mix of both"
that's fine, we're still working in a realm of identifiability that makes some sense and has context
tipsy i'm not sure how sarcastic you're being
the point i'm trying to make is that that's going to be literally impossible
so instead of
making up an individual word for every single gender a person could possibly identify as, why don't we just describe ourselves with the personality traits that fit us
instead of saying i identify as some x-gender that literally no one else will understand the meaning of, why wouldn't i just describe myself by the personality traits i feel are true of myself, or that other people tell me about
it's like cutting out the middle man
my problem with that is that it's extra bullshit
it's fine to say that gender can be used to describe yourself and doesn't have to be defined on any axiom or reality in general, it's just whatever you want it to be
but the thing is you're going to be using this word--something that is custom-tailored to you--to describe yourself
so
if everyone is able to craft a word for themselves
but no one else knows what that word means
you still need to help them understand
and you need to use descriptions for that
shut the fuck up cy
i know the example you're referring to and i don't want to deal with your nonsense
no, be quiet
here's the thing though
not everyone wants to engage with that fuzzy language, because regardless of whether someone is able to come up with a concrete, unassailable definition for a chair, people are able to know what the fuck you mean when you say the word chair
i don't enjoy the idea of having to field this kind of thing forever based on every single person i meet
i would much rather not have to deal with it at all, and that's why i don't like the idea of having a custom word for everyone based on a whim
why the fuck are we bothering to use pronouns if we don't need to bother understanding them either????
it's fucking nonsense
tm i try my best to say "well sure" but as time goes by i can't help but have this underside of "whatever" underneath it
the more that gender discourse develops over time the less i understand it and the more complicated it seems to get
i wouldn't mind the complication if i didn't really need to deal with it, but we're having this discussion right now and i'm kind of being told that i need to just deal with it regardless
at a certain point the unwieldiness of the system becomes a problem, and is more aggravating to people in general than it is appeasing to those who use it
i hate gender politics
i'm going back to gundam where things can be talked about in a solid and meaningful manner
i am not interested in trying to participate in a not-system where the only rule is that there are no rules
revolutionaries are not ALL idiots, it depends on the exact scenario in question
my last comment on this: i have to seriously wonder where gender discourse is going in the grand scheme of things
i am not fully convinced that anyone will care 10-15 years from now
no, tm, i don't mean that gender will have been discarded
i mean that i think all of this discourse will have been forgotten and we'll have moved back to kind of how things were like before
i'm pretty sure the vast majority of people don't give a shit about this right now even
if i had to guess, pretty sure that these discussions are only relevant to like 1% of 1% of the population, if even that
<@!195290352838508544> you fucking moron
the periodic table of elements and gender identity are not even vaguely related
your analogy is horrible
also you're not even right, most people don't give a shit about anything past uranium except for like actual chemists and chemical engineers
continuing with this horribly misplaced metaphor
you both suck at arguing
too bad for you that my life is ending tonight as a result of this horrible, horrible conversation
yeah tipsy i have no idea what i would do if that happ--
alright i'm back from the dead to tell y'all to shut the fuck up about pronouns
yeah he passed an executive order that reclassifies people in his administration and lets him do that without issue
the real question is, who is chris miller and why did trump put him in the position
uh
i have no idea what this is
sorry, nothing
well how stupid can you get, really
probably has been attacked for ages and the information is already taken
mastodon: twitter with extra steps
he's probably antifa
i don't have the "a toast" emotes
this is a fucking shame
SUNDAY

so does anyone here fuffregno
you fucked that quote up hard
it's
do you know how humiliating it is... to have a SON
i'll sue you for everything, tera
including your mom
funny you should ask qweq



check out that account's posting history and that's literally all there is to know about math blaster
bwee
NOBODY DENIES ME ACCESS AND GETS AWAY WITH IT
i wish i could delete that "valid" emote, every time bolas uses it i want to shit blood
not really, mind, i just feel that it's overused at this point
i feel precisely the same way about "valid" as i do about "wig!" at this point
YES
he likely got paid millions of dollars because he didn't want to be in the movie and they had to entice him to do it with a percent rate
he has enough clout for that
when has that ever stopped anyone from trying to make more money
i'm not gonna lie, when qweq said "nazi wizard" earlier i was pretty sure she was talking about like a sith lord in star wars, so when nik launched into that synopsis i was fucking _confused_
"this metaphor is increasingly obtuse, what the hell is going on"
nope
gotta milk it
gotta squeeze that corpse for all it's worth
could you imagine if it comes out and it fucking sucks though?
20 years for all that?
thanks grrm
jeggrey
it definitely qualifies as /r/ThatHappened material
and then he waddled away
i was like
"excuse me"
but why do you say this
YOU OWE ME
<:ree:475542526791516170>
wow yeah, that's perfect
bring the numerals on
fucking nerd
lmao, it's been on this whole time
cryptic
holy shit
god, not a good evening for linkybot
might need to take 'em back out behind the shed
IT MUST BE
STOP TALKING ABOUT HOMESTUCK 2 DRAMA
it was a message i was advised to delete by tera cuz "lesbo" is seen as a pejorative term by some people
truer words were never said
either or
TETRA
OH NO
shut up himbo
hm
i wonder if it's finally time for me to try and get back into writing eloze
i wanted to prepare by playing everything i can again
too bad i can't stream anything, it'd be fun to try and do zelda 1 and zelda 2 again in front of people
maybe i'll hold off for better internet
i bet you do asshole
YOU'RE TOO LATE MUFUCKA
nah
i still need to play that actually, thanks for the reminder
not all theaters are built the same, for sure
different companies will have different preferred equipment
local theaters are of course the most hit and miss
also i feel good, i just managed to catch up on stats
eight solid days where i just sat on my ass and didn't record any fucking numbers
the difference between this year and last year is quite extreme though
one month's worth of data across the last four years
for comparison's sake we've already exceeded the message count from last year and we still have two months to go in the year

it's possible that we'll never reach 2017 levels of activity again
also no not yet 1011
i can do that if you'd like
what would you like to see
just the data for this year so far
it's habbeding, i got my weights out of the car and exercised yesterday
starting off low and slow, last time i got into lifting weights i kept increasing my weights too quickly
but i'm gonna get FIT again, mark my words
sure thing 1011
i'll do it after i'm done playing dark souls with dero
remind me if i forget
i've done a lot of thinking about that
it's complicated
will explain later
we have no real way of checking which people have the most messages
we can make educated guesses of course
but in order to empirically know, we'd have to search every user in the server and see how many messages they have
the top two are probably makin and myself, and then after that it becomes murkier
by now there's at least a dozen to two dozen (or even more) individuals with over 100,000 messages
altgen's community has cycled out too much for any one person to have accumulated that many messages
there are still some people from way back when the server was started, but they don't post that often
i want that nat
i want a list of the most active users in this server
and a top 100 list of most active users
MAKE IT HAPPEN
MAKE IT HAPPEN NOOOOOOOOOOOOW
what exactly is the bottleneck
no, i mean
what makes it take so long when you look through discord's archive
is it really just that the API is bad and doesn't function properly?? or is there like computing speed in question
... why would they do that???
so this is just
something that is completely right and i'm being unreasonable
also i don't need to estimate how many messages are on this server

hangout accounts for 815k messages
okay
<:meenUgh:528364914725879818>
i miss having microsoft office
openoffice is a fine program for free but it is not very stable and can't handle large quantities of numbers
i fucking hate that they switched to a subscription based format
make it a random chance for any command to just post that message instead
<@!249134046846779398> yeah, i literally can't turn this information into a graph because openoffice's excel ripoff can't handle large volumes of data
i can give you the spreadsheet if you'd like to play around with it though
i mainly want two graphs
first is a simple line chart with each day of the server's history and the messages sent on the
second is a line chart, but with each year overlapping on top of each other
here's the full spreadsheet i have for this year's data

the info you want is in the "message counts daily" tab
i put the leap days for 2016 and 2020 at the bottom, watch otu for those
also there are two days in december 2019 where discord crashed and no information was obtainable
yeah, so like
not overlapping
just going straight from the server's beginning to now
you know it
is there anywhere i can just download the 2016 version of microsoft office, i cannot stand the idea of paying for the up to date versions year after year
i'd rather rip my own eyelids off
for some reason i've just never bothered with transferring it over to google drive
i should _probably_ do that just for the sake of accessibility and stability
i tried that, couldn't figure out what i was doing once i had it
here's what i have to say to that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTpIGbik9k0
_only gods can know such beauty_
the one where it's just one line from beginning to end should be more readable
i don't remember when i started collecting data
pretty sure it was late 2017 or early 2018
i've collected it manually myself, but for all of the data prior to when i started i had ceru use aradiabot to scrape that information
i doublechecked some random dates and it all checked out
if i were still using microsoft excel i would be able to construct the graph on there, but openoffice is too unstable for that
i'm trying to get a copy of office, probably an older one would suffice just fine
office 2013 was offline, wasn't it
because i'm rpetty sure a problem with 2016 is that it's connected to office 365, so microsoft can be like "NOT A VALID COPY"
i fucking hate subscription based software
it's a complete racket
getting caught in the rain?
if you're into champagne
but nah i haven't gotten around to writing any spat entries
i have notes for a few days but that's it
plenty has happened
<:squinting:538174601146925066>
thanks i'll keep that in mind next time i have the ability to make graphs
the software i have now fucking sucks and can't handle the amount of data i'm throwing at it
eh
activity gradually declined each year after 2017, but this year it's increased
like i said earlier, we already surpassed the number of messages we had in 2019, and we still have two months left in the year
quarantine probably has something to do with it
there's also been a much higher level of controversy than last year
one thing's for sure though, there is some relationship between the number of new people you get and the number of messages in chat
like, if you have a period of time where you experience a high number of newcomers, you'll probably see a correspnding increase in activity
this also increases user retention due to newcomers seeing <#152981670507577344> being active
it's kind of cyclical
also hst is correct
oh like on a general basis, no, most people have already put that stuff out of their minds
during the time though, it tended to generate huge amounts of discussion for at least a week
and there was a LOT of shit like that earlier in the year
from like january to march
sure but we're already off of that
i will say though, the day with the greatest activity in here for the election, we saw about 13,000 messages
that's fucking _absurd_ for mspa-lit, i don't know that we've ever had more messages than that in one day
well, i've enjoyed having you guys back
oh i'm sure we'll continue for a while tera
i've never doubted that HSD would physically exist for like... quite some time
for me it's more a question of what precisely things will look like
yeah
/r/place was like lightning in a bottle
the only other thing that came close was the button
the other april fool's shit they've done has sucked hard
what are you DOING
are you still working on the first graph i was telling you about
what the fuck are you talking about concatenating columns
on a typical day it's about 10 new users per day on average
give or take
ever since makin took out adspace it's been over 30-40 per day
nat you fucking moron
this is literally what i'm talking about

why the actual fuck are you concatenating columns
that makes no sense
literally just have all the days in a row REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
fuck this i'm just going with the months instead for expediency
that is precisely what i'm talking about
i don't know what you mean by concatenating columns
literally just copy paste the data into the right spots and then create a graph out of it
why would you not just copy paste the shit it takes four secons
well apparently it's not as stupid as it sounds, because i got it done in like one minute and it's taken you an HOUR
MISS FUCKING MAKE EVERYTHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT NEEDS TO BE
PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS PROGRAMMER
<:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE:250042322266488842>
but nah i'm just gonna do it by month instead of by day because then the program won't crash

wow, i think i love this video
it's just a worm, they're barely above jellyfish in terms of being animals
or i guess it's a caterpillar
still, arthropods
maybe i'm just desensitized
what is this fucking abomination
it wasn't up to date
and then you can see it starts to turn up slightly there at the end
yeah, i manually change my computer's timezone each night when it's time to take stats
yeah
i don't remember at all
let me check if i wrote an entry about it
apparently that day we also had a community stream?
we had just hit 10,000 members
ah, no, it was the rapture
the second reckoning
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGBYrfTs1dmPwpl5raI3I0c1Ut7cUfmxz0xW-4FKLsg/edit#heading=h.kduozi5okxrr
yep
yeah that loaded, why
<@!257144766901256192> fuck you go to bed
you heard me
yes
i've often considered it, but never actually done it
tattoos are expensive and also it would be kind of dumb to have something on my body that 100% undeniably links me to this account
i really, really hope this isn't the big news for this month
it's good that pesterquest is now available in another store but this will not have been worth the hype up
jesus fuckin christ
and here i was, retaining some hope for the property's future
i don't know, i figured releasing hiveswap act 2 would have some kind of effect
wait
that hasn't happened yet
okay, hold on
i just woke up
all i remember from my dream is that misha and i were hanging out, then we started yelling about hillary clinton
shut up tyler the creator
also telltale games _do_ suck
i guess they're more about the story than being a game, but they occupy such an awkward space that doesn't really work for what they were trying to do
everyone went nuts for the telltale walking dead game and i fucking hated it
never seen code geass, might as well get in on this
what is the implication nik
D--> whois 207991389613457408
fuck, i don't remember how to use this command

my reaction to this entire debacle
yeah i've never seen code geass, or a vast majority of stuff really
this is liquifying my brain though
i don't like this warning
take it back
i don't like it
you're saying things that make me upset
how many episodes of this are there
i'm gonna shit my pants
shut up zent
you are a wiener
alright, nah
i have to intercede dero
i definitely see some portion of our hometown trying to engage in this stuff
but 1000 is like... half of the population of our town
that's just not accurate
the 47% number is not right, 47% of all voters went for trump but i don't think all of them would be diehard supporters who engage in a coup
there's a complicated fraction at play here
try not to be so reductionist
<@!193814482420498432> you're even more guilty of this
```THE OUTGROUP WOULD KILL ME THEN KILL THEMSELVES JUST SO THEY CAN KILL ME AGAIN AND SEND ME TO OMEGA HELL``` while dero's suggestion is pretty wild, you're trying to make it seem like there's NO THREAT AT ALL of this happening, as if there's no one who would ever actually engage in the rhetoric that dero is suggesting
you're basically being a conversational douche dick
trump is not popular within the army or the secret service, no
we're not talking about the military though, i thought we were talking about like the civilian population
there is no small number of people who would support an attempted coup if it was donald trump at the head of things
that may sound like it's an exaggeration but it's not
i'm sure you've all seen examples of these people on twitter and facebook by now
i don't think that most of them would _participate_ in the coup, just that they would support attempts by trump to unlawfully retain power
kamala, yeah
yeah that sounds realistic
<:revDave:630205609077112842>
it depends on why/how it's considered good
discuss this
yes, in fact i am

with that horribly low effort meme out of the way, i need to figure out what to do with my afternoon
i just stole it from /r/anime_irl
i don't know shit about anime
man, people forgetting to switch to ther fake alternate accounts will never not be funny
dero they're not saying that trump got more minority votes than biden, they're just saying that trump got more minority votes than previous republican candidates typically did
you're not really seeing the point
just because biden got more minority votes than trump doesn't mean that future democratic candidates will still get the minority vote
this is part of a _trend_
a gradual shifting in voting tendencies among minority populations
you can... literally see it in the data
if things continue as they have been, that's what the data tells us will happen
now, democrats could be smart and change up their strategies
and if that happens, then indeed, minorities might keep voting for them more than republicans
but you have to understand what the fuck a trend is
dero's got a point, yeah, weren't we all talking about how polls weren't terribly reliable before the election happened and then we had a somewhat unexpected set of results
dero that's being too reductive
we can at least take an _educated guess_
predictive numbers aren't the end all be all but there is real meaning to them that can be determined
if you understand what numbers you're looking at and why you have them, you can figure shit out pretty reliably
then again, this is _people_ we're talking about
i'm used to looking at dirt numbers
dirt isn't too unpredictable
wow
that's some intense constipation
i hope it's a big one
rupert murdoch is a disgusting, vile human being
thank god he's almost dead
and his son doesn't feel the same way about how to treat their media empire
his son is apparently a libertarian
it's a pretty big mess
i don't really believe that
it'll be hard to say until we have future points of reference
they've already been trying to shut down mail-in voting
the adage is that, the easier it is to vote, the more people turn out to vote, and the more people turn out to vote, the more republicans lose
murdoch probably sees the writing on the wall as far as the election is concerned and wants to put distance between fox and the former trump administration
trump is dusting off old plans to start an independent news network
i'm not sure how much of murdoch's plans here are truly calculated or if he underestimated the amount of crazy trump folk there are out there now
at least in more rural areas
in the city it's certainly less pronounced
makin is an enlightened centrist
ignore him
<:fatHusky:295293991438516228>
TUBEY
yeah, for as much as i hate murdoch, he's effective because he understands the meaning of subtlety and long-term planning
trump by comparison is some kind of wailing temper tantrum child who gets what he wants by bullying people constantly
trump is able to reap what people in politics long before him have sown, but he's not planting anything for the future either
or at least, i think that's what this is amounting to
i could be wrong of course, but i just don't see how the republican party gains its identity back in a post-trump political arena
they're probably always going to be haunted by some form of the tea party or another
they have no sense of purpose
they have to throw their bodies at something or they go nuts
"Yep."
"Hai."

<:monkaS:388856418498904068>
what do you think about this cultural war that's starting up between japan and south korea, misha
where korea asked japan to apologize for all of the slavery for like a car company or something generations ago
and japan was like, "get fucked bitch, that's in the past"
well, apparently that kind of programming is funny in japan
i'm just like
okay, i'm comparing this to like kpop live reality shows or whatever
i feel like i'm approaching this with a highly significant lack of understanding
jesus fucking christ
there's a lot of cultural exchange between japan and america, it was bound to happen eventually
we get their video games, they get our horrible social views
yeah
i remember reading that near the end of his life, malcom basically saw that the writing was on the wall and he was likely to be killed at some point
and then he did, in his 40s
yeah
apparently
but we have no idea where we are, then

yoda_anakin4
this was years before sydlexia, so i had no firm internet identity
sometimes though, i've considered retiring this name and coming up with something else
but at the same time, this has become something that's pretty firmly a part of my identity
when i'm out getting food and the cashier asks what name to call for, i just say "drew" now
using my real name leads to the cashier asking "what did you say?" and invariably prnouncing it wrong
yeah it would, wouldn't it
it's hard to answer stuff like that
like, would you be able to answer if i asked you the same thing
well, depending on the job i get i might need to start shaving
it just depends

fucking chimpanzees
give that fucker a snare drum
attention to symmetry is surmised to be a trait common in most higher order animals
the prevailing theory is that most healthy animals will be symmetrical, ie all of their limbs
and if that symmetry is broken it signals something in the brain of potential mates to stay away because they won't give suitable offspring
it was just an example, you can also have both limbs but one of them is injured or something
a bird might have gotten mauled by a predator but escaped, and has permanent damage in one wing
a mate will see that and go "nah, that fucker isn't in good shape, i don't want my kids having no bitch ass parent"
pls

making your own chips/fries is always more satisfying though, especially if you can get the right amount of seasoning
my family likes to soak the fries in sugar water before frying them

yeah tensei, i'm just getting back into the motions of it
i went on a nice 3 mile walk today and did my routine
it's not very extensive but i don't really have any goals in mind
gonna put more weights on my bars friday and see where that puts me
i can still do 3 sets of 15 reps with 25 lbs no issue at all, so clearly more weight is needed
probably gonna go up to 30 and see where that puts me
situps are also not so bad
now i just need to fix my diet and lose some fucking weight and i should start making some real progress <:happybear:349682233352781825>

like, sweat positively pouring down their face as they type it out

i mean, language making sense is all relative
also we kind of have that too, it's a matter of dialect
hell, we have infinite ways to call things depending on your geographical location
see: the eternal fight between "soda," "coke," "pop," and other variations
i can imagine saying something like that in specific contexts
when people are panicking do you ever say they're "running around like a chicken with its head cut off"
yeah
i want you to draw this concept carl
did you tell him "you need to know people who have lots of money or else it doesn't work"
tay that thing looks it weighs at least 30 pounds
how is wales doing now that the race has been called for biden
is he still super nervous because of the possibility of an unpeaceful transfer of power or is he feeling a little better
i can't imagine conical bullets being able to go through a bent barrel, but round shot? probably easier to do
eesh
well, i hope he's doing better, but that doesn't sound good
also i think i see what carl is saying
the stereotype for a revolver is six shots, he's just asking if you can make a bigger revolver to fit more shots of the same caliber in
which, the answer is yes, you have guns that go up to like 8 or more rounds
could it be that my tendency to give everyone the benefit of the doubt has proven my downfall once again?
bam says that, and here i am
routinely checking discord multiple times when i'm not busy
i have notifications on
i get pinged
if i notice it, i drop what i'm doing
"what must i do now"
a lugubrious denizen of the HSD contacts me
"a mod made fun of me"
i kill them
hi let's not do that
YOU'RE GONNA PAY
i like how the vast majority of recognizable lines from freddy got fingered are conveyed in a hoarse scream
that's the true mind fuck, is that drew barrymore and tom green were at one point _married_
is drew barrymore known for prolonged fits of insanity
i'm also inclined to think that his actions were at least more purposeful than not
there's too many things that went _right_ in that movie for it to have been completely by accident, certainly in juxtaposition with all of the stuff that's straight up horrible
never forget the scene in the restaurant where he's looking for the cartoon producer and one random diner has a cast with the middle finger stuck out
just inserted in the middle of everything without comment
a mocking? no
a celebration? yes
there _were_ no gross out comedies yet, fgf basically kickstarted them
it was the establishment of the gross out genre
oh, shit, you might be right
i was barely cognizant as a human being when fgf came out i'm probably full of shit
regardless of that i don't think it's mocking gross out comedies, i think it's like the apotheosis of them
"force it on others here" that's the fun of the movie
we should definitely watch it again at some point
the question is when
YOU'RE A LIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
yeah moon, it feels like you're going into the deep end just a bit
you gotta take a step back
he owes something like hundreds of millions of dollars
and his real worth isn't that high
that's what you get for not paying attention to politics
you miss out on all the juicy bullshit
well, point is that trump's in deep shit
i mean, he might be able to live off of grifting his cult members for the rest of his life, but i hope he gets his just desserts
he's probably not going to be held accountable though
that's just how it is in amorca
a leg in one hand
and a brerb in the other
<a:blair:424571787372658708>
<@!207991389613457408> holy shit, i just woke up from a dream where you were DMing a ttrpg that had something to do with a really dystopian, vaguely cyberpunk future where the players all have like less powerful versions of those robot suits from code geass
it was a mix of really intense combat using the suits and then careful espionage while not using them
i mean, the robots could walk or roll around, i don't think that we as humans had roller skates though
ree
i agree, middle
also yark that's fucking horrifying
what is it with people from the HSD witnessing death or receiving injury lately
yeah, eyeball damage is no joke
that shit's really easy to get permanently fucked
take care of yourself yark
"i-it's a joke about--"
"ii'm going to have to ask you to leave"
i would do that as a joke
upload a video once a day where i eat bread
